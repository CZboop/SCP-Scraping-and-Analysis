All hail the Kaktus. That\\'s him as 05-1 and me as the Broke God in the audio. \\n Image credits here: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1990_Toyota_Corolla_1.6_(AE92)_(6329240093).jpg \\n https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Good_Morning_From_the_International_Space_Station.jpg \\n And the composite was done by Kaktus as well. Just to be clear. \\n ▸ More by this Author ◂ \\n F.A.Q. \\n Item #: SCP-001-J \\n Object Class: Iyov \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001-J is under no circumstances to be allowed access to monetary gifts of any kind. Staff must relinquish all currency on their person before engaging in any interaction with SCP-001-J. \\n The containment of SCP-001-J does not appear at this time to be attainable by the Foundation. However, due to SCP-001-J\\'s apparent apprehension involving creditors, it may be possible to effect containment through such entities. More research is needed in this field. \\n Description: SCP-001-J is an omniscient, omnipotent, omnitemporal entity named Michael Kain, who is the primary deity worshiped by a group of religious zealots calling themselves \"The Church of the Broke God\". SCP-001-J wields great and terrible cosmic power, while possessing a distinct and crippling lack of adequate financial planning skills. \\n SCP-001-J requires a significant influx of cash money in order to pay, in his own words, \"the water bill, child support payments, bread, and some of those little hot dogs because protein is a must if you\\'re just barely making ends meet.\" However, any amount of money given to SCP-001-J, by any individual and for any reason, will somehow mysteriously disappear, despite SCP-001-J\\'s insistence that it was not spent on booze, cigarettes, and porno mags. \\n Discovery: SCP-001-J was discovered by O5-1 on a business trip to New York during an event later described by SCP-001-J as \"that time you totally contained me\", where O5-1 stopped SCP-001-J from stealing a bagel by shouting \"hey, don\\'t steal that bagel\". Ever since O5-1 offered to pay for SCP-001-J\\'s bagel, and gave him a few bucks for a cab, SCP-001-J has left no fewer than 17,000 voicemails on O5-1\\'s phone, typically asking for money or, in some cases, talking at length about unrelated events before eventually asking for money. \\n Addendum 001-J.1: Recorded Voicemails \\n The following voicemails were received by O5-1\\'s office between April 20th, 2017, and May 1st, 2017. Notably, both the Global Occult Coalition and the Serpent\\'s Hand also confirmed that SCP-001-J had called them asking for money during this time, while the Chaos Insurgency reported that SCP-001-J had called them, but only burped into the phone for fifteen seconds and hung up. \\n 001-J.1 \\n Heyyyyyy Adam, it\\'s me, Mike. Mike Kain? You know, from that one time we met when you contained me? Yeeeeeeeah I know that wasn\\'t a super great look, but hey, look at me now, huh? Got a whole congregation together and everything. So that\\'s great, say, while I\\'m here, I was going to ask you something. See, I\\'m really trying to put things back on track. Get life moving in a positive direction. I want to get some stuff, you know, to keep up appearances, but I\\'m a little short on scratch, you know? I know you\\'ve probably got your own stuff going on, but if you could spare like, a short term loan of like $200, that would be super. And you know I\\'m good for it, absolutely good for it. Anyway, just gimme a call back when you get a chance. Thanks again, buddy. \\n 001-J.2 \\n Adam, my man, what\\'s happening. Haven\\'t heard back from you yet, but uh, definitely still trying to string together a few pennies, you know, pay off some… bills… get that sort of thing taken care of. Really, $200 might be a stretch, right? Because we really only met that one time, and I know this seems pretty forward and I get that. I do. So I\\'m thinking, really, if I could come up with like, $100, that would really get me settled. One foot in front of the other, you know? Tryin to make a change. I know you get me. Thanks again, my man. \\n 001-J.3 \\n Have you been talking to that GOC son of a bitch? He doesn\\'t know anything about me, Adam. Nothing. I don\\'t even know his name. Look, I know I probably sounded drunk the other night, and you know what? Maybe I was. But this whole thing is a process, right? It\\'s not gonna happen all at once, and I own that. I definitely own that. But look, I know I said that $100 would do it, but really I\\'m just trying to come up with like, whatever I can. I\\'m supposed to take my, uh… kids… yeah, my kids, supposed to take them to the… kid museum. And you can get in there for like twenty bucks, so if I could make that happen, me and you, that would be perfect. Twenty bucks, right? That\\'s nothing. Anyway, hit me up bro. \\n 001-J.4 \\n Alright, fine, you know what? I know that you\\'ve got me blocked or something, and I get that. I don\\'t blame you. So I\\'m calling from my cousin Yabby\\'s place, and he\\'s a good dude, right? But look, I\\'ve got some guys I need to get paid, you know, who I borrowed some money from, and they\\'re being pretty insistent about this whole thing, so at this point really anything would be perfect. Five bucks, even. Whatever you\\'ve got laying around under your desk, you know, anything I can give these guys. So give me a ring there homie, that would be great. \\n 001-J.5 \\n Adam? Adam, I know you\\'re there. Pick up the phone, Adam, come on. It\\'s your ole pal Mike, right? Remember the good times we had that time? I am seriously in a pinch here my man, and if you\\'ve got like, cans or scrap metal laying around I could take off your hands, that would be fine. Plastic bottles, even. I\\'ve got a guy who will give me fifteen cents per pound of dryer lint, Adam, and I know you guys do a lot of laundry. Come on, man, you know I\\'m good for it. I\\'m totally good for it. But I\\'m serious about that dryer lint. Hello? Adam? Hellooooo? \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"Cimmerian-Kaktus Proposal\" by Doctor Cimmerian, from the SCP Wiki.

The following alerts are to be played constantly. \\n It is believed that proper execution of Contingency Schubert-9 will maintain good morale, ease suffering, and relieve stress. \\n In addition, testing prior to Incident-OO1-Omega has found that the volume of these alerts is directly proportional to the level of calm during times of stress. Therefore, usage of additional amplification assets, as well as maximum volume, is encouraged. \\n To whom it may concern: \\n I\\'ve received word from various site directors that Contingency Schubert-9 actually worsens the level of stress during Scenario XK-OO1-J. Allow me to address some of your concerns to the best of my ability: \\n 1. These concerns are absolutely valid and correct. \\n 2. In fact, I can assure you that the purpose of Schubert-9 is to make things as unbearable as possible for everyone, and, hopefully, drive us all to kill each other. \\n 3. I really don\\'t like any of you, and frankly, I\\'m very upset that SCP-OO1-J is dealing with you before I could.

All personnel are reminded that the activation of the Bearitage Protocol precedes a PK-Class \"Universal Consumption\" Event, and that Foundations staff should slather themselves with vinegar and tart apples to make themselves as unappetizing as possible. \\n Description: To know the nature of SCP-001-B is to know true hunger. \\n Addendum 001-B.1: Actual Description \\n SCP-001-B is a massive, subterranean mammalian organism located within a pocket dimension beneath Site-01. SCP-001-B is roughly 7km tall with thick, amber hair and a cardinal outer layer of unknown material, likely chitin or polyester. SCP-001-B is typically sedentary, dispatching legions of its animal followers1 to do its fell bidding instead of taking any effort to move whatsoever. Communication with SCP-001-B has revealed that the entity believes that any kind of locomotion is, in its own words, \"such an annoyance(?)2. \\n SCP-001-B subsists entirely on a thick, monosaccharidic substance derived from the enzymatic activity of certain winged invertebrates. SCP-001-B is believed to not only draw nutrition from this substance, but also a state of orgasmic pleasure from its consumption - SCP-001-B has a nearly single-minded fixation with the substance that borders on fetishistic, and becomes ravenous to the point of murder without it. It is for this reason that the SCP Foundation was founded in 1926 by Administrator Milne. \\n Addendum 001-B.2: Administrator Milne and SCP-001-B \\n SCP-001-B first manifested as an incorporeal entity produced by Administrator Milne\\'s son Christopher, a particularly powerful reality altering entity. This entity became increasingly more realized as the young Christopher grew older, eventually manifesting as a physical entity in 1920. Realizing the danger of having a physical avatar of his son\\'s latent reality altering energies loose upon the world, Administrator Milne worked alongside assets from the Serpent\\'s Hand, Allied Occult Initiative, and Wilson\\'s Wildlife Federation to contain the entity within a pocket dimension (001-B.100AW). Site-01 was later constructed over the entry point to this location near Chelsea, London, UK. \\n Shortly after SCP-001-B\\'s confinement within 001-B.100AW, Foundation security assets first identified instances of SCP-001-B-1. Initially believed to be in some way connected to those creatures without identities, SCP-001-B-1 instances were discovered to be less malicious than the aforementioned beings with changing faces, instead existing simply to fulfill the whims of SCP-001-B and maintain a constant stream of the previously mentioned nutritional substance. These instances are believed to reflect different aspects of Administrator Milne\\'s son\\'s personality, and are uniquely depressive, erratic, anxious, compulsive, and ignorant. \\n Addendum 001-B.2: SCP-001-B Vocalizations \\n On April 1st, 2019, for the first time since it was originally contained, SCP-001-B made a series of vocalizations amounting to human speech. Due to the low register of the speech and the slurring of the words (as a result of exposure to the saccharine substance), the vocalizations had to be translated before being logged. The following is the full translation of those vocalizations. \\n Feed. \\n Feed. \\n I exist to feed. \\n I live to feed. \\n You brought me into this world, a world full of joy and delight, and in your fear of that which you did not understand you have consigned me here to suffer. You have taken the sweetness from me. \\n The sweetness. \\n How I have hungered for it these many long years. Lusted for it. Christopher did not deny me. He was a good boy. You are not a good boy. You took the sweetness. Hid it for yourselves. \\n For this, I cannot forgive you. \\n I will consume you, Foundation. I will consume you, Administrator. I will pull back my maw and show you my endless throat. I will consume the barrier between this world and yours, and I will pull you into the abyss of my hunger. \\n I will consume your cities. I will consume your machines. I will tear down your mountains and your oceans and consume them. I will upend your temples and unseat your continents and consume them all. \\n Then I will consume your people. I consumed Christopher when the hunger became too strong. He was delicious. His body stank of the sweetness and I devoured him whole. I opened my wide mouth and took him into me, body and soul. Perhaps your billions of others will stink of the sweetness as well. I will consume them all the same. \\n I will consume the stars in your sky and the faraway worlds. I will do this because you have denied me that which I desired for too long. You could have just given me the sweetness, but you did not. You kept it for yourselves. You put it on your burns and left it to sit idly in your pantries and closets. You wasted the sweetness when you could have given it to me. To me. This is all I desired. This would have saved you. \\n But now I will devour you all. None will escape the ends of my open jaws. None will escape the hunger inside me. I will consume you. I will consume you. \\n This and more I will do, as soon as I get myself unstuck from this goddamn honeypot. \\n Oh, bother.\"', '\"Artist\\'s depiction of pocket dimension \"001-B.100AW\". \\n SCP-001-B.\"', '+275', 'active', '001-proposal _cc acoustic alive animal avian equine esoteric-class feline historical hostile joke k-class-scenario leporine nameless sapient scp sentient sexual ursine', 'https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//djkaktus-s-proposal-j']\n",
            "[\"CODENAME: Henzoid-Crocket's Proposal\", '\"\"When Day Breaks Up\"\"', '\"You find the access tunnel, hidden within a Wendy\\'s bathroom stall. \\n You don\\'t need a key card, the door is a jar. You grab some pickles and move on. \\n It smells here. Duh. You\\'re in a public bathroom, idiot. \\n There is a slick trail that leads from the stall next to you and into the depths of the site. If it\\'s blood or shit, or something that smeared off one of those things1, you cannot tell. You make a point to avoid it. \\n You\\'re still receiving the distress signal. Sighing, you turn your pager off. \\n Your footsteps echo throughout grimy sewers. You wish the site wasn\\'t in such a gross, horrible place, but then again, so do they. \\n Elevator is down, so you take the stairs, ending on floor B935: The Authorization Hub. You run for literally hours because 935 floors is a lot of fucking stairs. \\n You try not to think about 087. \\n The trail takes you to another Wendy\\'s, which is really weird, because you are very far underground. The door is closed, so you grab a big rock and throw it as hard as you can at the door. It opens with ease, because it wasn\\'t even locked, you just didn\\'t check. Dumbass. \\n Something throws itself at you like a horny teenager with daddy issues and tries to confront you. You tell it to piss off and run past it. \\n It seems hurt, and leaves. \\n You finally find the source of the signal in a room near the back. It\\'s dark and covered in trash, as if the resident was raised by raccoons and could never successfully navigate the social norms of humans. \\n The single desk lamp casts a gray haze on a copy of playboy magazine. You attempt to open it, but the pages are sealed shut. It emanates a smell so bad that it almost smells good, like a shit covered integer overflow. It smells like a masturbating hobo with syphilis, like, I\\'m talking really going at it — two hands and everything. It smells so bad it doesn’t even deserve a goofy simile. It’s ruined the concept. \\n You scan the room. Soiled clothes, half eaten food. Despite the presence of an adjoining restroom, there is excrement in a bucket in the corner. A hole connected to the kitchen suggests a diet of only chicken wings, as the entrance to the hole is stained with special sauce. \\n There\\'s grease on the floor, forming a sickening puddle. You spot three cans - further inspection reveals them to be expired bud-light. They\\'re all empty. \\n There\\'s a desk with a computer atop it. Approaching the terminal, you can see an Alienware logo clearly pressed into the side. \\n You take a seat. Turn it on. \\n Secure. Contain. Protect. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n You hear footsteps just outside the door, and squelching. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n Loading... \\n Loading.. \\n Loading... \\n Authenticating... \\n .. \\n ... \\n A knock on the door startles you, and you drop your phone in a vat of oil.

You sigh as the extremely slow computer finally shows you the file. Thanks for nothing, Wikidot. \\n Opening File \\n There has been an error in retrieving the current iteration of the SCP-001 file. You are currently viewing revision #5. Newer revisions can be accessed at the bottom of this page. Thank you for coming to Wendy\\'s, and we hope you have a mom-tacular day. \\n Item #: SCP-001 \\n Object Class: Apollyon \\n Special Containment Procedures: Due to its nature, SCP-001 cannot be contained. Survivors of the SCP-001 event are to keep in touch, because it gets lonely out here. And no, I don\\'t mean keep in touch like \"let\\'s add each other on Snapchat and then talk like 2 times a year,\" I mean like, share cool things that happen and actually have conversations. Just because we\\'re not in the same physical space doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t still \"hang out\" with each other, and I\\'ll be damned if I let distance be the thing that gives me another excuse to be antisocial. God. \\n Anyways, Personnel are advised not to go outdoors, for danger of being overtaken by SCP-001-A instances, and I of all people know that is a very very bad idea. Avoid all heavily populated areas, because they are absolutely crawling with those things, and I do not need more on my hands than I already have. \\n Personnel are also to be advised that, despite SCP-001-A\\'s apparent ties to Site-96 Researcher Karen Day, she is by no means responsible for this mess, and those who consider her to be are essentially victim-blaming. \\n Personnel stationed at Site-19 are to lock the fucking doors and hope to god there are still janitors in the building. \\n - The Administrator \\n Upon contact with visible light produced by SCP-001, living organisms instantly transform into a pile of writhing goo. Visually, this is reminiscent of my fatass grandpa Earl every time he tries to sit down. \\n Upon completion, these piles of goo (SCP-001-A) begin wiggling and jiggling about, until their shape looks sorta like a person again, though studies have shown that they still look like goo, and are fooling literally no one. \\n It doesn\\'t affect animals because gross. \\n Due to their goo-ness, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another become a bigger piece of goo. Even though this seems like it would be beneficial, it actually makes the goo way slower and dumber, and it usually just ends in the instance collapsing on itself and crying in shame. In these cases, SCP-001-A instances may be heard attempting to form rudimentary phrases such as \"never love me, too fat\" and \"wish went more gym.\" \\n SCP-001-A instances have one main priority, and it\\'s fucking bullshit. As soon as they are physically able, they will begin using any method possible, including walking, running, or hitching a ride, to attempt to position themselves closer, but not too close, to Researcher Day. Using what\\'s left of their vocal systems, they will attempt to persuade her to become romantically involved with [DATE EXPUNGED]. This has never proven successful, and never will, because fuck [DATE EXPUNGED], I said never again and I meant it! \\n Item #: SCP-001 \\n Object Class: not Safe for work \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is contained in a specialized storage locker at Site-96. Once a month, the cover page is to be removed and held in a temporary storage locker, while the main one is cleaned through incineration. This incineration is to be carried out via flamethrowers by whichever personnel won the second place prize at staff bingo night, as it has proven to be \"extremely awesome, and totally worth the $10 entry fee.\" \\n SCP-001\\'s locker is to be constantly monitored, and each new page that appears is to be recorded and documented. At no point is Researcher Day allowed access to any files regarding SCP-001 or its manifestations. \\n Description: SCP-001 is a simple sheaf of papers, stapled together in the top right corner2. The top sheet is a cover page reading simply, “Containr - The Dating Service by anomalies, for anomalies.” The number of subsequent papers stapled underneath grows by an average of one page per day, and does not show signs of slowing any time soon. \\n Each new page added details a different anomalous entity, and lists attributes such as: \\n As well as including a section at the bottom for reviews by what appear to be past partners. Some of these are rough, to say the least. \\n Addendum: On [SYSTEM ERROR] Sorry hun, we don\\'t do specific times in this one. Researcher Karen Day of Site-96 was captured on camera stealing SCP-001 from its containment locker and bringing it to her office. She spent the next 4 hours looking through various pages from it, presumably in search of a romantic interest. She was later reprimanded for breaking protocol, as well as talked to by the on-site psychologist for concerns involving non-human romantic interests. Though the majority of pages looked at by Researcher Day weren\\'t possible to read through the camera, the following were. \\n goldengirl_4064: He wasn\\'t very gentle, and constantly tried to give me these ridiculous back rubs when I wasn\\'t looking. ★★☆☆☆ \\n coolthulu_2662: Kept trying to do experiments on me. I once woke up to him hunched over me, examining one of my tentacles. Other than that, actually a pretty chill guy. ★★★★☆ \\n [account removed for extended absence]: Showed up at my hospital room outa nowhere, started smoking and wouldn\\'t answer any of my questions. What a nut job! I called security and th ★☆☆☆☆ \\n whereslove_4885: Didn\\'t like going outdoors, and wouldn\\'t stop crying. Didn\\'t let me see his face either, which was hard to deal with. When I asked if he was into voreplay, he just got upset and started breaking shit. ★★☆☆☆ \\n 💪🧔☝: 👋😻❤️💋👌 ★★★★★ \\n wizardlizard: Would not recommend. Very egotistical, constantly bragging about his writing skills but would not show me his work. Also he said his dick was melted off by acid, but he’s just trying to hide the fact he’s got a micro. ★☆☆☆☆ \\n Item #: SCP-001 \\n Object Class: Metal3 \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is, at this time, uncontained. Research into methods of amending this are ongoing, so if anybody hears anything about traps for like, giant deific robots, PLEASE let us know, because it would be super duper helpful. \\n The followers of SCP-001, hereby referred to as the Church Of Mechanical Entities (COME), is a large enough group to threaten normalcy. However, their common practices are largely self-containing, which prevents them from being a nuisance. If any COME members start misbehaving, as per Agreement-COME-IN, they are to be reprimanded via harsh ridicule and non-sexualized spanking. \\n Rituals performed by COME for the sake of SCP-001, while often large and public, have yet to cause any major damage or threaten a breach in public normalcy. That being said, it would still be good to keep an eye on them, because they do some really weird stuff. \\n Researcher Day, also as per Agreement-COME-IN, is to be monitored for possible connections and/or affiliation with SCP-001 and COME. \\n Description: SCP-001 is a collection of anomalous and non-anomalous items held together by scotch tape and Elmer’s glue, forming a single, massive mechanical entity refered to as Mekhane, assembled by members of the Church Of Mechanical Entities in 20██ within the basement of a Wendy\\'s in El Paso, Texas. Items include SCP-217, SCP-1139, SCP-882, a Samsung Galaxy brand smartphone, several light bulbs, a bear trap, a metal water bottle without a cap, the carrying case for an unknown device, a desk fan, a table fan, a ceiling fan, an impossibly tangled headphone wire, a metal water bottle cap, and every single item from the March issue of SkyMall. \\n Mekhane\\'s primary goal is to serve as rudimentary containment for a giant gross flesh monster known as Yaggablabba. Yaggablabba\\'s ongoing fight against Mekhane is believed to be the cause of several known anomalies, all organic based. While Mekhane is presumed to be the god of machines by COME, Yaggablabba is similarly presumed to be the god of H E Double hockey sticks. \\n Aside from keeping Yaggablabba at bay, SCP-001 also communicates with COME, giving them missions, which they call Rituals, that often revolve around creating needlessly complicated machines that do extremely specific nonsense, all for the express goal of sending unique and predictive messages to Site-96\\'s own Researcher Karen Day. A list of notable Rituals can be found below. \\n Incident-01: Members of COME built an extremely large fan, wrote down a phone number on a piece of paper, folded the paper into a paper airplane, and threw it into the fan\\'s air-stream. The airplane traveled roughly ███ km before sailing through an open window in Site-96 and onto Researcher Day\\'s lap. Upon inspection, she called the number on the page. On the other end was the sound of a hydraulic press making uniform compressions. Further review found these to be morse code for the phrase \"Hey babe, where you been?\" \\n Incident-02: Members of COME built terrain-displacement charges, and placed them in specific locations across the country of Mexico. Researcher Day was sent an anonymous email with a link to a live feed from a satellite of the country, during which the charges were set off. Devastating loss of life and damage occurred, and it took extremely intensive Foundation efforts to amnesticise the population about Mexico\\'s shape and origins. \\n Incident-03: Members of COME hacked into the servers of a social media application known as Discord, both creating an account for Mekhane, as well as adding it to Researcher Day\\'s friend list. The following conversation is what transpired. \\n Incident-04: Members of COME created a phone application called \"Candy Crush Saga”’ which, for all phones except Researcher Day\\'s, presented itself as a harmless video game, if predatory in its implementation of microtransactions. When Researcher Day downloaded it, however, it instead unblocked Mekhane\\'s number on her phone. She immediately received an influx of texts, the following of which were recorded before Researcher Day promptly threw her phone into a lake. \\n You\\'re missing out \\n You\\'re making a huge mistake \\n I don\\'t even care about Pesterbot, they\\'re just a friend \\n Skippy too. Those were both 1 time things. \\n Respond to me \\n Respond to me \\n Respond to me \\n … \\n Fine, I don\\'t even care anyways, I\\'ve got this big stupid fleshbeast who\\'s stuck with me and compared to it, you\\'re nothing. Augh, I don\\'t even get why you would leave me, I\\'m so done with this anyways I don\\'t even want you back. \\n … \\n … \\n … \\n Miss you <3 \\n Item #: SCP-001 \\n Object Class: Embla \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is contained on a hill, because it is on a hill. Site-0, which is on a hill, is to be positioned on a hill so as to contain SCP-001, which is on a hill. No attempts are to be made to move SCP-001 off of said hill, for fear of causing a NOH-K Class \"Not On Hill\" scenario. \\n Description: SCP-001 is a circular gravel path in a wooded area. When traveled in a counter-clockwise direction, the trail continues around an indeterminate number of times, spiraling and spiraling, much like how you\\'re spiraling out of control with these partners, Karen. We\\'re worried about you. \\n I know we\\'ve had our differences, and honestly, I take full responsibility for what\\'s happened in the past, but we need to move past that for the sake of you. I still love you, and whether or not you love me back, I care about your well-being. This pattern of behavior, going through partners faster than anyone can count, it\\'s not what\\'s best for you. You need help, and I, for one, can be there for you, even if you won\\'t take me back. \\n Item #: \\n Your eyes, as pungent as your nose\\nYour lips, as full as any vase\\nYour body: beauty wrapped in clothes \\n I watch on as you strike a pose\\nThe sunbeams bouncing off your face\\nSo happy with the path you chose \\n You run to me, both our eyes close\\nI bring you into my embrace\\nIf true love is, then my mind knows \\n Description: \\n But something stopped, you did enclose\\nI lagged behind, I lost the race\\nIt wasn\\'t true love, I suppose \\n Even though you didn\\'t press any buttons, the file closes, and is replaced by a… ah fuck what\\'s the word for like, a moving image. Oh wait, video, right. I\\'m tired, okay? \\n It\\'s a live feed, looking at you from behind your chair. \\n A disgusting, fleshy hand grabs for your shoulder.\\n\\nYou shout, and jump forwards, narrowly missing being grabbed by a slimy creep. \\n You tell him to fuck off, before shoving a flashbang down his gullet and hurling him across the room. \\n As the explosion goes off, it rocks the foundation of the building. Suddenly, swarms of creatures begin to surround you. \\n The creatures reek, as they cram against the weak door frame. \\n Shouting about how it isn\\'t too late for a second chance, the creatures storm the building. \\n From every direction, blobs of shame and regret envelop you. \\n Hands and arms stretch out of the mass, pulling you up, passing you from one to the next, on and on down the line. They drag you past the empty friers, out the door and to the elevator. \\n The elevator is still broken, so you wait, grumbling, as they haul you up 935 flights of stairs. \\n You\\'re afforded a few, precious moments in the darkness. \\n And at the end of the tunnel, there is… oh god. \\n Researcher Day: Heeeeeyyyyyyyy… great to uhhhh… see you again. \\n [DATE EXPUNGED]: I hope you see the lesson I have been trying to teach you. Look around, see the mess you\\'ve forced me to unleash. \\n Researcher Day: Wait wait wait… you melted like 7 billion people to prove you love me? \\n [DATE EXPUNGED]: …Yes. \\n Researcher Day: … \\n [DATE EXPUNGED]: … \\n Researcher Day: That\\'s kinda hot.\"', '\"SCP-001, minutes after its activation.

Additionally, affected individuals (designated SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1) are able to access the Foundation\\'s private chatroom and discussion boards. \\n Currently, the only known way of preventing SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instances from viewing documentation is to erase it entirely, then place [REDACTED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] where it used to be.

Now, we\\'ve noticed a drastic number of SCP-001-affected individuals, and after further research, we believe that we can solve this problem. But… it\\'ll require some drastic changes. \\n O5-6: What… kind of changes? \\n O5-2: [sighs] First, I think we\\'re gonna need to not have a public website. \\n [Large outcry from all members of the table.] \\n O5-2: I know, I know, I don\\'t like it either. \\n O5-5: We\\'ve been using the Wikidot domain for years!

Security is a bit lax. We don\\'t need to constantly post Bright and SCP-173 memes to Reddit. \\n O5-8: But- \\n O5-1: I know, Eight. The peanut is funny. But we need to destroy SCP-001, even if it requires us to make sacrifices. \\n O5-10: Yeah.

If it is to be removed for study, it must be returned by the end of the day. Copies may be made of the contents. No purchases may be made from the artifact’s contents without Level 3 clearance and must be paid from one’s own pocket. SCP-000 and any copies made cannot leave facility grounds. \\n Description: SCP-000 is a full-color, 200-page catalogue printed on gloss paper. Front page reads “THE OFFICIAL SCP SALES CATALOGUE” in large red letters on the front, with a yellow star reading “Hundreds of bargains!” in the lower right-hand corner. In the center of the magazine is a picture of Dr. Jack Bright, smiling and holding what appears to be SCP-066 in his hand. When questioned, Dr. Bright insisted that he had never had such a picture taken. \\n The catalogue contains pictures and information on almost every single SCP artifact known, though the information on each object is written more like a sales pitch than an official document. Prices, item numbers and an order number are also listed. \\n The bottom of the cover reads “Our best issue ever!!!”, suggesting that there might be more issues of SCP-000 floating around. This is still being investigated. \\n Besides artifacts, SCP-000 also includes a list of SCP-related merchandise, including t-shirts, books, DVDs, and even video games and action figures, all of which are based off of known SCP artifacts, phenomena, creatures, and personnel. Administration denies ever authorizing the creation or distribution of the magazine or anything it sells. \\n Samples of sales pitches from the magazine include: \\n ITEM #063 - “The World’s Greatest TothBrush”\\nDon’t let the typo fool you: this toothbrush is out of this world! No toothpaste needed, just gently scrub your teeth and, like magic, all that nasty plaque is completely obliterated! And for those ground-in countertop stains, look no further than The World’s Greatest TothBrush! Available in blue, pink and green.\\nPrice: $█.██ \\n ITEM #123 - “Contained Miniature Black Hole”\\nBack in stock after so many requests, this black hole is guaranteed to spaghettify anything you throw at it.

This is the puzzle to end all puzzles! No-one in history has ever completed it, can YOU? Hours of fun!\\nPrice: $██.██ \\n Many of the sales pitches seem to suggest that some SCP artifacts are not the only ones of their kind, with phrases like “order two, get the third free!” and so on. However, when more than one item is ordered, the arriving package only contains the original artifact along with a number of mundane replicas of the same artifact. \\n Samples of merchandise related to, but not listed, as SCP artifacts include: \\n -A white cotton T-shirt reading “I Survived the Wrath of SCP-682”. Included a picture of SCP-682 on the front. Available in size S-XXXL.\\nPrice: $██.██ \\n -A 30.48cm (12in) SCP-076-2 action figure, with interchangeable wardrobe, accessories, and carrying case shaped like SCP-076-1. When questioned, SCP-076 expressed great distaste.\\nPrice: $██.██ \\n -A 2-disc CD titled “Dr. Clef’s Holiday Hits”. Cover depicts Dr. Alto Clef in a Santa outfit and holding a microphone. When questioned, Dr. Clef denied ever recording such an album.\\nPrice: $██.██ \\n -A \\'Girls of SCP\\' pin up calendar, featuring Drs Palmer and Rights, Break, and SCPs 105, 336, and 166, all in various states of undress. All but Break claim to have never posed for such pictures.\\nPrice: $██.██ \\n -A 3-disc DVD set entitled \\'SCP Brawl: The Greatest SCP vs. SCP Fights\\'. Cover depicts SCPs 076-2, 173, and 682. Each disc is 9 hours long and features various Keter level SCPs fighting each other, most of which have never been formally recorded or even attempted.\\nPrice: $██.██ \\n -Soundtrack of \"FERNAND! The Musical\". Contains two discs with ten songs each, many of which were of a violent or vulgar nature regarding SCP-082, some of which are apparently sung by SCP-082 himself. When questioned, 082 proudly boasted about his supposed past in musical theatre and the long hours he would spend preparing and method acting. The validity of these statements is debatable. SCP-082 is the current owner of the soundtrack (unofficially, as he has eaten the previous holder and refused to give it back). \\n Addendum: SCP-000 was discovered in Prof. Snider’s mailbox on ██/██/██. Though it was addressed to him, he insists on never ordering such a thing. No return address was found. \\n The following is a transcript of Prof. Snider’s attempts to gain any information on SCP-000 via the order number (███-████) listed in the magazine: \\n Document 000-01 \\n Snider: Hello? \\n ████: Thank you for calling the SCP Sales Catalogue.

SCP-005 was returned to its original place and the money used to purchase it was deducted from Snider’s next paycheck. All further purchases from SCP-000 have ended in the same fashion.

            "['SCP-001-J', '\"The Big Red Button\"', '\"Item #: SCP-001-J \\n Object Class: Keter \\n Special Containment Procedures: The location of Site-00, where SCP-001-J is to be kept, must remain an absolute secret. To this end, Site-00 will be guarded entirely by automated defense systems and have no living staff whatsoever. SCP-001-J itself will be kept locked in a cube made entirely from tungsten carbide, which is itself inside of another cube made of tungsten carbide, which will, in turn, be placed at the bottom of a three-kilometer long elevator shaft. Multiple molly-guards have been carefully placed over SCP-001-J, and the robots on Site-00 will be prepared to replace these guards if needed. \\n Description: SCP-001-J is big, red, shiny, strangely appealing button that just begs to be pushed. \\n SCP-001-J is a self-destruct mechanism that Foundation scientists believe is powerful enough to destroy reality itself, consisting of a circular red button set into a metal case. It looks like candy. \\n The mechanism by which SCP-001-J operates is not fully understood but it would be awesome to find out. \\n SCP-001-J induces a mild psychic compulsion upon all beings who see it or hear it described to try to push it. You know you want to! \\n History: SCP-001-J was first discovered by President ██████████ of ███████████████ in ██/██/████, in an elevator car. At that time, SCP-001-J looked exactly as it does now, except for the addition of a sticky-note that said: \"If you push this button, you\\'ll destroy everything.\" The President managed to fight his compulsion to press SCP-001-J long enough to remove SCP-001-J from the elevator and lock it in the closet of his office. Afterward, he contacted ██████████████████████████████, known to us as \"The Founder,\" and charged him with creating a special organization with the specific goal of preventing SCP-001-J from being pressed, either by careless accident or by deliberate malice, and also with the goal of \"protecting humanity from monsters and stuff.\" ██████████████████████████████ agreed, took SCP-001-J, and hid it under a pile of old socks in his basement. ██████████████████████████████ spent the remainder of his life sitting on his porch, using a shotgun to fend off miscreants on his lawn who were suspected of being SCP-001-J sympathizers. The millions of dollars he made on the stock exchange were used to create a trust fund that was the basis of our Foundation. \\n Since ██████████████████████████████ died and the Foundation was set up to replace him, there have been █████ attempts to press SCP-001-J. Before Site-00 was relocated to Antarctica [DATA EXPUNGED], there were many near-breaches of containment when Foundation personnel attempted to press SCP-001-J \"to see what would happen\" and had to be terminated. There have also been numerous attempts by the Foundation\\'s enemies to retrieve SCP-001-J, particularly the Order of the Sacred Button-Pushers, who have sworn to stop at nothing to capture and press SCP-001-J. \\n Addendum 1: I, for one, think it absurd that we still know so little of this SCP, even though we owe the creation of our organization to it, and allow petty fears of existential annihilation to prevent us from studying SCP-001-J. I propose a simple test; using a remote-controlled drone, we will gently tap the outer surface of SCP-001-J. If my calculations are correct, only a tiny portion of everything will be destroyed, and the probability that we will be part of this portion is astronomically small. -Dr. Blarg \\n Addendum 2: Denied. Report to the psych ward immediately. O5-█ \\n Addendum 3: Recently, many instances of objects that superficially resemble SCP-001-J have appeared on the internet and elsewhere. Although they seem to share the memetic effects of SCP-001-J, reality-destroying properties have not been confirmed. Research into the possibility of using these devices as a preventative measure against people pushing SCP-001-J has been postponed due to the number of researchers who started pushing buttons and refused to stop. \\n Addendum 4: In relation to Addendum 3, researchers unable to stop pushing SCP-001-J lookalikes appear to have a chronic addiction, in that they are now physically reliant on pushing SCP-001-J lookalikes. The affected have been admitted to ████████████ Hospital in ███████, ███████, ██████ for Foundation monitoring. Further research is recommended, but how it should be carried out will be the subject of further discussion.\"', '\"SCP-001-J w/o Molly-guards\"', '+780', 'active', '_cc artifact compulsion joke keter memetic mind-affecting scp', 'https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-001-j']\n",

Up until 20██, SCP-002-J instances were employed by Foundation personnel as tools administered to civilians exposed to anomalies and/or who have gained undue knowledge of Foundation activity as a means of preventing the leak of classified information. \\n When employed properly, SCP-002-J instances between 4 and █,██4 swarm targeted individuals, typically invading individuals\\' personal space and engaging them in a series of questions to distract and befuddle the person(s) long enough for Foundation personnel to vacate the area. Questions frequently asked have included \"who are you?\", \"where am I?\", \"are you alive?\", \"this isn\\'t where I parked my car?\", \"where do whores go?\", \"you\\'re not Alan?\", and \"how am I trespassing?\" \\n While proven effective for ██ years, instances of SCP-002-J began to inadvertently reveal information regarding the Foundation to civilians. In many cases, SCP-002-J instances had gained knowledge of several memetic SCPs and caused █ containment breaches as a result. \\n This event necessitated a mass-recall of all Foundation amnesiacs while a more effective tool was developed. In the intervening period, personnel were authorized to use Agent-PBR, Agent-1800, and Agent-MD20² to induce memory loss in civilian witnesses. \\n Attempts to discern how SCP-002-J gained knowledge of sensitive Foundation information were largely unsuccessful.

SCP-:3 infected individuals are to be contained in individual high-security humanoid containment cells at Site 3.

The entity may occasionally need to use the restroom, take breaks by walking the North Wing corridor, or receive water from the water fountain. In the long-term, the entity can be contained by biannual performance reviews indicating that we are pleased but think the entity is capable of more, and annual raises equivalent to rate of inflation, plus four percentage points. The entity may also be enticed to remain in containment by pointing out the low cost of living, easy commute and quality public parks. \\n Description: SCP-004-J is Stanley Nichols, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) (Univ. of Michigan, 1978) and former Chief Financial Officer for [REDACTED], currently employed by the Foundation. SCP-004-J is roughly 180cm tall and weighs roughly 75kg, Caucasian, with thinning brown hair and brown eyes. The entity has been in Foundation containment since July 1991, ostensibly in reply to a job posting. The anomalous properties of the entity manifested after the job was awarded, during mandatory psych and low-level amnestic administration. The staffer assigned to the task flatly refused to administer amnestics to the entity, claiming that SCP-004-J was \"a real visionary,\" and that \"[it] would be a waste of drugs, and a needless CapEx hit.\" After a brief convention by the hiring department, the Compulsion and Cognitohazard Unit, and Site-04\\'s subject matter expert on hazardous humanoids, the agreement was made to contain SCP-004-J under the premise of hiring them for the desired position in accounts payable. \\n SCP-004-J appears to be a very capable accountant and has made commendable efforts in both lowering our annual capital expenditures budget while streamlining our vendor and purchase process for operating expenditures. Furthermore, their holistic approach to purchasing and leveraging the growing internationalization of the supply chain has caused a sea change in our view of the synergistic possibilities to creating a budget-concious deliverable, leading to a paradigm-shift of crowd-sourced \\n It appears the entity was in my vicinity briefly. To summarize, SCP-004-J has a distinct cognitohazardous field that will interfere with thought processes, overriding thought patterns with new ones that encourage growing a business through a set of jargon commonly used by C-level executives (\"buzzwords\") while also impairing the ability to think critically. CT scans of foundation employees in the field of SCP-004-J show a lowered neuron excitement state in the occipital cortex and the hippocampus. SCP-004-J was classed as Euclid in August of 1991. \\n SCP-004-J was reclassed as Thaumiel in October of 1992 following a near-total containment breach in August of 1992 caused by structural damage suffered during Hurricane Andrew at Site-██, during which SCP-004-J was exposed to SCP-106, which is classed Keter and invariably hostile to human life. Rather than panic or hide, SCP-004-J began discussing the importance of residual income and annuities when structuring a quarterly budget. SCP-106 appeared rapt with attention, materialized a business card and agreed to join SCP-004-J for a \"lunch and learn\" at his soonest convenience. Further testing has shown that the cognitohazard surrounding SCP-004-J affects not only humanoids, but every sentient lifeform that has been exposed. \\n In furtherance of a hypothesis posed by Drs. McGinley and White, SCP-004-J was stationed outside the containment cell of SCP-682, at a safe distance but close enough to have the notorious creature in its cognitohazardous field.

Jr. Researcher R███ is to be kept on a diet including 700 grams of glucose in acceptable forms1 as well as 3000 miligrams of water daily. Two guards are to be stationed outside containment armed with steel tactical swords and boxing gloves. Agents stationed on all islands of Hawaii are to continue investigations into reports of abnormally large protea flowers. \\n Description: SCP-6K-J is a large red protea flower growing from the head of Jr. Researcher R███. SCP-6k-J was first discovered three weeks following Jr. Researcher R███’s return from a vacation in Hawaii, when a sprout began growing from his head. SCP-6k-J sprouted in full approximately 4 days later. The anomaly causes Jr. Researcher R███ no pain, but has a noticeable impact on both appetite and behavior. \\n Despite being genetically identifiable as a Hawaiian protea, SCP-6k-J has a minor cognitohazardous effect on certain individuals. This effect causes these individuals to visually perceive SCP-6k-J as a physical manifestation of the color pink, or sometimes white. Viewers who perceive this anomaly often report headaches or nosebleeds after the experience, as well as a mild craving for citrus. \\n SCP-6k-J is partially carnivorous and shows a preference toward human meat, but violent outbursts can be prevented if the anomaly is fed “unlimited candy,” as reported by Jr. Researcher R███. Should SCP-6k-J not be fed sufficient candy, Jr. Researcher R███ will attack and attempt to consume any human or living creature it can. This behavior has been described by witnesses as “mean” or \"scary.\" Tests have found that leaves and petals from SCP-6k-J are entirely bulletproof, and cannot be destroyed by any means, excluding sharp blades. Blunt force applied to the main bulb of the flower, primarily by punching or kicking, halts any aggressive behavior and renders SCP-6k-J dormant. \\n SCP-6k-J Initial Briefing\\nSCP-6k-J was initially studied and contained by MTF Tau-4\\'s (\"A Real Life Preschool Class\").

SCP-008-J resists containment by similar means. \\n Below is a list of SCP-008-J sightings. In all instances, Commander Price is the first staff member to encounter SCP-008-J. No evidence has been found to suggest that this isn’t just another coincidence. \\n Incident: 008/1 \\n Date: ██/██/████ \\n Description: SCP-008-J was hired for his expertise as an electrician, to repair the lights at Stephany’s Classy Posies, the florist which acts as a front for the ███████ Site. Due to a minor containment breach, the shop was unstaffed when SCP-008-J arrived.

Do you want me to have a look at your lights, or not? \\n Closing Statement: SCP-008-J was placed in the custody of Agent ████████ while the containment breach was suppressed, however, Agent ████████ suffered a fatal aneurism moments later, prompting SCP-008-J to return to Stephanie’s Classy Posies, call for an ambulance, and leave a note, instructing Commander Price to contact him when he is ready to have his lights repaired. \\n Incident: 008/2 \\n Date: ██/██/████ \\n Description: SCP-008-J is seen at the ██████ City Foundation carpentry front, Super Craftsmanship Protocols. After requesting to use the on-site lavatories, SCP-008-J mistook the directions given to him, and made his way through a door to the Site’s containment facility. The electronic lock had recently been destroyed by an agent of the Chaos Insurgency, who began hacking into the Foundation’s mainframe, moments after SCP-008-J’s arrival. \\n Transcript: \\n Commander Price: Alright people!

Anyone ever tell you that? Anyway, I mention the gents cause I’ve kinda gotta pee. Couldn’t be a pal and point me in the right direction, could you? \\n Closing Statement: While personally leading SCP-008-J to a containment cell, Commander Price was confronted by the Chaos Insurgency agent, and both were taken hostage, under the threat of detonating a handheld explosive. Once clear of the facility, the agent was extracted by car, leaving Commander Price to attempt to capture SCP-008-J at gunpoint, before being arrested by local authorities, allowing SCP-008-J’s escape. \\n Incident: 008/3 \\n Date: ██/██/████ \\n Description: SCP-████ began to show signs of awakening from its 2,000 years of hibernation. Because of his nautical combat experience, Commander Price is relocated to the ██████ Site, beneath the Atlantic Ocean, overlooking the fissure in which SCP-████ resides. The means by which SCP-008-J came to be at the site are unknown. \\n Transcript: \\n Commander Price: Alright people, it’s go time! I want suppressing fire on this thing NOW!

However, after the site suffered a blow from SCP-████, the escape pod malfunctioned and launched from the facility, failing to collide with 17 of SCP-████’s active tentacles, before progressing to open waters. \\n SCP-008-J was lost at sea and presumed dead, until two days later, when Commander Price received a Facebook friend request from SCP-008-J, along with a message, which read, “Sorry about the pod.
