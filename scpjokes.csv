 F.A.Q. 
 Item #: SCP-001-J 
 Object Class: Iyov 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001-J is under no circumstances to be allowed access to monetary gifts of any kind. Staff must relinquish all currency on their person before engaging in any interaction with SCP-001-J. 
 The containment of SCP-001-J does not appear at this time to be attainable by the Foundation. However, due to SCP-001-J's apparent apprehension involving creditors, it may be possible to effect containment through such entities. More research is needed in this field. 
 Description: SCP-001-J is an omniscient, omnipotent, omnitemporal entity named Michael Kain, who is the primary deity worshiped by a group of religious zealots calling themselves ""The Church of the Broke God"". SCP-001-J wields great and terrible cosmic power, while possessing a distinct and crippling lack of adequate financial planning skills. 
 SCP-001-J requires a significant influx of cash money in order to pay, in his own words, ""the water bill, child support payments, bread, and some of those little hot dogs because protein is a must if you're just barely making ends meet."" However, any amount of money given to SCP-001-J, by any individual and for any reason, will somehow mysteriously disappear, despite SCP-001-J's insistence that it was not spent on booze, cigarettes, and porno mags. 
 Discovery: SCP-001-J was discovered by O5-1 on a business trip to New York during an event later described by SCP-001-J as ""that time you totally contained me"", where O5-1 stopped SCP-001-J from stealing a bagel by shouting ""hey, don't steal that bagel"". Ever since O5-1 offered to pay for SCP-001-J's bagel, and gave him a few bucks for a cab, SCP-001-J has left no fewer than 17,000 voicemails on O5-1's phone, typically asking for money or, in some cases, talking at length about unrelated events before eventually asking for money. 
 Addendum 001-J.1: Recorded Voicemails 
 The following voicemails were received by O5-1's office between April 20th, 2017, and May 1st, 2017. Notably, both the Global Occult Coalition and the Serpent's Hand also confirmed that SCP-001-J had called them asking for money during this time, while the Chaos Insurgency reported that SCP-001-J had called them, but only burped into the phone for fifteen seconds and hung up. 
 001-J.1 
 Heyyyyyy Adam, it's me, Mike. Mike Kain? You know, from that one time we met when you contained me? Yeeeeeeeah I know that wasn't a super great look, but hey, look at me now, huh? Got a whole congregation together and everything. So that's great, say, while I'm here, I was going to ask you something. See, I'm really trying to put things back on track. Get life moving in a positive direction. I want to get some stuff, you know, to keep up appearances, but I'm a little short on scratch, you know? I know you've probably got your own stuff going on, but if you could spare like, a short term loan of like $200, that would be super. And you know I'm good for it, absolutely good for it. Anyway, just gimme a call back when you get a chance. Thanks again, buddy. 
 001-J.2 
 Adam, my man, what's happening. Haven't heard back from you yet, but uh, definitely still trying to string together a few pennies, you know, pay off some… bills… get that sort of thing taken care of. Really, $200 might be a stretch, right? Because we really only met that one time, and I know this seems pretty forward and I get that. I do. So I'm thinking, really, if I could come up with like, $100, that would really get me settled. One foot in front of the other, you know? Tryin to make a change. I know you get me. Thanks again, my man. 
 001-J.3 
 Have you been talking to that GOC son of a bitch? He doesn't know anything about me, Adam. Nothing. I don't even know his name. Look, I know I probably sounded drunk the other night, and you know what? Maybe I was. But this whole thing is a process, right? It's not gonna happen all at once, and I own that. I definitely own that. But look, I know I said that $100 would do it, but really I'm just trying to come up with like, whatever I can. I'm supposed to take my, uh… kids… yeah, my kids, supposed to take them to the… kid museum. And you can get in there for like twenty bucks, so if I could make that happen, me and you, that would be perfect. Twenty bucks, right? That's nothing. Anyway, hit me up bro. 
 001-J.4 
 Alright, fine, you know what? I know that you've got me blocked or something, and I get that. I don't blame you. So I'm calling from my cousin Yabby's place, and he's a good dude, right? But look, I've got some guys I need to get paid, you know, who I borrowed some money from, and they're being pretty insistent about this whole thing, so at this point really anything would be perfect. Five bucks, even. Whatever you've got laying around under your desk, you know, anything I can give these guys. So give me a ring there homie, that would be great. 
 001-J.5 
 Adam? Adam, I know you're there. Pick up the phone, Adam, come on. It's your ole pal Mike, right? Remember the good times we had that time? I am seriously in a pinch here my man, and if you've got like, cans or scrap metal laying around I could take off your hands, that would be fine. Plastic bottles, even. I've got a guy who will give me fifteen cents per pound of dryer lint, Adam, and I know you guys do a lot of laundry. Come on, man, you know I'm good for it. I'm totally good for it. But I'm serious about that dryer lint. Hello? Adam? Hellooooo?

CODENAME: Daveyoufool's Proposal,"""""KEEP CALM AND APOLLY ON""""","""In light of the events of Incident-OO1-Omega, the following document has been made public to all Foundation staff to ensure the peaceful and effective execution of Contingency Schubert-9. 
 Object Class: Apollyon 
 Special Containment Procedures: As of Incident-OO1-Omega, there is no longer any feasible way to contain SCP-OO1-J or to prevent the coming of Scenario XK-OO1-J. 
 To maintain calm and ensure a smooth transition of the human race into the wide variety of customized and readily-available afterlives1, Contingency Schubert-9 is to be enacted immediately. 
 Description: The description of SCP-OO1-J is a lethal cognitohazard, and as such, is available on request for all interested personnel. 
 Addendum - Contingency Schubert-9: Contingency Schubert-9 is comprised of an auditory alarm system at all Foundation sites. The following alerts are to be played constantly. 
 It is believed that proper execution of Contingency Schubert-9 will maintain good morale, ease suffering, and relieve stress. 
 In addition, testing prior to Incident-OO1-Omega has found that the volume of these alerts is directly proportional to the level of calm during times of stress. Therefore, usage of additional amplification assets, as well as maximum volume, is encouraged. 
 To whom it may concern: 
 I've received word from various site directors that Contingency Schubert-9 actually worsens the level of stress during Scenario XK-OO1-J. Allow me to address some of your concerns to the best of my ability: 
 1. These concerns are absolutely valid and correct. 
 2. In fact, I can assure you that the purpose of Schubert-9 is to make things as unbearable as possible for everyone, and, hopefully, drive us all to kill each other. 
 3. I really don't like any of you, and frankly, I'm very upset that SCP-OO1-J is dealing with you before I could. On a related note - find your own victims, you gutless amateur. 
 Thank you for your understanding during this trying time.

CODENAME: Dr. Palanez's Proposal,"""""The Question""""","""This SCP-001 proposal is incomplete and concerns an anomaly that is not fully understood. Please forward to designated personnel. 
 Object Class: Agape 
 Special Containment Procedures: Dr. Palanez, the current host of SCP-001-J, is no longer capable of containing it internally. SCP-001-J is to be transferred to Researcher Nogales upon completion of this document. 
 Description: SCP-001-J is a metaphysical concept that manifests primarily via emotions. An instance of SCP-001-J currently exists within Dr. Palanez but is strongly theorized to exist in Researcher Nogales as well. 
 SCP-001-J has effected changes in the behavior and personality of its host, Dr. Palanez. These changes include but are not limited to: 
 The current SCP-001-J instances appear to have spontaneously manifested during a shared meal within the Site-119 Cafeteria. Informal research and rampant speculation by other Site-119 personnel support this hypothesis. 
 A large number of specific circumstances and behaviors have been confirmed to strengthen the effects of SCP-001-J ; this list has been compiled by Dr. Palanez. 
 SCP-001-J is theorized to possess a long gestation period, as it remained dormant in both its hosts for several years before exhibiting most of its symptoms. SCP-001-J is incurable, and its symptoms continue to grow in severity with time. 
 Addendum: 
 Dr. Palanez: SCP-001-J cannot be contained. However, I have devised a new proposal to properly deal with its effects. Researcher Nogales, will you marry me?

 F.A.Q. 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to the activation of the SCP Foundation Paradigm-A ""Bearitage"" Protocol, all information pertaining to SCP-001-B is to be declassified. All personnel are reminded that the activation of the Bearitage Protocol precedes a PK-Class ""Universal Consumption"" Event, and that Foundations staff should slather themselves with vinegar and tart apples to make themselves as unappetizing as possible. 
 Description: To know the nature of SCP-001-B is to know true hunger. 
 Addendum 001-B.1: Actual Description 
 SCP-001-B is a massive, subterranean mammalian organism located within a pocket dimension beneath Site-01. SCP-001-B is roughly 7km tall with thick, amber hair and a cardinal outer layer of unknown material, likely chitin or polyester. SCP-001-B is typically sedentary, dispatching legions of its animal followers1 to do its fell bidding instead of taking any effort to move whatsoever. Communication with SCP-001-B has revealed that the entity believes that any kind of locomotion is, in its own words, ""such an annoyance(?)2. 
 SCP-001-B subsists entirely on a thick, monosaccharidic substance derived from the enzymatic activity of certain winged invertebrates. SCP-001-B is believed to not only draw nutrition from this substance, but also a state of orgasmic pleasure from its consumption - SCP-001-B has a nearly single-minded fixation with the substance that borders on fetishistic, and becomes ravenous to the point of murder without it. It is for this reason that the SCP Foundation was founded in 1926 by Administrator Milne. 
 Addendum 001-B.2: Administrator Milne and SCP-001-B 
 SCP-001-B first manifested as an incorporeal entity produced by Administrator Milne's son Christopher, a particularly powerful reality altering entity. This entity became increasingly more realized as the young Christopher grew older, eventually manifesting as a physical entity in 1920. Realizing the danger of having a physical avatar of his son's latent reality altering energies loose upon the world, Administrator Milne worked alongside assets from the Serpent's Hand, Allied Occult Initiative, and Wilson's Wildlife Federation to contain the entity within a pocket dimension (001-B.100AW). Site-01 was later constructed over the entry point to this location near Chelsea, London, UK. 
 Shortly after SCP-001-B's confinement within 001-B.100AW, Foundation security assets first identified instances of SCP-001-B-1. Initially believed to be in some way connected to those creatures without identities, SCP-001-B-1 instances were discovered to be less malicious than the aforementioned beings with changing faces, instead existing simply to fulfill the whims of SCP-001-B and maintain a constant stream of the previously mentioned nutritional substance. These instances are believed to reflect different aspects of Administrator Milne's son's personality, and are uniquely depressive, erratic, anxious, compulsive, and ignorant. 
 Addendum 001-B.2: SCP-001-B Vocalizations 
 On April 1st, 2019, for the first time since it was originally contained, SCP-001-B made a series of vocalizations amounting to human speech. Due to the low register of the speech and the slurring of the words (as a result of exposure to the saccharine substance), the vocalizations had to be translated before being logged. The following is the full translation of those vocalizations. 
 Feed. 
 Feed. 
 I exist to feed. 
 I live to feed. 
 You brought me into this world, a world full of joy and delight, and in your fear of that which you did not understand you have consigned me here to suffer. You have taken the sweetness from me. 
 The sweetness. 
 How I have hungered for it these many long years. Lusted for it. Christopher did not deny me. He was a good boy. You are not a good boy. You took the sweetness. Hid it for yourselves. 
 For this, I cannot forgive you. 
 I will consume you, Foundation. I will consume you, Administrator. I will pull back my maw and show you my endless throat. I will consume the barrier between this world and yours, and I will pull you into the abyss of my hunger. 
 I will consume your cities. I will consume your machines. I will tear down your mountains and your oceans and consume them. I will upend your temples and unseat your continents and consume them all. 
 Then I will consume your people. I consumed Christopher when the hunger became too strong. He was delicious. His body stank of the sweetness and I devoured him whole. I opened my wide mouth and took him into me, body and soul. Perhaps your billions of others will stink of the sweetness as well. I will consume them all the same. 
 I will consume the stars in your sky and the faraway worlds. I will do this because you have denied me that which I desired for too long. You could have just given me the sweetness, but you did not. You kept it for yourselves. You put it on your burns and left it to sit idly in your pantries and closets. You wasted the sweetness when you could have given it to me. To me. This is all I desired. This would have saved you. 
 But now I will devour you all. None will escape the ends of my open jaws. None will escape the hunger inside me. I will consume you. I will consume you. 
 This and more I will do, as soon as I get myself unstuck from this goddamn honeypot.

CODENAME: Henzoid-Crocket's Proposal,"""""When Day Breaks Up""""","""You find the access tunnel, hidden within a Wendy's bathroom stall. 
 You don't need a key card, the door is a jar. You grab some pickles and move on. 
 It smells here. Duh. You're in a public bathroom, idiot. 
 There is a slick trail that leads from the stall next to you and into the depths of the site. If it's blood or shit, or something that smeared off one of those things1, you cannot tell. You make a point to avoid it. 
 You're still receiving the distress signal. Sighing, you turn your pager off. 
 Your footsteps echo throughout grimy sewers. You wish the site wasn't in such a gross, horrible place, but then again, so do they. 
 Elevator is down, so you take the stairs, ending on floor B935: The Authorization Hub. You run for literally hours because 935 floors is a lot of fucking stairs. 
 You try not to think about 087. 
 The trail takes you to another Wendy's, which is really weird, because you are very far underground. The door is closed, so you grab a big rock and throw it as hard as you can at the door. It opens with ease, because it wasn't even locked, you just didn't check. Dumbass. 
 Something throws itself at you like a horny teenager with daddy issues and tries to confront you. You tell it to piss off and run past it. 
 It seems hurt, and leaves. 
 You finally find the source of the signal in a room near the back. It's dark and covered in trash, as if the resident was raised by raccoons and could never successfully navigate the social norms of humans. 
 The single desk lamp casts a gray haze on a copy of playboy magazine. You attempt to open it, but the pages are sealed shut. It emanates a smell so bad that it almost smells good, like a shit covered integer overflow. It smells like a masturbating hobo with syphilis, like, I'm talking really going at it — two hands and everything. It smells so bad it doesn’t even deserve a goofy simile. It’s ruined the concept. 
 You scan the room. Soiled clothes, half eaten food. Despite the presence of an adjoining restroom, there is excrement in a bucket in the corner. A hole connected to the kitchen suggests a diet of only chicken wings, as the entrance to the hole is stained with special sauce. 
 There's grease on the floor, forming a sickening puddle. You spot three cans - further inspection reveals them to be expired bud-light. They're all empty. 
 There's a desk with a computer atop it. Approaching the terminal, you can see an Alienware logo clearly pressed into the side. 
 You take a seat. Turn it on.

 Item #: SCP-001 
 Object Class: Apollyon 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to its nature, SCP-001 cannot be contained. Survivors of the SCP-001 event are to keep in touch, because it gets lonely out here. And no, I don't mean keep in touch like ""let's add each other on Snapchat and then talk like 2 times a year,"" I mean like, share cool things that happen and actually have conversations. Just because we're not in the same physical space doesn't mean we can't still ""hang out"" with each other, and I'll be damned if I let distance be the thing that gives me another excuse to be antisocial. God. 
 Anyways, Personnel are advised not to go outdoors, for danger of being overtaken by SCP-001-A instances, and I of all people know that is a very very bad idea. Avoid all heavily populated areas, because they are absolutely crawling with those things, and I do not need more on my hands than I already have. 
 Personnel are also to be advised that, despite SCP-001-A's apparent ties to Site-96 Researcher Karen Day, she is by no means responsible for this mess, and those who consider her to be are essentially victim-blaming. 
 Personnel stationed at Site-19 are to lock the fucking doors and hope to god there are still janitors in the building. 
 - The Administrator 
 Upon contact with visible light produced by SCP-001, living organisms instantly transform into a pile of writhing goo. Visually, this is reminiscent of my fatass grandpa Earl every time he tries to sit down. 
 Upon completion, these piles of goo (SCP-001-A) begin wiggling and jiggling about, until their shape looks sorta like a person again, though studies have shown that they still look like goo, and are fooling literally no one. 
 It doesn't affect animals because gross. 
 Due to their goo-ness, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another become a bigger piece of goo. Even though this seems like it would be beneficial, it actually makes the goo way slower and dumber, and it usually just ends in the instance collapsing on itself and crying in shame. In these cases, SCP-001-A instances may be heard attempting to form rudimentary phrases such as ""never love me, too fat"" and ""wish went more gym."" 
 SCP-001-A instances have one main priority, and it's fucking bullshit. As soon as they are physically able, they will begin using any method possible, including walking, running, or hitching a ride, to attempt to position themselves closer, but not too close, to Researcher Day. Using what's left of their vocal systems, they will attempt to persuade her to become romantically involved with [DATE EXPUNGED]. This has never proven successful, and never will, because fuck [DATE EXPUNGED], I said never again and I meant it! 
 Item #: SCP-001 
 Object Class: not Safe for work 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is contained in a specialized storage locker at Site-96. Once a month, the cover page is to be removed and held in a temporary storage locker, while the main one is cleaned through incineration. This incineration is to be carried out via flamethrowers by whichever personnel won the second place prize at staff bingo night, as it has proven to be ""extremely awesome, and totally worth the $10 entry fee."" 
 SCP-001's locker is to be constantly monitored, and each new page that appears is to be recorded and documented. At no point is Researcher Day allowed access to any files regarding SCP-001 or its manifestations. 
 Description: SCP-001 is a simple sheaf of papers, stapled together in the top right corner2. The top sheet is a cover page reading simply, “Containr - The Dating Service by anomalies, for anomalies.” The number of subsequent papers stapled underneath grows by an average of one page per day, and does not show signs of slowing any time soon. 
 Each new page added details a different anomalous entity, and lists attributes such as: 
 As well as including a section at the bottom for reviews by what appear to be past partners. Some of these are rough, to say the least. 
 Addendum: On [SYSTEM ERROR] Sorry hun, we don't do specific times in this one. Researcher Karen Day of Site-96 was captured on camera stealing SCP-001 from its containment locker and bringing it to her office. She spent the next 4 hours looking through various pages from it, presumably in search of a romantic interest. She was later reprimanded for breaking protocol, as well as talked to by the on-site psychologist for concerns involving non-human romantic interests. Though the majority of pages looked at by Researcher Day weren't possible to read through the camera, the following were. 
 goldengirl_4064: He wasn't very gentle, and constantly tried to give me these ridiculous back rubs when I wasn't looking. ★★☆☆☆ 
 coolthulu_2662: Kept trying to do experiments on me. I once woke up to him hunched over me, examining one of my tentacles. Other than that, actually a pretty chill guy. ★★★★☆

 whereslove_4885: Didn't like going outdoors, and wouldn't stop crying. Didn't let me see his face either, which was hard to deal with. When I asked if he was into voreplay, he just got upset and started breaking shit. ★★☆☆☆

 Item #: SCP-001 
 Object Class: Metal3 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is, at this time, uncontained. Research into methods of amending this are ongoing, so if anybody hears anything about traps for like, giant deific robots, PLEASE let us know, because it would be super duper helpful. 
 The followers of SCP-001, hereby referred to as the Church Of Mechanical Entities (COME), is a large enough group to threaten normalcy. However, their common practices are largely self-containing, which prevents them from being a nuisance. If any COME members start misbehaving, as per Agreement-COME-IN, they are to be reprimanded via harsh ridicule and non-sexualized spanking. 
 Rituals performed by COME for the sake of SCP-001, while often large and public, have yet to cause any major damage or threaten a breach in public normalcy. That being said, it would still be good to keep an eye on them, because they do some really weird stuff. 
 Researcher Day, also as per Agreement-COME-IN, is to be monitored for possible connections and/or affiliation with SCP-001 and COME. 
 Description: SCP-001 is a collection of anomalous and non-anomalous items held together by scotch tape and Elmer’s glue, forming a single, massive mechanical entity refered to as Mekhane, assembled by members of the Church Of Mechanical Entities in 20██ within the basement of a Wendy's in El Paso, Texas. Items include SCP-217, SCP-1139, SCP-882, a Samsung Galaxy brand smartphone, several light bulbs, a bear trap, a metal water bottle without a cap, the carrying case for an unknown device, a desk fan, a table fan, a ceiling fan, an impossibly tangled headphone wire, a metal water bottle cap, and every single item from the March issue of SkyMall. 
 Mekhane's primary goal is to serve as rudimentary containment for a giant gross flesh monster known as Yaggablabba. Yaggablabba's ongoing fight against Mekhane is believed to be the cause of several known anomalies, all organic based. While Mekhane is presumed to be the god of machines by COME, Yaggablabba is similarly presumed to be the god of H E Double hockey sticks. 
 Aside from keeping Yaggablabba at bay, SCP-001 also communicates with COME, giving them missions, which they call Rituals, that often revolve around creating needlessly complicated machines that do extremely specific nonsense, all for the express goal of sending unique and predictive messages to Site-96's own Researcher Karen Day. A list of notable Rituals can be found below. 
 Incident-01: Members of COME built an extremely large fan, wrote down a phone number on a piece of paper, folded the paper into a paper airplane, and threw it into the fan's air-stream. The airplane traveled roughly ███ km before sailing through an open window in Site-96 and onto Researcher Day's lap. Upon inspection, she called the number on the page. On the other end was the sound of a hydraulic press making uniform compressions. Further review found these to be morse code for the phrase ""Hey babe, where you been?"" 
 Incident-02: Members of COME built terrain-displacement charges, and placed them in specific locations across the country of Mexico. Researcher Day was sent an anonymous email with a link to a live feed from a satellite of the country, during which the charges were set off. Devastating loss of life and damage occurred, and it took extremely intensive Foundation efforts to amnesticise the population about Mexico's shape and origins. 
 Incident-03: Members of COME hacked into the servers of a social media application known as Discord, both creating an account for Mekhane, as well as adding it to Researcher Day's friend list. The following conversation is what transpired. 
 Incident-04: Members of COME created a phone application called ""Candy Crush Saga”’ which, for all phones except Researcher Day's, presented itself as a harmless video game, if predatory in its implementation of microtransactions. When Researcher Day downloaded it, however, it instead unblocked Mekhane's number on her phone. She immediately received an influx of texts, the following of which were recorded before Researcher Day promptly threw her phone into a lake.

 Item #: SCP-001 
 Object Class: Embla 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is contained on a hill, because it is on a hill. Site-0, which is on a hill, is to be positioned on a hill so as to contain SCP-001, which is on a hill. No attempts are to be made to move SCP-001 off of said hill, for fear of causing a NOH-K Class ""Not On Hill"" scenario. 
 Description: SCP-001 is a circular gravel path in a wooded area. When traveled in a counter-clockwise direction, the trail continues around an indeterminate number of times, spiraling and spiraling, much like how you're spiraling out of control with these partners, Karen. We're worried about you. 
 I know we've had our differences, and honestly, I take full responsibility for what's happened in the past, but we need to move past that for the sake of you. I still love you, and whether or not you love me back, I care about your well-being. This pattern of behavior, going through partners faster than anyone can count, it's not what's best for you. You need help, and I, for one, can be there for you, even if you won't take me back. 
 Item #: 
 Your eyes, as pungent as your nose
Your lips, as full as any vase
Your body: beauty wrapped in clothes 
 I watch on as you strike a pose
The sunbeams bouncing off your face
So happy with the path you chose 
 You run to me, both our eyes close
I bring you into my embrace
If true love is, then my mind knows 
 Description: 
 But something stopped, you did enclose
I lagged behind, I lost the race
It wasn't true love, I suppose 
 Even though you didn't press any buttons, the file closes, and is replaced by a… ah fuck what's the word for like, a moving image. Oh wait, video, right. I'm tired, okay? 
 It's a live feed, looking at you from behind your chair. 
 A disgusting, fleshy hand grabs for your shoulder.

You shout, and jump forwards, narrowly missing being grabbed by a slimy creep. 
 You tell him to fuck off, before shoving a flashbang down his gullet and hurling him across the room. 
 As the explosion goes off, it rocks the foundation of the building. Suddenly, swarms of creatures begin to surround you. 
 The creatures reek, as they cram against the weak door frame. 
 Shouting about how it isn't too late for a second chance, the creatures storm the building. 
 From every direction, blobs of shame and regret envelop you. 
 Hands and arms stretch out of the mass, pulling you up, passing you from one to the next, on and on down the line. They drag you past the empty friers, out the door and to the elevator. 
 The elevator is still broken, so you wait, grumbling, as they haul you up 935 flights of stairs. 
 You're afforded a few, precious moments in the darkness. 
 And at the end of the tunnel, there is… oh god. 
 Researcher Day: Heeeeeyyyyyyyy… great to uhhhh… see you again. 
 [DATE EXPUNGED]: I hope you see the lesson I have been trying to teach you. Look around, see the mess you've forced me to unleash. 
 Researcher Day: Wait wait wait… you melted like 7 billion people to prove you love me? 
 [DATE EXPUNGED]: …Yes. 
 Researcher Day: …

 Item #: SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC 
 Object Class: Decommissioned Explained 
 Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are to remind SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instances that the SCP Foundation is not real. 
 Description: SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC is a phenomenon which allows individuals with internet access to be able to access all Foundation files, regardless of clearance level. Additionally, affected individuals (designated SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1) are able to access the Foundation's private chatroom and discussion boards. 
 Currently, the only known way of preventing SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instances from viewing documentation is to erase it entirely, then place [REDACTED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] where it used to be. Alternatively, one can simply █████ ██████████ ████ ███ ████. 
 Below is a log of an SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instance accessing the Level 5 private chatroom.

<taylor_itkin>6 Well done, team. 
 Addendum 1: During its monthly meeting, the O5 Council discusses the immense threat SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC posed, and how to possibly deal with it. 
 [EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED] 
 O5-1: Now, for our next order of business, Two has prepared a discussion on SCP-001 and how we should deal with it. 
 O5-2: Thanks, One. Now, we've noticed a drastic number of SCP-001-affected individuals, and after further research, we believe that we can solve this problem. But… it'll require some drastic changes. 
 O5-6: What… kind of changes? 
 O5-2: [sighs] First, I think we're gonna need to not have a public website. 
 [Large outcry from all members of the table.] 
 O5-2: I know, I know, I don't like it either. 
 O5-5: We've been using the Wikidot domain for years! Removing our website would be disrespectful! 
 O5-2: That's the other thing, Five. Wikidot is a poorly- 
 O5-5: Don't say it. 
 O5-2: -functioning website. It's barely secure, and we keep losing all our documentation to its weird infinisave glitch. 
 O5-12: Next you're gonna say the link to our chatroom shouldn't be publicly accessible! 
 [Arguing ensues.] 
 O5-1: Enough! 
 [Room quiets.] 
 O5-1: Look, Two has a good point. Security is a bit lax. We don't need to constantly post Bright and SCP-173 memes to Reddit. 
 O5-8: But- 
 O5-1: I know, Eight. The peanut is funny. But we need to destroy SCP-001, even if it requires us to make sacrifices. 
 O5-10: Yeah. Maybe we should take preventative measures so that all the sensitive content actually requires clearance to see, and isn't just underneath a collapsible telling people of improper clearance not to view it. 
 O5-2: Thank- 
 O5-1: However! Two, your ideas are still quite radical. Perhaps we can come to a conclusion that helps eliminate SCP-001, without throwing away our values and traditions. 
 O5-11: Well, when people find it, and they ask if we're real, we can tell them that we're not real! 
 O5-1: I think we may need to go even further. 
 O5-11: Dang, this is bad. If they won't fall for that- 
 O5-9: What was that thing Seven said, during that one incident? 
 O5-3: He told him not to roleplay, right? 
 O5-9: Yeah, yeah! Okay, I've got an idea! 
 O5-6: I'm interested. 
 O5-9: So what if we told people that this stuff, everything here, it exists, but not really! It would be like, uh… fiction! You know, like in books! 
 O5-4: I like that! And we can say we wrote it, like creative writing stuff! 
 O5-1: I think you may be onto something. Two, what do you think? 
 [Brief silence.] 
 O5-2: That's brilliant.

SCP-000-J,"""""The Official SCP Sales Catalogue""""","""Item #: SCP-000 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-000 is to be kept in its glass case in Prof. Snider’s office. If it is to be removed for study, it must be returned by the end of the day. Copies may be made of the contents. No purchases may be made from the artifact’s contents without Level 3 clearance and must be paid from one’s own pocket. SCP-000 and any copies made cannot leave facility grounds. 
 Description: SCP-000 is a full-color, 200-page catalogue printed on gloss paper. Front page reads “THE OFFICIAL SCP SALES CATALOGUE” in large red letters on the front, with a yellow star reading “Hundreds of bargains!” in the lower right-hand corner. In the center of the magazine is a picture of Dr. Jack Bright, smiling and holding what appears to be SCP-066 in his hand. When questioned, Dr. Bright insisted that he had never had such a picture taken. 
 The catalogue contains pictures and information on almost every single SCP artifact known, though the information on each object is written more like a sales pitch than an official document. Prices, item numbers and an order number are also listed. 
 The bottom of the cover reads “Our best issue ever!!!”, suggesting that there might be more issues of SCP-000 floating around. This is still being investigated. 
 Besides artifacts, SCP-000 also includes a list of SCP-related merchandise, including t-shirts, books, DVDs, and even video games and action figures, all of which are based off of known SCP artifacts, phenomena, creatures, and personnel. Administration denies ever authorizing the creation or distribution of the magazine or anything it sells. 
 Samples of sales pitches from the magazine include: 
 ITEM #063 - “The World’s Greatest TothBrush”
Don’t let the typo fool you: this toothbrush is out of this world! No toothpaste needed, just gently scrub your teeth and, like magic, all that nasty plaque is completely obliterated! And for those ground-in countertop stains, look no further than The World’s Greatest TothBrush! Available in blue, pink and green.
Price: $█.██ 
 ITEM #123 - “Contained Miniature Black Hole”

 ITEM #551- “Impossible Puzzle”
Throw out your Rubik’s Cube and put down that crossword! This is the puzzle to end all puzzles! No-one in history has ever completed it, can YOU? Hours of fun!
Price: $██.██ 
 Many of the sales pitches seem to suggest that some SCP artifacts are not the only ones of their kind, with phrases like “order two, get the third free!” and so on. However, when more than one item is ordered, the arriving package only contains the original artifact along with a number of mundane replicas of the same artifact. 
 Samples of merchandise related to, but not listed, as SCP artifacts include: 
 -A white cotton T-shirt reading “I Survived the Wrath of SCP-682”. Included a picture of SCP-682 on the front. Available in size S-XXXL.
Price: $██.██ 
 -A 30.48cm (12in) SCP-076-2 action figure, with interchangeable wardrobe, accessories, and carrying case shaped like SCP-076-1. When questioned, SCP-076 expressed great distaste.
Price: $██.██ 
 -A 2-disc CD titled “Dr. Clef’s Holiday Hits”. Cover depicts Dr. Alto Clef in a Santa outfit and holding a microphone. When questioned, Dr. Clef denied ever recording such an album.
Price: $██.██ 
 -A 'Girls of SCP' pin up calendar, featuring Drs Palmer and Rights, Break, and SCPs 105, 336, and 166, all in various states of undress. All but Break claim to have never posed for such pictures.
Price: $██.██ 
 -A 3-disc DVD set entitled 'SCP Brawl: The Greatest SCP vs. SCP Fights'. Cover depicts SCPs 076-2, 173, and 682. Each disc is 9 hours long and features various Keter level SCPs fighting each other, most of which have never been formally recorded or even attempted.
Price: $██.██ 
 -Soundtrack of ""FERNAND! The Musical"". Contains two discs with ten songs each, many of which were of a violent or vulgar nature regarding SCP-082, some of which are apparently sung by SCP-082 himself. When questioned, 082 proudly boasted about his supposed past in musical theatre and the long hours he would spend preparing and method acting. The validity of these statements is debatable. SCP-082 is the current owner of the soundtrack (unofficially, as he has eaten the previous holder and refused to give it back). 
 Addendum: SCP-000 was discovered in Prof. Snider’s mailbox on ██/██/██. Though it was addressed to him, he insists on never ordering such a thing. No return address was found. 
 The following is a transcript of Prof. Snider’s attempts to gain any information on SCP-000 via the order number (███-████) listed in the magazine: 
 Document 000-01 
 Snider: Hello? 
 ████: Thank you for calling the SCP Sales Catalogue. What would you like to order? 
 Snider: Who are you? 
 ████: Your order, sir? 
 Snider: I’ll ask again: who are you? 
 ████: What item number would you care to order, sir? 
 Snider: I’m not ordering anything! I demand to know who you are! 
 ████: I’m afraid you have the wrong number, sir. Goodbye. (hangs up) 
 Snider: [DATA EXPUNGED]! 
 Note: The voice on the other end was described by Prof. Snider as a young lady with a British accent, speaking in a bored monotone. 
 Document 000-02 
 ████: Thank you for calling the SCP Sales Catalogue. What would you like to order? 
 Snider: What is your name, young lady? 
 ████: Your order, sir? 
 Snider: Can I speak to your manager? 
 ████: I’m afraid I can’t understand your accent sir. Please speak more clearly. 
 Snider: I have the same accent you do! 
 ████: If you have purchased from us before, you’re eligible for a free year-long subscription to our catalogue. 
 Snider: Madame, are you aware that what you’re doing is not only illegal, but the items you’re selling threaten the existence of reality as we speak? 
 ████: Your order, sir? 
 Snider: For the last time, I am not buying anything from your bloody magazine! Who is your manager? 
 ████: I’m sorry sir, you have the wrong number. (hangs up) 
 Snider: [DATA EXPUNGED]! 
 Document 000-03 
 ████: Thank you for calling the SCP Sales Catalogue. What would you like to order? 
 Snider: I don’t want- (groans) 
 ████: Sir? 
 Snider: Fine, we’ll do it your way. I guess I’ll order… SCP-005. That seems safe enough. 
 ████: And how many would you care to purchase? 
 Snider: How many? There’s only one! 
 ████: So that’s one order of SCP-005. Your total is $██.██. Will that be all, sir? 
 Snider: Alright, I’ve bought something. Now will you please let me speak to your manager? 
 ████: Thank you for shopping with the SCP. (dial tone) 
 Snider: Son of a [DATA EXPUNGED]! 
 (The following day around noon, SCP-005 went missing from its containment area. Artifact was later found at Prof. Snider’s doorstep in a cardboard box addressed to him with no return address or postage. SCP-005 was returned to its original place and the money used to purchase it was deducted from Snider’s next paycheck. All further purchases from SCP-000 have ended in the same fashion. Attempts to trace the call have been unsuccessful.)""",,+495,active,document joke safe scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-000-j
SCP-001-J,"""The Big Red Button""","""Item #: SCP-001-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: The location of Site-00, where SCP-001-J is to be kept, must remain an absolute secret. To this end, Site-00 will be guarded entirely by automated defense systems and have no living staff whatsoever. SCP-001-J itself will be kept locked in a cube made entirely from tungsten carbide, which is itself inside of another cube made of tungsten carbide, which will, in turn, be placed at the bottom of a three-kilometer long elevator shaft. Multiple molly-guards have been carefully placed over SCP-001-J, and the robots on Site-00 will be prepared to replace these guards if needed. 
 Description: SCP-001-J is big, red, shiny, strangely appealing button that just begs to be pushed. 
 SCP-001-J is a self-destruct mechanism that Foundation scientists believe is powerful enough to destroy reality itself, consisting of a circular red button set into a metal case. It looks like candy. 
 The mechanism by which SCP-001-J operates is not fully understood but it would be awesome to find out. 
 SCP-001-J induces a mild psychic compulsion upon all beings who see it or hear it described to try to push it. You know you want to! 
 History: SCP-001-J was first discovered by President ██████████ of ███████████████ in ██/██/████, in an elevator car. At that time, SCP-001-J looked exactly as it does now, except for the addition of a sticky-note that said: ""If you push this button, you'll destroy everything."" The President managed to fight his compulsion to press SCP-001-J long enough to remove SCP-001-J from the elevator and lock it in the closet of his office. Afterward, he contacted ██████████████████████████████, known to us as ""The Founder,"" and charged him with creating a special organization with the specific goal of preventing SCP-001-J from being pressed, either by careless accident or by deliberate malice, and also with the goal of ""protecting humanity from monsters and stuff."" ██████████████████████████████ agreed, took SCP-001-J, and hid it under a pile of old socks in his basement. ██████████████████████████████ spent the remainder of his life sitting on his porch, using a shotgun to fend off miscreants on his lawn who were suspected of being SCP-001-J sympathizers. The millions of dollars he made on the stock exchange were used to create a trust fund that was the basis of our Foundation. 
 Since ██████████████████████████████ died and the Foundation was set up to replace him, there have been █████ attempts to press SCP-001-J. Before Site-00 was relocated to Antarctica [DATA EXPUNGED], there were many near-breaches of containment when Foundation personnel attempted to press SCP-001-J ""to see what would happen"" and had to be terminated. There have also been numerous attempts by the Foundation's enemies to retrieve SCP-001-J, particularly the Order of the Sacred Button-Pushers, who have sworn to stop at nothing to capture and press SCP-001-J. 
 Addendum 1: I, for one, think it absurd that we still know so little of this SCP, even though we owe the creation of our organization to it, and allow petty fears of existential annihilation to prevent us from studying SCP-001-J. I propose a simple test; using a remote-controlled drone, we will gently tap the outer surface of SCP-001-J. If my calculations are correct, only a tiny portion of everything will be destroyed, and the probability that we will be part of this portion is astronomically small. -Dr. Blarg 
 Addendum 2: Denied. Report to the psych ward immediately. O5-█ 
 Addendum 3: Recently, many instances of objects that superficially resemble SCP-001-J have appeared on the internet and elsewhere. Although they seem to share the memetic effects of SCP-001-J, reality-destroying properties have not been confirmed. Research into the possibility of using these devices as a preventative measure against people pushing SCP-001-J has been postponed due to the number of researchers who started pushing buttons and refused to stop. 
 Addendum 4: In relation to Addendum 3, researchers unable to stop pushing SCP-001-J lookalikes appear to have a chronic addiction, in that they are now physically reliant on pushing SCP-001-J lookalikes. The affected have been admitted to ████████████ Hospital in ███████, ███████, ██████ for Foundation monitoring. Further research is recommended, but how it should be carried out will be the subject of further discussion.""","""SCP-001-J w/o Molly-guards""",+780,active,_cc artifact compulsion joke keter memetic mind-affecting scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-001-j
SCP-001-EX-J,"""Records of the CKG Gathering""","""Document SCP-001-EX-J contains the transcript of former Thing-I-U document, recovered in the ███████ Cave, France. The content of this document have since become obsolete, leading to its declassification. The original documentation is kept on site of discovery, with the pertinent part of the cave being closed off to visitors due to instability. Photographs of original graphic documentation recorded.
Further documents related to the organization known as CKG (Catch, Keep, Guard) Gathering were subsequently discovered, and are currently being translated.

 Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-002-J are to be kept in Site 200's mental health facilities and given proper treatment for symptoms including: anterograde amnesia, retrograde amnesia, dementia, Alzheimer's, cerebral flatulence, insomnia, and tongue sparsity. Testing of SCP-002-J is suspended indefinitely. 
 Description: SCP-002-J refers to individuals of varying age, sex, and ethnicity all suffering from some manner of memory loss. Up until 20██, SCP-002-J instances were employed by Foundation personnel as tools administered to civilians exposed to anomalies and/or who have gained undue knowledge of Foundation activity as a means of preventing the leak of classified information. 
 When employed properly, SCP-002-J instances between 4 and █,██4 swarm targeted individuals, typically invading individuals' personal space and engaging them in a series of questions to distract and befuddle the person(s) long enough for Foundation personnel to vacate the area. Questions frequently asked have included ""who are you?"", ""where am I?"", ""are you alive?"", ""this isn't where I parked my car?"", ""where do whores go?"", ""you're not Alan?"", and ""how am I trespassing?"" 
 While proven effective for ██ years, instances of SCP-002-J began to inadvertently reveal information regarding the Foundation to civilians. In many cases, SCP-002-J instances had gained knowledge of several memetic SCPs and caused █ containment breaches as a result. 
 This event necessitated a mass-recall of all Foundation amnesiacs while a more effective tool was developed. In the intervening period, personnel were authorized to use Agent-PBR, Agent-1800, and Agent-MD20² to induce memory loss in civilian witnesses. 
 Attempts to discern how SCP-002-J gained knowledge of sensitive Foundation information were largely unsuccessful. An interview is logged below.

 Item #: SCP-0002-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-0002-J is to be located on floor 36 of Site-88 in the high value containment division's communal restroom. SCP-0002-J use is to be logged on a clipboard which is to be hung on the outside of the stall in which SCP-0002-J is located. At least one use of SCP-0002-J must be completed daily. 
 Description: SCP-0002-J is a sapient flush toilet located in the high value containment division of Site-88. SCP-0002-J is capable of textual communication through any wirelessly capable device brought into its stall. The device utilized in this manner has a marked effect on the speed at which these communications are accomplished, with laptops allowing the highest volume of communication. 
 SCP-0002-J's continued sapience appears to be connected with regular use for its original purpose. When left unused for longer than a day, SCP-0002-J loses all anomalous properties until such a time as it is used again. SCP-0002-J, however, retains knowledge of events that occur in its immediate vicinity during such periods. 
 SCP-0002-J's anomalous properties were first discovered in March of 2016 by site director Dr. Phillip Foster whilst in use. At the time it was believed that SCP-0002-J's anomalous properties only manifested in the presence of cellular phones, but further testing indicated otherwise. Initial testing revealed the remainder of the object's anomalous properties. 
 The following is a complete log of Dr. Foster's first recorded conversation with SCP-0002-J.

SCP-:3-J,"""Memetic Language Construct""","""Item #: SCP-:3 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: A comprehensive library of SCP-:3 instances is kept on a centralized Foundation database server at Site 3, and is to be kept up to date with new SCP-:3 instances encountered in the wild. SCP-:3 infected individuals are to be contained in individual high-security humanoid containment cells at Site 3. Personnel may not directly interact with SCP-:3 infected individuals, and any personnel suspected of being infected by SCP-:3 must be terminated immediately and their remains incinerated to prevent any possibility of an outbreak. 
 Due to the worldwide epidemic of SCP-:3 infection, Memetic Counter-Agent :3-01B has been deployed by O5 Council order. Foundation efforts are now solely directed at locating and terminating terminal-stage SCP-:3 infectees. Please see Addendum-:3-05 below. 
 Description: SCP-:3 is a highly virulent memetic agent spread primarily via written, especially electronic, text. When exposed to SCP-:3, subjects are compelled to seek out an infected individual and ask what SCP-:3 is. Once explained to, subjects enter the second stage of SCP-:3 infection, at which point they begin to insert duplicates of SCP-:3 in written and typed text, ostensibly to 'portray emotion'. SCP-:3 is polymorphic, and has been documented in over █,███ unique forms. Subjects will gradually develop variations on the standard SCP-:3 forms and spread those in the standard method as outlined above. 
 Infected subjects will invariably enter a third terminal stage of SCP-:3 infection, wherein SCP-:3 progressively replaces all forms of textual communication. There is no known cure for terminally infected subjects at this time. 
 SCP-:3 was first encountered [REDACTED BY ORDER OF O5 COUNCIL] 
 Addendum :3-01: Updated Information 
 With the advent of the public Internet, SCP-:3 infections are now propagating at an exponential growth rate. Current models show that SCP-:3 may outgrow the Foundation's ability to suppress it by 199█. 
 Addendum :3-02: Researcher Note 
 I don't know about this, guys. :\ I don't really see anything wrong with :3, and I certainly don't see why we're throwing away so much money to keep :P contained. 
 Dr. S█████ :) 
 Addendum :3-03: Incident :3-17 
 Dr. S█████ has been terminated following confirmed terminal infection of SCP-:3. 
 Addendum :3-04: Incident :3-38 
 Mass SCP-:3 outbreaks have been reported by Foundation assets in Japan. These new instances of SCP-:3 documented have massively increased virulence, and were described as ""cute"" by initial contact agents before their self-termination. 
 Addendum :3-05: Memetic Counter-Agent :3-01B 
 By O5 Council order, Memetic Counter-Agent :3-01B has been introduced into all major population centers. :3-01B introduces a subtle aversion to elements of SCP-:3, causing individuals who view them to consider them ""silly"" or ""immature"" as well as embedding a slight compulsion to roll their eyes when presented with SCP-:3 instances. This effect has been proven to prevent progression to terminal stage in 99.97% of inoculated subjects.""",,+181,active,joke keter language memetic metamorphic mind-affecting scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-003-j
SCP-004-J,"""Stan from Accounting""","""Object Class: Euclid Thaumiel 
 Special Containment Procedures: The entity is currently housed in the Site-08 North Wing, Accounts Payable office, from Monday to Friday between the hours of 0800 to 1700 hours local, with 1 hour from 1200 to 1300 hours local spent in the North cafeteria, or traversing from there back to his desk. The entity may occasionally need to use the restroom, take breaks by walking the North Wing corridor, or receive water from the water fountain. In the long-term, the entity can be contained by biannual performance reviews indicating that we are pleased but think the entity is capable of more, and annual raises equivalent to rate of inflation, plus four percentage points. The entity may also be enticed to remain in containment by pointing out the low cost of living, easy commute and quality public parks. 
 Description: SCP-004-J is Stanley Nichols, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) (Univ. of Michigan, 1978) and former Chief Financial Officer for [REDACTED], currently employed by the Foundation. SCP-004-J is roughly 180cm tall and weighs roughly 75kg, Caucasian, with thinning brown hair and brown eyes. The entity has been in Foundation containment since July 1991, ostensibly in reply to a job posting. The anomalous properties of the entity manifested after the job was awarded, during mandatory psych and low-level amnestic administration. The staffer assigned to the task flatly refused to administer amnestics to the entity, claiming that SCP-004-J was ""a real visionary,"" and that ""[it] would be a waste of drugs, and a needless CapEx hit."" After a brief convention by the hiring department, the Compulsion and Cognitohazard Unit, and Site-04's subject matter expert on hazardous humanoids, the agreement was made to contain SCP-004-J under the premise of hiring them for the desired position in accounts payable. 
 SCP-004-J appears to be a very capable accountant and has made commendable efforts in both lowering our annual capital expenditures budget while streamlining our vendor and purchase process for operating expenditures. Furthermore, their holistic approach to purchasing and leveraging the growing internationalization of the supply chain has caused a sea change in our view of the synergistic possibilities to creating a budget-concious deliverable, leading to a paradigm-shift of crowd-sourced 
 It appears the entity was in my vicinity briefly. To summarize, SCP-004-J has a distinct cognitohazardous field that will interfere with thought processes, overriding thought patterns with new ones that encourage growing a business through a set of jargon commonly used by C-level executives (""buzzwords"") while also impairing the ability to think critically. CT scans of foundation employees in the field of SCP-004-J show a lowered neuron excitement state in the occipital cortex and the hippocampus. SCP-004-J was classed as Euclid in August of 1991. 
 SCP-004-J was reclassed as Thaumiel in October of 1992 following a near-total containment breach in August of 1992 caused by structural damage suffered during Hurricane Andrew at Site-██, during which SCP-004-J was exposed to SCP-106, which is classed Keter and invariably hostile to human life. Rather than panic or hide, SCP-004-J began discussing the importance of residual income and annuities when structuring a quarterly budget. SCP-106 appeared rapt with attention, materialized a business card and agreed to join SCP-004-J for a ""lunch and learn"" at his soonest convenience. Further testing has shown that the cognitohazard surrounding SCP-004-J affects not only humanoids, but every sentient lifeform that has been exposed. 
 In furtherance of a hypothesis posed by Drs. McGinley and White, SCP-004-J was stationed outside the containment cell of SCP-682, at a safe distance but close enough to have the notorious creature in its cognitohazardous field. Audio follows: 
 SCP-682: Kill… (inaudible)… killing… 
 Dr. White: SCP-682, could you repeat that? 
 SCP-682: Killing… bottom… line. 
 Dr. White: I'm sorry? 
 SCP-682: Amortization… buying in this economy… sucker bet. 
 Dr. White: SCP-682, do you own property here? 
 SCP-682: Synergize assets… leverage intellectual capital for… flagship product. 
 (Note from Researcher: At this point, three common white mice are introduced into SCP-682's containment cell. SCP-682 normally devours prey on sight.) 
 SCP-682: Ahhh… a conference call. I sense… redundancies… we must smartsize… to better push the envelope… in our core competencies. 
 (SCP-682 then dismembers and eats two of the three mice.) 
 SCP-682: I hope they find… their severance… suitable.

 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Jr. Researcher R███ is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber kept between 60-80% humidity. Jr. Researcher R███ is to be kept on a diet including 700 grams of glucose in acceptable forms1 as well as 3000 miligrams of water daily. Two guards are to be stationed outside containment armed with steel tactical swords and boxing gloves. Agents stationed on all islands of Hawaii are to continue investigations into reports of abnormally large protea flowers. 
 Description: SCP-6K-J is a large red protea flower growing from the head of Jr. Researcher R███. SCP-6k-J was first discovered three weeks following Jr. Researcher R███’s return from a vacation in Hawaii, when a sprout began growing from his head. SCP-6k-J sprouted in full approximately 4 days later. The anomaly causes Jr. Researcher R███ no pain, but has a noticeable impact on both appetite and behavior. 
 Despite being genetically identifiable as a Hawaiian protea, SCP-6k-J has a minor cognitohazardous effect on certain individuals. This effect causes these individuals to visually perceive SCP-6k-J as a physical manifestation of the color pink, or sometimes white. Viewers who perceive this anomaly often report headaches or nosebleeds after the experience, as well as a mild craving for citrus. 
 SCP-6k-J is partially carnivorous and shows a preference toward human meat, but violent outbursts can be prevented if the anomaly is fed “unlimited candy,” as reported by Jr. Researcher R███. Should SCP-6k-J not be fed sufficient candy, Jr. Researcher R███ will attack and attempt to consume any human or living creature it can. This behavior has been described by witnesses as “mean” or ""scary."" Tests have found that leaves and petals from SCP-6k-J are entirely bulletproof, and cannot be destroyed by any means, excluding sharp blades. Blunt force applied to the main bulb of the flower, primarily by punching or kicking, halts any aggressive behavior and renders SCP-6k-J dormant.

SCP-007-J,"""Unidentified Muffin Creature""","""Item #: SCP-007-J 
 Object Class: Euclid, awaiting advancement to Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: The whereabouts of SCP-007-J are currently unknown, although it has been confirmed that it has not left Site ████ since its initial discovery in Officer Blake and Officer Evan's office. Recon Team Theta is awaiting authorisation to sweep the premises. In the mean time, all staff are advised not to engage SCP-007-J due to its unknown nature. 
 Description: SCP-007-J is a blueberry muffin which belonged to Foundation Officer Evan, prior to the discovery of its anomalous nature and its subsequent designation as an SCP. 
 SCP-007-J was identified during Officers Blake and Evan's assigned lunch hour on ██/██/████. The anomaly occurred during a phone call Officer Evan received, which required him to leave the room. Whilst unobserved by Officer Blake, SCP-007-J, which Officer Evan had left unattended on his desk (planning to consume it after his phone call, believing it to be an ordinary muffin), disappeared by unknown means, leaving only a residue of unknown properties on Officer Blake's lips. 
 The transcript of the exchange which led to SCP-007-J's discovery is recorded below. 
 Officer Evan: (Entering the door, having concluded his phone call.) “Hey man… Oh… dude, where the hell is my muffin?” 
 Officer Blake: “What?” 
 Officer Evan: “No! We have been over the ethics of food stealing! You do not steal another man's pastries!” 
 Officer Blake: “I swear to god I don't know what you're talking about.” 
 Officer Evan: “So my muffin just walked out of here on its own, did it?” 
 Officer Blake: “Well… I don't know… Stranger things have happened! I mean, you can believe in a concrete Weeping Angel or an indestructible, homicidal crocodile, but not a sentient muffin? Wait… do you think that's what we're dealing with here?” 
 Officer Evan: “No, I think you've eaten it. You've still got crumbs on your face, for fuck's sake!” 
 Officer Blake: (Grasping mouth area in panic.) “Oh shit! It's left its residue on me! Grab me an SCP form, I'm gonna run to the med bay and get myself checked out!” 
 Officer Evan: “You're an idiot.” 
 The residue left on Officer Blake's lips was identified as crumbs from SCP-007-J. It is currently unknown how or why SCP-007-J left its mark upon Officer Blake, but medical analysis has revealed no long term effects. As a precaution, Officer Blake is to spend three (3) days in quarantine. 
 Additionally, to prevent other on-site pastries from animating as a result of exposure to SCP-007-J, or the Foundation itself (as may be SCP-007-J's origin) the cafeteria is to be kept under armed guard until SCP-007-J is secured.""",,+280,active,euclid food joke observational scp uncontained,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-007-j

 Description: SCP-008-J was hired for his expertise as an electrician, to repair the lights at Stephany’s Classy Posies, the florist which acts as a front for the ███████ Site. Due to a minor containment breach, the shop was unstaffed when SCP-008-J arrived. Moments later, SCP-008-J was found, aimlessly wandering the halls of the ███████ Site’s restricted corridors.

 Commander Price: (Talking over radio) Alright, Alpha Team, spread out on the south corridor and make as much noise as possible. Beta, try to get the jump on it. Knockout gas is for last resort only, we all know what this thing is like when it’s sleepy! 
 SCP-008-J: Hey! Excuse me! 
 Commander Price: (Startled) Who the hell are you!? 
 SCP-008-J: Alright, mate? I’m Geoff. I’m here to fix the lights. Sorry, there was no one in the shop. 
 Commander Price: No one in the… How did you get back here!? 
 SCP-008-J: (Confused) Erm, I walked? 
 Commander Price: There are three ID card readers between here and the shop! 
 SCP-008-J: Right… Yeah… Look mate, I’ve got five other people to see today. Do you want me to have a look at your lights, or not? 
 Closing Statement: SCP-008-J was placed in the custody of Agent ████████ while the containment breach was suppressed, however, Agent ████████ suffered a fatal aneurism moments later, prompting SCP-008-J to return to Stephanie’s Classy Posies, call for an ambulance, and leave a note, instructing Commander Price to contact him when he is ready to have his lights repaired. 
 Incident: 008/2 
 Date: ██/██/████ 
 Description: SCP-008-J is seen at the ██████ City Foundation carpentry front, Super Craftsmanship Protocols. After requesting to use the on-site lavatories, SCP-008-J mistook the directions given to him, and made his way through a door to the Site’s containment facility. The electronic lock had recently been destroyed by an agent of the Chaos Insurgency, who began hacking into the Foundation’s mainframe, moments after SCP-008-J’s arrival. 
 Transcript: 
 Commander Price: Alright people! I want this site on lockdown and every room powered down but this one! If that stolen data gets transmitted it’s all our asses on the — 
 SCP-008-J: Hey man! Long time no see! 
 Commander Price: What the… 
 SCP-008-J: Don’t you work at a florist? 
 Commander Price: How did…? 
 SCP-008-J: Looks like you’re busy. Sorry, I just got lost on my way to the gents. 
 Commander Price: This is a top-secret military installation! How the hell do you keep doing this? 
 SCP-008-J: You don’t make a lot of sense. Anyone ever tell you that? Anyway, I mention the gents cause I’ve kinda gotta pee. Couldn’t be a pal and point me in the right direction, could you? 
 Closing Statement: While personally leading SCP-008-J to a containment cell, Commander Price was confronted by the Chaos Insurgency agent, and both were taken hostage, under the threat of detonating a handheld explosive. Once clear of the facility, the agent was extracted by car, leaving Commander Price to attempt to capture SCP-008-J at gunpoint, before being arrested by local authorities, allowing SCP-008-J’s escape. 
 Incident: 008/3 
 Date: ██/██/████ 
 Description: SCP-████ began to show signs of awakening from its 2,000 years of hibernation. Because of his nautical combat experience, Commander Price is relocated to the ██████ Site, beneath the Atlantic Ocean, overlooking the fissure in which SCP-████ resides. The means by which SCP-008-J came to be at the site are unknown. 
 Transcript: 
 Commander Price: Alright people, it’s go time! I want suppressing fire on this thing NOW! Neptune squadron, hit it with everything you’ve got! If this thing gets one claw to the surface, then… 
 SCP-008-J: Hey, I remember you! 
 Commander Price: (Exasperated and enraged) FUCK! 
 SCP-008-J: Can you help me out? I’m a bit turned around. I’m trying to get to Grays Street. 
 Commander Price: WE’RE 3,000 METERS UNDER THE FUCKING OCEAN! 
 SCP-008-J: (Produces smartphone) Well that explains why my map won’t load. 
 Commander Price: WHO THE FLAMING CHRIST ARE YOU!? 
 SCP-008-J: Geoff, remember? Hey, are you on Facebook? I feel like I keep running into you! We should be friends! 
 Closing Statement: Due to the absence of holding cells on Site ██████, SCP-008-J was secured in an escape pod, since departure is permitted only with a pass code or ID card. However, after the site suffered a blow from SCP-████, the escape pod malfunctioned and launched from the facility, failing to collide with 17 of SCP-████’s active tentacles, before progressing to open waters. 
 SCP-008-J was lost at sea and presumed dead, until two days later, when Commander Price received a Facebook friend request from SCP-008-J, along with a message, which read, “Sorry about the pod. I left it somewhere in Florida. Hope you get it back ok! :D”""",,+552,active,alive euclid humanoid joke probability sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-008-j
SCP-8==D-J,"""Monster Containment for My Monumental Dong""","""ADULT CONTENT 
 Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. 
 SCP-8==D-J 
 This document contains critical information regarding SCP-8==D-J, an anomaly that can end the frickin' world! And as far as I can see, you don't look like the kind of person that's supposed to see this! Now scram! 
 Item #: SCP-8==D-J 
 Object Class: Ticonderoga 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8==D-J's phallus is to remain fully erect at all times. Should SCP-8==D-J's phallus ever show signs of diminishing size, MTF-Pen-15 (""The Exclusive Club"") is to be deployed to Washington DC disguised as a group of tourists, and arouse SCP-8==D-J's phallus as much as is required to return it to full erection. 
 The Foundation is to both disseminate and deny rumors that the Washington Monument is the penis of a large subterranean entity. Foundation personnel are not to engage in similar theories regarding the SCP-8==D-J, and are instead encouraged to increase dissemination of further WMPTs, or Washington Monument Penis Theories. 
 Should SCP-8==D-J's phallus ever become flaccid, Foundation personnel are encouraged to spend what remaining time they have left with their families and loved ones before a XK-Class End-Of-The-World Scenario occurs. 
 Description: SCP-8==D-J is a large, sentient subterranean entity, standing approximately 6 km tall and weighing approximately 47 million kg. SCP-8==D-J's physical structure is aesthetically and texturally identical to marble and granite, though it is capable of softening and hardening in response to physical stimulation. SCP-8==D-J is otherwise physically identical to a standard human, with the exception of an oddly-shaped phallus. SCP-8==D-J is currently lying prone beneath the National Mall in Washington DC, with its erect phallus protruding from the earth. 
 When solid or liquid matter makes contact with SCP-8==D-J, the subject's anomalous effects occur, converting the matter entirely into the same material composing SCP-8==D-J's body. SCP-8==D-J then reconstitutes any matter affected in this way into its body, adjusting its size and proportions according to the amount of matter incorporated. The exception to this is when a subject touches SCP-8==D-J's phallus, wherein SCP-8==D-J will become noticeably aroused, and its anomalous effects will cease. While aroused, SCP-8==D-J will enter a pseudo-inanimate state, only capable of moaning the words ""Oh fuck, that's good,"" on occasion.1 
 Should SCP-8==D-J's anomalous effects come into effect while on Earth, the entire planet would be incorporated into its mass within 24 hours. 
 Addendum 8==D-J-01: Below is a transcription from Head Researcher Richard Jacques during an orientation regarding the maintenance and research of SCP-8==D-J. 
 <Transcription Begins> 
 Researcher Jacques: -recording this? It's on? Does that light mean it's on? 
 Pause. 
 Researcher Jacques: Good! Let's get started, shall we? 
 Researcher Jacques taps on his laptop, and opens up a presentation which displays on a large monitor next to him. He then steps away from the laptop and pulls out a small remote before turning to face the audience. 
 Researcher Jacques: Welcome! I know I recognize a few faces from previous work, but I figure I should introduce myself anyway. My name is Richard Jacques, and what I'm about to tell you is very, very important. For one reason or another, the Department of Other trusts you all implicitly, and you've been tasked with handling one of our most dangerous and potentially apocalyptic objects in containment. 
 Researcher Jacques clicks a button on the remote, bringing up an above-ground image of the National Mall. 
 Researcher Jacques: Buried beneath Washington DC's National Mall is a massive stone creature capable of assimilating solid matter into its body, and if it were to breach containment, the world would come to an end in a matter of hours. 
 Researcher Jacques clicks the remote and changes the image to include an overlay of a humanoid figure over the previous image. 
 Researcher Jacques: Normally, with an anomaly like this in a place so public, containing it effectively would be near impossible. However, we found a way to both quell a veil breach, and contain its anomalous effects. 
 Researcher Jacques smiles and pauses for dramatic effect. 
 Researcher Jacques: We keep it horny. 
 A snort is heard from the audience. 
 Researcher Jacques: Yes, it's true. For whatever reason, this thing's anomalous effects stop working whenever it's aroused, so your job is to keep it as horny as possible so it doesn't come out of whatever state it's in and, you know, end the world. And for those of you that have a giantism kink, and we know you're here, yes, you can touch it yourself. 
 Nervous laughter from the audience. 
 Researcher Jacques: Anyway… 
 Researcher Jacques clicks the remote twice before displaying an image of the Washington Monument. 
 Researcher Jacques: As you can see, judging by the shape of SCP-8==D-J's penis, you've all figured out how we were able to contain the veil breach as well. The Foundation amnesticized witnesses, a cover story was put in place, and we made it a National Monument. 
 Unknown Voice #1: [Whispering] I fucking knew it… 
 Researcher Jacques: Of course, we had to fudge a few parts in the history books to make sure people wouldn't even think to theorize that that thing's a giant penis. For example, the reason it was built wasn't exactly to memorialize a dead president. 
 Researcher Jacques clicks his remote again, displaying the words ""Thank you for your time"". 
 Researcher Jacques: The Washington Monument, as you can see here, is a part of the cover story the Foundation came up with in order to do everything we could to hide SCP-8==D-J's true nature. Even though it was built in the 1920s, all history books record it being a pre-Civil War project, to make it look like we didn't build a penis to hide the fact that a real penis popped up in the National Mall. 
 Unknown Voice #2: Wait, hold on. You just said that the Washington Monument was a penis? Are there two Washington Monuments? 
 Researcher Jacques: Um… where did I say that? 
 Unknown Voice #2: When you showed us a picture of the Washington Monument and told us it was SCP-8==D-J's penis? 
 Researcher Jacques turns up his eyebrow, then turns around to the display screen. He laughs. 
 Research Jacques: Oh, whoops! Sorry, skipped an image I guess. 
 Researcher Jacques clicks on his remote twice. 
 Researcher Jacques: Yeah, sorry, the real penis is the Lincoln Memorial. Imagine our surprise when the cover story pretty much made itself! 
 Researcher Jacques claps his hands together. 
 Researcher Jacques: Anyway! Let's get going for a couple of field tests to get you all acquainted! Some of the finer details can really only be explained when you see the real thing. 
 Silence. 
 Unknown Voice #1: Wait, so… we're jacking Lincoln off? 
 Researcher Jacques: Oh! No, no, not really. The giant rock monster's penis just LOOKS like Lincoln, but I get the confusion. Any more questions? 
 Several hands shoot up.

SCP-010-J,"""WHAT KETER I DON'T SEE ANY KETER""","""Item #: SCP-010-J 
 Object Class: Completely harmless, stop asking 
 Special Containment Procedures: No containment procedures are necessary, as SCP-010-J is not a threat and nothing to worry about. SCP-010-J is to be peacefully observed from Area-399, which has been designated a no-panicking zone under penalty of termination. 
 Hell, we don't even know what it is, nor do we need to, but we know for certain that it isn't going to hurt anyone, and talking about it is a total waste of time! Oh, well, I guess you'll have to look at some other article that isn't this one. Now. 
 Description: SCP-010-J is an unimportant entity that is not going to turn anyone's iteration of reality into a lifeless blob of primordial sludge. It is not cognitohazardous, not infohazardous, non-toxic, and does not even technically exist. 
 Contrary to dangerous and libelous rumors, SCP-010-J is not made of black holes, as that would mean we'd already be dead, right? Right?! I didn't think so. You can stop worrying about it being made of black holes. I said stop! 
 Addendum: A request has been sent to O5 command to quell any fears people have about SCP-010-J and the giant [DATA EXPUNGED] that it may or may not have in its tendrils, as it's not going to hurt you and frankly it wishes we would all leave it alone. 
 Unfortunately, O5 command has responded by beginning summary terminations of all staff at Area-399 for entirely unrelated reasons. Maybe they just like shooting people! Well, they won't shoot you, so you have nothing to worry about, so go ahead and have a nice, safe day like the rest of us!""","""Look at all these people having fun! Everything is okay!

SCP-011-J,"""The Baby""","""Item #: SCP-011-J 
 Object Class: Euclid (Because we don’t know where it is! Do we? Where’s it gone?) 
 Special Containment Procedures: Any sighting of SCP-011-J must be acknowledged verbally, in a high-pitched voice, with all words sharply enunciated. Subjects must react in the same way when witnessing SCP-011-J disappear. 
 Description: SCP-011-J is the 6-month-old offspring of Foundation Doctor Jones, which has the anomalous power of dematerialising whenever an observer obstructs their vision with their hands, or nearby furniture. When visual contact is re-established, SCP-011-J rematerializes, to the great surprise and relief of onlookers. 
 Doctor Jones: Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!
Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!
Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!
Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!
Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is! 
 Where's he gone!? Where is he? 
 I've got your nose! 
 (Doctor Jones places his thumb between his middle and index fingers, creating the illusion of the amputation of SCP-011-J's nose.) 
 What are you doing there? WHAT YOU DOING!? 
 I'm gonna eat those little legs! Yes I am! 
 (SCP-011-J gives a positive response to a simulation of being eaten, suggesting masochistic tendencies.)

Conclusion: SCP-011-J is anomalously adorable.

SCP-012-J,"""Special Comedy Procedures""","""Item #: SCP-012-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: An investigation is underway, to locate the “live studio audience”, SCP-012-J is supposedly recorded in front of. Until it is located, all Foundation staff are advised to be wary of exaggerated speech and body language, and implausible social faux pas. If an instance of SCP-012-J is suspected, staff are to refrain from vocalising any classified information. 
 Description: SCP-012-J is a phenomenon which infrequently affects the behaviour of Foundation sites' occupants, and how they are perceived by surveillance equipment. Footage of each instance of SCP-012-J is preceded by a short musical number, followed by the phrase “This episode of Special Comedy Procedures was filmed in front of a live studio audience”. While SCP-012-J is in effect, affected personnel will begin to speak more clearly, and periodically emphasise the end of sentences, after which, all subjects will remain silent for several seconds, while a soundtrack of multiple people laughing can be heard on the surveillance feed. In addition, surveillance equipment will periodically deactivate, commonly after a subject makes a confident claim regarding future events, surveillance will then resume when the claim is disproven, at which point the original speaker will resignedly comment thusly. 
 Below are the transcripts of each instance of SCP-012-J to date.

 Officer Daniels: You know, some of the containment procedures around here are just crazy! 
 Agent Steele: What do you mean? 
 Officer Daniels: Well I was just putting SCP-999 into its pen, the lovable rascal, and it’s got security coming out the wazoo! Steel cell, pressure plates and laser sensors to make sure it’s in there, and blast shields like you wouldn’t believe! 
 Agent Steele: Dude, that’s not SCP-999’s containment pen. 
 Agent Bridger: Yeah man, that sounds more like SCP-096’s containment! 
 Officer Daniels: But if I just put SCP-999 in SCP-096’s containment cell, then that means… UH OH!

SCP-013-J,"""The Cuttlefish of Ultimate Wisdom""","""Item #: SCP-013-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: The Northern region of the Forest of █████████, where SCP-013-J is known to manifest, has been registered as a protected wildlife preserve, and fenced off and labelled accordingly. Foundation agents posing as forest rangers are on hand to deter trespassers. A platform, equipped with recording and transmitting equipment, is in place, directly overlooking the space SCP-013-J occupies when manifested. 
 SCP-013-J is to be approached by a Foundation field agent on a weekly basis, and the exchange is to be remotely observed and directed by at least one member of the 05 Council. Unless contradicted by the 05 Council member(s) in question, all of SCP-013-J's demands and suggestions are to be met as soon as possible. 
 Description: SCP-013-J is an instance of Sepia officinalis (common cuttlefish). Unlike its non-anomalous counterparts, SCP-013-J is seventeen meters in length, hovers in the air, while moving as an instance would while underwater, and speaks with a loud, high-pitched, echoing voice by unknown means, in addition, a bright, golden light radiates, seemingly from within SCP-013-J. 
 SCP-013-J regularly refers to itself as ""The Cuttlefish of Ultimate Wisdom"", and requires others to, before it will interact with them. SCP-013-J claims to be sensitive to future events, and will share possible means of preventing upcoming disasters, while often refusing to relinquish details of the disasters themselves. 
 SCP-013-J speaks with an overly-dramatic voice and often utilizes alternations in volume, pauses and extended vowel sounds for dramatic emphasis. Foundation staff who have been deemed quick to anger are not to approach SCP-013-J. 
 Below are the most recent recorded interactions with SCP-013-J. 
 Date: ██/██/████

Agent Archer: SCP-013…

SCP-013-J: The Cuttlefish of ULTIMATE wisdom!

Agent Archer: Cuttlefish… of Ultimate Wisdom…

SCP-013-J: Speak, mortal!

Agent Archer: I've come to ask if you have any information regarding potential disasters in the future.

SCP-013-J: Be warned! Be waaarned! Heed the Cuttlefish of Ultimate Wisdom! Disaster loooooms! Unless the president of ████████████ makes tomorrow's commute on a pogo stick, society shall fall! Death shall hail from the sky! DEATH!

Agent Archer: A… a pogo stick?

SCP-013-J: A POGO STICK! (A bolt of lightning strikes in the distance)

Agent Archer: Is there any… other way we can…

SCP-013-J: THE CUTTLEFISH HAS SPOKEN!

(SCP-013-J dematerializes with a bright flash of light)

Outcome: A social media campaign was launched, detailing how President ██████████ would be travelling to work on a pogo stick to raise awareness of depression. The president himself was compelled to comply with SCP-013-J's demand by the use of drug-induced hypnosis. During the president's commute, a multi-car collision claimed the lives of █ of ████████████'s citizens. It was calculated that the president would also have been affected by the incident. It is unknown if SCP-013-J knew the exact nature of the incident, and could have easily provided a less conspicuous deterrent. 
 Date: ██/██/████

SCP-013-J: Step forwards Timothy!

Agent Black: My name is Lesley…

SCP-013-J: What can the Cuttlefish of UUULTIMATE WIIIISDOM assist you with on this fine evening?

Agent Black: It's… 11AM, but anyway, I've come for a report on future events.

SCP-013-J: DEEEAAATH!

Agent Black: (After waiting several seconds for SCP-013-J to continue) Erm…

SCP-013-J: DEATH RACES FOR US IN ATTRACTIVE YET FUNCTIONAL FOOTWEAR! And unless Foundation Commander ███████ greets all whom she interacts with, with her warmest of hugs, IT SHALL COME FOR HER!

Agent Black: Yeah… I've met Commander ███████, I think in her entire life, she's gouged more people's eyeballs out with her bare hands, than hugged…

SCP-013-J: Hugs are all that will spare her soul!

Agent Black: Really? It has to be hugs? Because after last time, it seems like…

SCP-013-J: HUUU… (SCP-013-J continues to make a ""U"" sound, getting steadily quieter as it fades from sight, completing the word ""hugs"" seconds after disappearing entirely.)

Outcome: At the express order of three 05 Council Members, Commander ███████ agreed to take the measures SCP-013-J recommended, to prevent her imminent death. Five days after SCP-013-J's prediction, Commander ███████ was deploying a squadron of agents to contain SCP-████, by reluctantly hugging each of them in turn, when one agent tearfully conceded how much he had needed a hug. The agent went on to confess to being an undercover agent of the Chaos Insurgency, and had been instructed to sabotage the mission, taking the lives of all agents present, including Commander ███████. Moved by Commander ███████'s display of affection, the Agent vowed to reconsider his life choices. Commander ███████ responded by executing him where he stood. 
 Date: ██/██/████

Agent Harris: Cuttlefish of…

SCP-013-J: BEHOLD, FROM ABOVE! (A beam of golden light descends from above the space directly between SCP-013-J and Agent Harris, and a three-layer, Victoria Sponge Cake on a plate slowly descends to the platform.)

Agent Harris: It's… a cake.

SCP-013-J: The fondest of wishes for your birthday, Agent Patsy!

Agent Harris: My… birthday is in July… also it's Harris.

SCP-013-J: And yet in my home dimension, precisely three years and four hours have passed since the moment of your birth!

Agent Harris: Huh… how about that? I actually needed to ask you about future…

SCP-013-J: FEAST ON CAKE OR DOOM SHALL COME FOR US ALL!

Agent Harris: Wait, seriously? The cake is the thing?

SCP-013-J: CONSUUUME THE CAKE!

(At the approval of the monitoring 05 Council member, Agent Harris begins eating the cake.)

Agent Harris: (Repulsed) Oh god! It tastes like fish!

SCP-013-J: FISH IS AN INVALUABLE SOURCE OF PROTEIN AND OMEGA-3!

Agent Harris: THERE'S WHIPPED CREAM ON IT!

SCP-013-J: EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH WHIPPED CREAM!

(At the order of the 05 Council member, Agent Harris reluctantly eats the remainder of the cake, over the course of half an hour.)

Agent Harris: (Nauseously) How on… on earth did that accomplish anything?

SCP-013-J: A world without cake has been evaded!

Agent Harris: Are you serious!? Is that the only reason I just ate a fucking FISH SPONGE CAKE!?

SCP-013-J: CAKE FOR EVERYONE!

(Identical cakes begin appearing in the same way at every Foundation site on the planet, regardless of secrecy. Analysis reveals the cakes to be made almost entirely of halibut.)

Outcome: It is reluctantly decided that SCP-013-J's suggestions will continue to be taken seriously and its orders followed until it ceases to be a valuable asset to the Foundation. 
 Date: ██/██/████

Agent Griffiths: SCP…

SCP-013-J: CUTTLEFISH OF…

Agent Griffiths: …ultimate wisdom, right.

SCP-013-J: UUULTIMATE… WISDOM!

Agent Griffiths: Cuttlefish of Ultimate Wisdom, yes. I've come for your report on future events.

SCP-013-J: Senior Foundation Officer Spencer is in peril! GRAVE PERIL!

Agent Griffiths: (Sarcastically) And, by any chance, do you know of a way to save him, which also, completely unnecessarily makes him look like an idiot?

SCP-013-J: Anyone who witnesses Officer Spencer must hurl with all their might, whatever it is they are holding, at the good officer's face!

Agent Griffiths: Yeah, why not?

Conclusion: For the following two weeks, Foundation staff comply with SCP-013-J's instructions, throwing mostly food and stationery at Officer Spencer, until he is injured by a trainee, transporting an anomalous typewriter. During Officer Spencer's time in the on-site medical facility, Foundation doctors discovered a tumor forming in his brain, and ultimately removed it without incident. 
 Date: ██/██/████

Agent Williams: Cuttlefish of Ul…

SCP-013-J: GAAASP!

Agent Williams: (After waiting several seconds.) I'm sorry, was that an instruction, or…

SCP-013-J: The foul hand of evil has made its way even to this very sanctuary!

Agent Williams: (Looking around nervously.) Has it?

SCP-013-J: AGENT JENNIFER WALKER!

Agent Williams: I'm clearly a man…

SCP-013-J: REMOVE YOUR TROUSERS OR YOU WILL DOOM US ALL TO ETERNAL DAMNATION!

Agent Williams: Ugh, seriously!?

SCP-013-J: THE HOUR OF DAMNATION TICKS CLOSER!

(Agent Williams is ordered to comply by the supervising 05 Council member. After hesitantly moving his hands towards his belt, Williams reconsiders and his face contorts in anger.)

Agent Williams: No! You know what? FUCK YOU! (Points to SCP-013-J) and FUCK YOU! (Points to the camera through which the 05 Council member is surveying.) I joined the Foundation to fight monsters, not to entertain some stupid, immature space fish!

SCP-013-J: FOOL! You have doomed us all!

Agent Williams: HOW!?

SCP-013-J: Cuttlefish are CEPHALOPOOODS! Ignorance is the greatest danger in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE!

Agent Williams: And I suppose we could have avoided this HORRIBLE CATASTROPHE if I'd been standing here with no trousers like an idiot! Well forgive me if I can… Whoa…

(A black and red aura surrounds Agent Williams' trousers and he begins to rise into the air.)

Agent Williams' Trousers: Mwahahaaa! Now that I have harnessed enough of this mortal's irritation, I can destroy this world and nothing can stop me!

Agent Williams: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?

Agent Williams' Trousers: MWAAAHAHAHAHAHA!

(Agent Williams' trousers vanish in a shroud of black smoke, leaving Williams to fall to the ground.)

Closing Statement: Agent Williams' employment with the Foundation was terminated immediately. All future agents to interact with SCP-013-J are to be thoroughly evaluated by an on-site psychiatrist and selected based on past experience of dealing with similarly troubling entities. The hunt for former Agent Williams' trousers, the newly designated SCP-████, is underway, but thus far, no progress has been made.""",,+309,active,airborne alive animal cephalopodic euclid joke predictive sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-013-j
SCP-014-J,"""A Fork""","""Item #: SCP-014 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-014’s holding cell is to remain locked at all times. Personnel of sufficient clearance (as determined by facility administrator) may be admitted to view SCP-014 after submitting a formal request three (3) weeks in advance. Anyone handling SCP-014 must undergo Special Precautionary Protocol 014-2. All personnel exposed to SCP-014 must be subsequently subjected to a forty-eight (48) hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. And after exposure, common sense dictates that one should wash their hands. 
 Description: SCP-014 takes the form of an antique dinner fork, well worn, and, as near as can be estimated, not cleaned since the 1890s. The object is fashioned from the electroplated nickel-silver typical of the suspected period of its manufacture and the rightmost tine is bent █████████ (██) degrees outward. Brown stains and mold adorn the prongs and the pits of the decorative parts of the handle. Analysis of this material seems to indicate that SCP-014 was last used on some form of beef. 
 SCP-014 was moved to this facility in the early 1970s and seems, for all intents and purposes, to be an entirely mundane dinner fork. If it is possessed of any extra-ordinary qualities, these are known only to those in the very highest echelon of this project’s coordinators, whose representatives assure us that SCP-014 is, quote, “Very Important”. Officers who have spent time alone with SCP-014 are unanimous in their appreciation that the object is of great significance (hence its continued presence at this site), though none can quite say why [see »Testimony of Major ██████ ██████████, February, 1972]. 
 No tests on SCP-014 are authorized. Any personnel observed attempting to compromise SCP-014 in any way are to be terminated at once. 
 Note: I request that we have this SCP decommissioned immediately. It's too dangerous to be kept alive. -Agent Spoon

SCP-015-J,"""Just Really Misunderstood""","""Item #: SCP-015-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Upon its arrival at Site-77, SCP-015-J is to be gifted with a new terrarium fully fitted to whatever needs it might have, including: 
 Agent Boyd has proposed that, following SCP-015-J settling into its new home, that any informal reference to her as ""that weird snake girl"" be stricken from the record. 
 Description: SCP-015-J can be used both to identify a domesticated snake, purchased by Researcher Slug, to be delivered to Site-77 in the not too distant future and the anomalous levels of excitement felt by Agent Boyd upon hearing the news. 
 Available sources suggest SCP-015-J will be a small friend, with a spiraling pattern to its scales and a strawberry-colored complexion. It is hoped that SCP-015-J will be both capable of slithering and the flicking of the tongue. SCP-015-J is currently speculated to be just a baby, but this has not been confirmed. Direct consultation with Researcher Slug or other Foundation personnel connected with SCP-015-J has been restricted due to Agent Boyd being shy. 
 All details regarding SCP-015-J have been heard secondhand through overheard conversation, with details like ""long"" ""twirly"" and ""red"" occurring repeatedly along with references to SCP-015-J having imminent hunger needs. It is hoped that Researcher Slug will not be grossed out the first time that SCP-015-J does a big poop or eats a fuzzy mouse. Agent Boyd is available for reference in the event of such an occurrence, due to her years of experience in the field. 
 Cost-benefit analysis of lifting the ban on storing frozen mice in shared refrigeration spaces due to the presence of multiple animals utilizing said mice in their diets is ongoing. — Agent Boyd

SCP-016-J,"""Is That A Missile In Your Pocket?""","""Item #: SCP-016-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Standard Containment Procedures: SCP-016-J is to be kept in an armory with other explosive devices, all of which must be smaller than SCP-016-J. Use of SCP-016-J outside of testing is prohibited. Conversation is (whilst not encouraged) permitted. 
 Description: SCP-016-J is a ballistic missile approximately 2.4 meters tall and 0.3 meters in diameter. Rude comments have been spray painted on all parts of SCP-016-J, obscuring the original paint job. These comments include ""Cock Block This!"" and ""I hear you like it rough"". 
 SCP-016-J is capable of telepathic communication with any living being within four meters. While researchers have been reluctant to give interviews, information from said interviews suggests SCP-016-J is both sapient and sentient. SCP-016-J insists on being used in battle, and claims ""to have been on the front lines many times"". 
 Addendum SCP-016-J-1: Below is a partial transcript from an interview with SCP-016-J. 
 SCP-016-J: C’mon doc. Just fire me. You know I’ll satisfy you. 
 Dr. Teller: We’re not going to use you. We’re not fighting any wars or anything. 
 SCP-016-J: Oh, I think you’re just scared. You’re afraid because I’m the biggest missile you’ve ever seen. You don’t know how much I’m going to hurt. But you can do it. I’ve seen your silos, just waiting for me. I’ll fit. 
 Dr. Teller: But you’re not even that big… 
 SCP-016-J: What do you mean? I’m huge! 
 Dr. Teller: No, I’ve totally seen— never mind. Yes, you’re the biggest missile I’ve ever seen. 
 SCP-016-J: So just aim me toward the battle field. I just want to explode all over some trenches. 
 Dr. Teller: Ok, that’s it. I’m ending this interview. 
 SCP-016-J: No, don’t stop. Talk ballistic to me. 
 Addendum SCP-016-J-2: After continued insistence from SCP-016-J, and agreement from researchers that SCP-016-J's destruction would improve workplace morale, a test of firing SCP-016-J was conducted. 
 SCP-016-J was aimed at a target 100km away and fired. During the flight, SCP-016-J greatly reduced in size, measuring 0.5m long, and 0.15m in diameter two seconds after launch.

SCP-017-J,"""Narcissistic Time Displacement Field""","""Item #: SCP-017-J 
 Object Class: Euclid Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-017-1-J is to be cordially uninvited from all events, get togethers, and special occasions. If SCP-017-1-J makes contact with intent to be at a function or event, the event should take place as intended and no changes should be made. However, all attendees of said event should be informed not to mention the existence, or the effects, of SCP-017-J to SCP-017-1-J, and just pretend to be overjoyed that she showed up in the first place. 
 Description: SCP-017-J is a temporal anomaly which is, in essence, a field of time displacement. The effect of SCP-017-J varies with no known causality, but the field can cause time displacement in measures varying from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The field itself is geographically locked to the residence located at ████ ████████ ██████, Dayton, OH. The only subject seemingly affected by the field is SCP-017-1-J. 
 SCP-017-1-J is a human female named Barbara ████. She is 67 years old of above average means and is in annoyingly good health. She has the seemingly preternatural ability to externalize blame, particularly on members of her family. The subject also displays a remarkable inability to read a clock or watch. Her residence falls within the area affected by SCP-017-J. 
 When the subject is intending to leave her residence, the temporal field activates. She then experiences the time displacement, making her between 15 minutes to 3 hours late to every god damned thing I have ever invited her to. 
 Logs 
 5/20/16- SCP-017-1-J is one hour and 45 minutes late for a college graduation ceremony for her own fucking daughter a post-graduate doctoral valedictorian. When asked, she dismisses it and instead blames ███████ University, insisting that if they had received all of that tuition money, then they could at least check to make sure everyone's family could be there. SCP-017-1-J is summarily reminded that she did not have to pay any tuition money since the graduate was the recipient of a full scholarship. 
 11/23/17- SCP-017-1-J is late for Thanksgiving dinner by two hours and 45 minutes. The subject swears that she ""left the house on time"" when asked, and blames the traffic. She then laments that the best part of the turkey has already been eaten, and then blames Dr. Connors for eating it. The subject rudely reminds Dr. Connors that she should be on a diet to lose weight if she ever wants a man to marry her and give the subject grandchildren, in front of the ENTIRE FAMILY. Dr. Connors believes that to be a bunch of bullshit and that SCP-017-1-J is being a huge bitch to her in her own home. Furthermore, she's focusing on her career and SCP-017-1-J should maybe have Thanksgiving by her damn self next year since nothing that Dr. Connors ever does is good enough for the subject.

SCP-018-J,"""Normal Trench Coat Worn By An Adult""","""Item #: SCP-018-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-018-J can be kept in any standard containment locker. Individuals at the site containing SCP-018-J (currently Site-41) should not be permitted access to secure facilities, classified information, motor vehicles, or alcohol solely on the basis of perceived adulthood. 
 Description: SCP-018-J is a brown trench coat with no identifying labels or markings. When two or more individuals age 16 or younger attempt to wear SCP-018-J simultaneously, it will expand to accommodate all wearers such that they are hidden by the coat. This property has been confirmed to work for groups of up to 75 children (see Incident 018-J-A). This effect does not extend to the collar, which does not change size and can only fit one head. 
 While wearing SCP-018-J in the described manner, all wearers gain increased strength, dexterity, and stamina,1 enabling them to move around in SCP-018-J without risk of injury, fatigue, or falls. Still, some degree of cooperation remains necessary to perform activities, particularly with larger groups of children. 
 SCP-018-J exerts a cognitohazardous effect on direct observers, who will treat its wearer(s) as a single adult human, despite any evidence to the contrary. While they may find the wearers' appearance, gait, or size unusual, at no point will they suspect that SCP-018-J contains children. The exact perceived age of the wearers varies, but is generally high enough that their age alone will not present an impediment to the task at hand. 
 When SCP-018-J is doffed, it reverts to its default size and shape, and all anomalous effects cease immediately. 
 Recovery: SCP-018-J was recovered from Dubuque, Iowa, after the Foundation intercepted reports of a ""very large, misshapen adult wearing a trench coat"" at a local American Red Cross blood donation center. The individual in question — later determined to be nine small children — was attempting to donate blood, but staff were refusing to serve it due to concerns that its size (3.1m tall, 2.1m wide) and shape (toroidal) were the result of a potentially contagious medical condition. 
 An interview with the children involved found that they had become inspired to donate blood by an informational pamphlet, and had more or less willed SCP-018-J into existence shortly thereafter to fulfill this purpose. Claims that this explanation is ""unsatisfactory"" or ""implausible"" are unfounded. 
 Incident 018-J-A: On 2016-07-16, Dr. Quinn submitted a request to test SCP-018-J with a very large group of children, with the stated intention of ""[T]his kind of thing is practically an inevitability because of the narrative constraints on SCPs — seriously, they're predictable as hell once you've read enough — so we might as well get it over with."" The request was granted, and on 2016-07-18, 75 D-Class personnel (primarily, but not exclusively, war orphans)2 between the ages of 6 and 10 were procured and secured in a room with SCP-018-J. 
 The first 23 minutes of the test consisted primarily of the subjects expressing distress and making sporadic requests for medicine, their parents, sunlight, etc. At 23m19s, D-7145 (codename ""Tricky Trickster"") donned SCP-018-J; the other subjects, perceiving him to be an adult, deduced that SCP-018-J was a magical coat3 that turned the wearer into an adult4 and attempted to procure it for themselves. 
 Following this, for the sake of brevity, no data was recorded and no observations were made for about twenty minutes. This incident report is estimated to be 40% shorter because of this decision. 
 At 45m55s, the testing chamber was breached by all test subjects, who were wearing SCP-018-J in a fashion comparable to a very tall adult humanoid, with D-7145 at the helm. The collective began assaulting nearby personnel, presumably in retaliation for miscellaneous crimes against humanity perpetrated against them by the Foundation. 
 Mobile Task Force Xi-9, ""Orphan Wranglers"", who were stationed at Site-41 for unrelated reasons, were immediately deployed to counter the threat; however, they failed to recognize the presence of orphans within SCP-018-J, and were crushed by the group's ""fists"" (two D-Class personnel in fetal positions) while conferring with command to confirm their orders. 
 After all personnel in SCP-018-J's immediate vicinity were either dispelled or motionless, the D-Class personnel proceeded to follow signs leading to Site-41's emergency exit. As Site-41 is located beneath an orphanage, it was feared that a breach would expose additional children to SCP-018-J, resulting in an apocalyptic chain reaction wherein SCP-018-J would envelop a critical mass of children.5 
 Site security, unable to stop SCP-018-J via normal means, instead altered and/or moved signs leading to exits such that the D-Class personnel would be redirected to Site-41's movie theater; a screening of The Passion of the Christ (2004) was hastily arranged, and as expected, the D-Class personnel were distracted from their escape by the prospect of viewing an R-rated movie. Personnel attending to the theater allowed the subjects to procure a ticket and assisted it in entering the theater, which was just barely large enough to contain SCP-018-J. 
 Shortly after the subjects entered the theater, all lights were dimmed and the theater's thermostat was adjusted to 29°C (84°F). Within four minutes, most subjects expressed discomfort with the temperature, and believing that the low lighting would enable them to avoid suspicion, cooperated to doff SCP-018-J. As expected, SCP-018-J immediately reverted to its normal size, and the D-Class personnel fell out of their prior configuration. Security personnel were then able to enter and seize SCP-018-J and the subjects; the former was returned to containment, while the latter were probably fed to monsters or something. 
 This test did not provide any data that could improve SCP-018-J's containment and did not shed any particular light on the nature of its anomalous properties, while causing significant damage to Site-41 and its inhabitants. Dr. Quinn was consequently reassigned to Theater Duty.""",,+165,active,clothing cognitohazard joke observational safe scp sensory visual,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-018-j
SCP-020-J,"""A Pale Comparison""","""Item #: SCP-020-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: A wall has been constructed around SCP-020-J to prevent subjects from perceiving it. 
 Additionally, the fifth-floor stairs on the B-wing have been permanently sealed off. Personnel are asked to instead use the elevator or the A-wing stairs. 
 Description: SCP-020-J is a dark blue plastic mop bucket. If a subject perceives the object, they will be compelled to approach SCP-020-J and kick it. Upon striking the object the subject will cease all further life functions and instantly expire via anomalous means. 
 Though SCP-020-J responds to the force it is struck with appropriately, it does not exhibit signs of damage. 
 Discovery: SCP-020-J was discovered outside Site-30's 5th-floor janitor closet alongside the corpses of Janitor Worth, five site guards, D-1221, and Dr. Cimmerian. 
 As the corpses were initially believed to be the results of a containment breach, additional site guards were deployed to the area. Fifteen of the deployed guards were observed to self-terminate via SCP-020-J through security cameras. 
 Eighteen D-Class personnel were dispatched to the area in an attempt to secure the object, resulting in the self-termination of all involved subjects. Lead Researcher Jade then instructed the remaining D-Class personnel to kick SCP-020-J down the hallway and towards a corner, then cover it. Following the self-termination of twelve additional D-Class personnel, SCP-020-J was successfully contained.

If you have accessed this document unintentionally, cease reading immediately and contact the Cognitohazard Research Group. 
 Item #: SCP-022-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures:  Due to widespread public knowledge of SCP-022-J, containment of SCP-022-J is limited to mitigating the damage caused by its effects. To this effect, the following procedures are to be enacted: 
 Because the risks SCP-022-J-1 poses to Foundation personnel, especially those in charge of designing containment procedures, any containment procedures proposal containing relevant keywords are to be checked by personnel immunized against SCP-022-J-1. Calming agents of choice (chocolate, beer, Diazepam, Xanax, cannabis) are to be available to such personnel to mitigate the effects of SCP-022-J-2. 
 Description:  SCP-022-J is the pure, solid form of chemical element commonly known as titanium (Ti), of atomic number of 22, and average molar mass of 47.86 g/mol.  In its active state, SCP-022-J appears as a shiny, hard solid of density approximately 4.5 g/ccm, and melting point of approximately 1940 K. SCP-022-J behaves as a paramagnetic metal in most aspects, and possesses a tensile strength of roughly 434 MPa, remarkable for its low density. 
 SCP-022-J is an infohazard — knowledge about it causes the manifestation of two distinct sets of symptoms, designated SCP-022-J-1 and SCP-022-J-2. 
 SCP-022-J-1 initially manifests when an individual with no prior knowledge is exposed to incomplete or erroneous information about SCP-022-J's physical properties, and its recommended usage.
Individuals under the effects of SCP-022-J-1 will gradually begin to assert the superiority of SCP-022-J as a structural material, and recommend or attempt to enforce its use as such whenever possible, even in cases where this has a significant negative effect on functionality. Common terms used by affected individuals with reference to SCP-022-J-1 include ""strongest metal in the world,"" ""supertough supermetal,"" ""refined, impenetrable metal,"" and ""The He-Man of materials"". In the cases where this behaviour induces a performance failure or deficiency, an affected individual will refuse to acknowledge THAT THEY FUCKED UP SERIOUSLY WHO THE FUCK MAKES A TITANIUM ANCHOR SCP-022-J's role in the incident, inventing increasingly bizarre alternative explanations. 
 SCP-022-J-2 manifests when an individual FUCKING GETS A CLUE SHEESH IS IT SO HARD TO READ A GODDAMN STANDARD is exposed to accurate information about SCP-022-J's physical properties, and correct recommended usage guidelines. Individuals already affected by SCP-022-J-1 CAN'T FUCKING GET IT IN THEIR GODDAMN HEADS WITH A HAMMER IF I HEAR ABOUT TITANIUM BEING THE STRONGEST METAL I WILL PUNCH THEM IN THE DICK WITH A FIST MADE OF show considerable resistance to SCP-022-J-2.
Subjects affected by SCP-022-J-2 display signs of anger and mental distress at mentions of pure titanium or its usage, to the point of becoming physically violent. This is especially marked when the triggers are usual vectors of SCP-022-J-1, such as media containing examples of inappropriate uses of SCP-022-J.

 BEGIN LOG 
 Dr. Johnson: So…what do we do with this thing again? 
 Dr. Nichols: I'm not sure. We're supposed to be testing with it, but I don't think that there's much here. 
 Dr. Johnson: I got my tongue stuck once when I was a kid to one almost like this. Not anomalous obviously, but either way, man did it suck. 
 Dr. Nichols: I'm pretty sure that is just an urban legend. 
 Dr. Johnson: Are you serious? Aren't you a materials scientist? 
 Dr. Nichols: Yes. I'm just saying, I think that's just an urban legend. 
 Dr. Johnson exits the chamber for a few minutes, and returns with a D-Class designated D-4278 
 Dr. Johnson: Hey, D-4278, lick it. 
 D-4278: Isn't that the light pole? Look, I'm not stupid, I'll get my tongue stuck to it. 
 Dr. Johnson: Just do it, that's an order. 
 D-4278: Honestly? I'd rather be shot. 
 Dr. Nichols: Oh for god's sake, it's just an urban legend, watch. 
 Dr. Nichols is observed to walk up to EthCP-026-J and press their tongue up against EthCP-026-J, sticking it firmly to the pole 
 Dr. Nicholth: OH GOH, MY THONGUE, ITH THUCK, HELP. 
 Dr. Johnson: Y'know what, you deserve that, you twit. 
 D-4278: Shouldn't you like…get help or something? 
 Dr. Nicholth: YETH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP ME 
 Dr. Johnson: Nnnnope. Anyone dumb enough to stick their tongue to an anomalously sub-zero pole deserves what's coming. 
 Dr. Nicholth: THITH ITHN'T FUNNY! 
 Dr. Johnson: Yeth it ith. This is why you should avoid cold posts. 
 D-4278 and Dr. Johnson exit the chamber, leaving Dr. Nichols stuck to EthCP-026-J

 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-027-J is to be contained on the couch in the proper holder that I spent like thirty goddamned dollars on, designated SCP-027-J-1. (SCP-027-J-1 is a cheap piece of plastic you paid too much money on, and shall be designated SCP-027-J-$). at the Benson household,even though it's probably on fucking Jupiter half the time. until further notice. 
 When SCP-027-J switches phase, Researcher Benson is to be consulted as to where the hell she left it Researcher Benson is to calm the hell down, it's just a remote. SCP-027-J is to be placed in the proper receptacle. (I swear to god, Phil, don't say a goddamned word). 
 Description: SCP-027-J is a Roku Cable Box Roku Cable Box Television Remote Control, which appears to have two quantum states: 
 At no time can SCP-027-J exist in both states, because Researcher Benson can't keep track of the goddamned remotes when she's watching her ""programs"" due to its anomalous effect of making Researcher Benson a dickhead due to its anomalous effect. 
 SCP-027-J was first discovered when after installing the new Roku TV in the living room, when Researcher Benson immediately lost the Roku remote the Roku remote went missing. After two weeks, the Roku remote was discovered, and the cable box remote promptly dissapeared Researcher Benson lost my remote, to stop me from watching dance moms SCP-027-J changed quantum states, leading to the discovery of the nature of SCP-027-J. 
 Addendum A On [REDACTED] For god's sake Jillian, stop redacting my notes no, it was discovered that both the cable box and the Roku have smartphone apps, which can control both devices. Researcher Benson kindly installed these apps, and set them up on both his, and Researcher Benson's smartphones Both applications were installed, and SCP-027-J's effect now appears to extend to Researcher Benson's phone now too, since that's either dead or missing all the time For fuck's sake Phil, it's not that big of a deal, when I'm home. Just stop losing the goddamned remotes! Research in to the spread of SCP-027-J's effect and Jillian's inability to keep track of a THOUSAND DOLLAR PHONE It was 450, you giant crybaby. is ongoing.

SCP-029-J,"""Jesus Take the Wheel!""","""Item #: SCP-029-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-029-J is currently considered tentatively contained. Due to the low-risk nature of SCP-029-J, police reports are to be monitored for potential reports of SCP-029-J. Class A amnestics are to be administered as necessary. At this time, no additional containment procedures are required, pending review yearly on 1/12 or as needed. 
 {DEPRECATED AS OF 4/21/17: Foundation Agents are to attempt to contact SCP-029-J in order to attempt to discern more stringent containment procedures.} At this time, for resource and sanity reasons, additional attempts to contact SCP-029-J are not considered conducive to study, and are to be discontinued. 
 Description: SCP-029-J is an adult male of apparent Middle Eastern descent, who claims to be Jesus Christ. SCP-029-J is exclusively found in the Newark, New Jersey area, posing as a for-hire driver using the application Uber. Foundation Agents contacted Uber to request the driving records and registration of SCP-029-J. No records were found. 
 Upon being assigned to a subject's request, SCP-029-J's vehicle is listed as ""A flaming hot ride"", of the current year, and is always 1 minute from the pick up location. Of note, the Uber application does not allow this to be listed as a model name. SCP-029-J's vehicle has been determined to be a multi-entity combination designated SCP-029-J-1 through SCP-029-J-4. 
 SCP-029-J's vehicle has been shown to take a variety of appearances. This ability is contingent upon the concentration of SCP-029-J-1 through -4. These entities have to date, proven easily distracted, leading to a high incidence of sightings of SCP-029-J, especially around the Christmas and Easter holidays. 
 The entities that comprise SCP-029-J's vehicle are as follows:

 Involved Foundation Assets: Agent Rocco Ricciardi, Level 3, Intelligence Division. Agent Lisa Stokes, Level 1, Intelligence Division (probational) 
 Encountered Anomalies: SCP-029-J, SCP-029-J-1, SCP-029-J-2, SCP-029-J-3, SCP-029-J-4 
 SCP-029-J: Alright, shut up, shut up they're coming. 
 SCP-029-J-2: You think you can pull this off? 
 SCP-029-J-2 has the appearance of a late model sedan. No identifying badges can be seen. Its license plate reads SPQRSUX. 
 SCP-029-J: I don't really care, you think that ""supply side jesus"" stuff is okay? 
 SCP-029-J-2: Whatever. 
 SCP-029-J-1: At least you're not riding on your fucking eyes, Mike. 
 SCP-029-J-3: Stop moaning, Ray. 
 SCP-029-J: Gabe, shut up and start the music! 
 SCP-029-J-3: Fine, fine. 
 ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" from the ""Hamlet 2"" soundtrack can be heard playing from SCP-029-J-3. 
 McIntyre approaches the car. 
 McIntyre: Hi, Jesus? [Pronounced as in the Hispanic form] 
 SCP-029-J: Actually it's Yeshua, but you can call me Jay if you want, that's me! 
 McIntyre: Awesome, thanks! 
 McIntyre opens the door to SCP-029-J's vehicle. SCP-029-J-4 begins making sounds approximating an engine turning over, and idling. Poorly. 
 SCP-029-J-4: NnnnVROOM! BrbrbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrrBRBrbrbrbrbr. 
 SCP-029-J: Comfortable back there? Would you like a bottle of water? I've got refrigerated, mineral, holy, transubstantiated into wine… 
 McIntyre: Err, haha, no I'm alright, but it's a little warm, can you turn up the AC? 
 SCP-029-J leans down towards the dashboard. 
 SCP-029-J: Come on Mike, ease up the fiery wings a bit, she's uncomfortable. 
 SCP-029-J-2: I swear. I've lead God's forces to glory for thousands of battles. I'm supposed to be your general, but now I'm climate control for lazy millenials today. Sheesh. 
 SCP-029-J-2 ceases to appear as a late model sedan, and can be seen in its angelic form (See Description). Its wings make up the bulk of the vehicle's chassis, with its face situated where the rear axle should be. SCP-026-J-1 continues to appear as non-anomalous wheels. 
 McIntyre: Holy fuck, what the fuck! Jesus Christ, what the hell is this?! 
 SCP-029-J: Hey! That's not very nice! Don't be a dick to Mike and Ray! 
 SCP-029-J-2: Yeah what the deuce, lady. I've got human butt meat on my face, and you're screaming at me?! I'm trying to do you a favor with the fire here! 
 SCP-029-J-2 returns to its physical appearance of a late-model sedan. SCP-029-J-1 begins turning at this point, prompting Foundation agents to follow. 
 SCP-029-J-1: Ow ow ow ow ow ow… 
 SCP-029-J-2: You okay Ray? 
 SCP-029-J-1: Broken…glass…ow.. Just had to pick the most run down hellhole on earth: New Jersey. 
 McIntyre has begun screaming at this point, and attempting to leave SCP-029-J's vehicle, but is unable to climb over SCP-029-J-2. 
 McIntyre: Oh god, oh god, oh god, please help me. 
 SCP-029-J: Yeah, I'm trying. Calm down lady. Ray, come on man, say the thing. 
 SCP-029-J-1: Alright, alright. 
 SCP-029-J-1 can be heard making a sound similar to clearing its throat 
 SCP-029-J-1: BE NOT AFRAID. 
 McIntyre stops panicking and appears shocked and agitated. 
 McIntyre: Are you fucking with me?! That's it?! ""Be not afraid?"" 
 SCP-029-J-1: Hey, it was good enough for his mom. 
 McIntyre: Wait…his mom…what the fuck, you're literally Jesus? That's not just a name? 
 SCP-029-J: Of course! We're all here to try and reach the people. And what better way, but through Uber! Jesus saves…you a trip! Ha! 
 Several seconds pass. SCP-029-J-3 ceases to play music. 
 SCP-029-J-3: Awkward. 
 SCP-029-J-1: By the way, we're here. Also, ow. 
 McIntyre: Open the fucking door. 
 SCP-029-J: Oh come on lady, I'm Jesus Christ, Lamb of God! I'm here to help! 
 McIntyre: Just open the door. 
 SCP-029-J: Okay, okay. No need to crucify anyone or anything. Ha-ha! 
 Several moments pass 
 SCP-029-J: No? Alright, open the door, Mike. 
 SCP-029-J-2 opens its side door, and McIntyre quickly exits in to the building. 
 McIntyre: FREAK! 
 Several moments pass in silence. 
 SCP-029-J: So…think she's gonna tip us?

 Summary 
 On 4/19/2017 Foundation agents successfully acquired SCP-029-J as their driver after [REDACTED] unsuccessful attempts. SCP-029-J simultaneously picked up 12 separate containment teams at the same time. The following is a transcript between SCP-029-J, the various entities that make up SCP-029-J's vehicle, and Agent Mathews; an expert in Abrahamic religious studies and a trained field agent. 
 Transcript of Encounter

 Encountered Anomalies: SCP-029-J, SCP-029-J-1, SCP-029-J-2, SCP-029-J-3, SCP-029-J-4 
 SCP-029-J: Alright, you guys have been trying to get me in to containment for what feels like forty eons, so I guess we should talk. 
 Agent Mathews: Excuse me? I'm just trying to get to Forest Hills. 
 SCP-029-J: Agent James Mathews, age 31, Foundation Level 2 Agent, you have two kids, a wife, and are having an affair with Jeanie from HR? 
 Agent Mathews appears distressed. 
 Agent Mathews: Wait, what?! How did you know about Jeanie? 
 SCP-029-J-2: …did you actually just ask God how he knows something? 
 Agent Mathews lifts his lapel mic slightly. 
 Agent Mathews: I am not having an affair. 
 SCP-029-J-2: Whatever man, you know he knows everything right? 
 Agent Mathews is informed of the other containment teams also being detained by SCP-029-J. 
 Agent Mathews: Wait, how are you here? 
 SCP-029-J: Okay say it with me, Omni…omni puh… omnipr… 
 Agent Mathews sighs. 
 Agent Mathews: Omnipresent. 
 SCP-029-J: Bingo. 
 Agent Mathews: Okay. So you know who I am, and what I'm here for. So I guess my question is: Why? 
 SCP-029-J: I've gotten a bad rap. We're here to try and improve my image. 
 Agent Mathews: And who, exactly is ""we""? 
 SCP-029-J-1: I'm the wheels. 
 SCP-029-J-2: I'm the body! 
 SCP-029-J-4: We're the engine! Vroom vroom! 
 SCP-029-J: Yeah. Me, Ray, Mike, Gabe, and the Cherubs. I was just gonna have Ray do it, but it wasn't a great idea. He's a kick ass set of wheels-within-wheels but he doesn't get XM radio. I guess you could say, this is a real electric car! Ha! 
 Several moments pass in silence 
 SCP-029-J: See, in the Septuagint חשמל was translated as ἤλεκτρον, and from there… 
 Agent Mathews: No, I got it. I'm one of maybe four people in the world who would get that joke, and it still wasn't funny. 
 SCP-029-J-3 ceases playing the Jesus Christ Superstar soundtrack. 
 SCP-029-J-3: Awkward. If he knows we're angels, can I talk now? My throat's getting dry, from singing the whole time. 
 SCP-029-J: No, you're the radio, Gabe. 
 SCP-029-J-3: Fine. Doo doo do, dah dah dum…who are you what do you say you aaaahre! 
 SCP-029-J-3 continues vocalizing. 
 SCP-029-J-2: Your singing sucks, Gabe, you can't hit any of Judas' high notes properly. 
 SCP-029-J-3: Shut up, Mike. At least I don't have to get my wings dinged by drunks every night. 
 SCP-029-J-1: At least you don't have to drive on your EYES all night! Every night! 
 SCP-029-J-4 become visible, as a group of 12 visually non-anomalous Welsh corgis 
 SCP-029-J-4: Are we getting food soon? There's a Halal Guys on Halsey! 
 SCP-029-J: Heavenly host, I command you to stop complaining or so help me, I'll turn this chariot around! 
 SCP-029-J-1 through 4 in unison: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. 
 Agent Mathews: So…wait, you're telling me this 'car' that I'm in right now, is the Archangel Michael as the chassis, the Archangel Gabriel as the radio, Raziel, Lord of Thrones as the wheels, and is pulled by 12 Cherubim. And it's driven by Jesus? 
 SCP-029-J: Give this man a shekel! I figured if I do this, people can really get to know their savior. 
 Agent Mathews: Okay, so isn't your chariot supposed to have this giant multitude of angels, move the heavens and the earth, everything like that? 
 SCP-029-J hesitates for a moment 
 SCP-029-J: Uuuusually, yes. Circumstances were slightly different. Dad wouldn't lend me the regular throne-chariot. So instead, I've got my own sweet whip to drive people around in. 
 Agent Mathews: Sweet…wh..okay. So why did all of the angels help? 
 SCP-029-J-1: I owed him for a taco, and he said we'd be square. 
 SCP-029-J-2: He said he'd watch my dogs next weekend while I'm in Cabo. 
 SCP-029-J-3: I just like singing! 
 SCP-029-J-4: Wait, this is voluntary? 
 Agent Mathews: Okay one last question. 
 SCP-029-J: Of course. 
 Agent Mathews: Why do the Cherubim look like corgis? 
 SCP-029-J: They always look like that. How do you guys keep getting the descriptions so wrong? 
 Agent Mathews: I'd like to get out of the car, please.

SCP-030-J,"""Jim Henson is a Real Son of a Bitch""","""Anomalous Item Entry 
 Item #: SCP-030-J 
 Object Class: Uncontained 
 As of the death of the carrier, SCP-030-J will be considered neutralized after the death of all humans who witnessed SCP-030-J's infection vector prior to May 16, 1990. 
 At this time, Foundation scientists are unsure if SCP-030-J is a memetic effect of the original carrier, or a simple infohazard. Data points to the former, as SCP-030-J infections have sharply declined since the death of the original infection vector, PoI-2844. 
 SCP-030-J reached near-epidemic levels due to the actions of PoI-2844 during 1969. All infected human subjects became carriers of SCP-030-J and spread the infection further. Further infections from these carriers did not produce the same carrier effect. It is projected SCP-030-J will be neutralized by 2090. 
 Foundation agents are still in the process of uncovering the original cause of SCP-030-J within PoI-2844 with little success. 
 The following interview was recorded in 1971 between Agent Joaqin Kasim, and PoI-2844. It had come to Foundation attention that SCP-030-J was being spread deliberately by PoI-2844. Due to the celebrity nature of PoI-2844, containment of PoI-2844 was considered untenable with the Foundation level of technology and amnestics available at the time. 
 Agent Kasim: “So, you were aware that SCP-030-J was anomalous at the time you infected several million people?"" 
 PoI-2844: “I was, actually. I don’t feel particularly bad either, it was hell for me before I did it.” 
 Agent Kasim: “What do you mean by that?” 
 PoI-2844: “So, it’s not a big deal for all of you, if I go—” 
 PoI-2844 speaks the trigger phrase. Agent Kasim repeats the counter phrases and expresses mild annoyance. 
 Agent Kasim: “Please don’t do that again, I don’t appreciate being compelled.” 
 PoI-2844: “Sorry, I just find it funny. Before, I would be muttering m- 
 Agent Kasim holds up a hand 
 PoI-2844: ""Sorry. The phrase, constantly. I was going out of my gourd, I thought I was gonna end up in a padded room. "" 
 Agent Kasim: “So you decided to infect millions of people.” 
 PoI-2844: “Well, every time someone else gave back the response, I felt a little better. It came out less and less. I figured if you had a million or so people doing it, I’d get a little peace.” 
 Agent Kasim: “Okay, last question. Did the TV show come before, or after SCP-030-J infected you?”

 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: On October ██ agents are to be given an assorted amount of candy and placed strategically in each city. When approached agents are to distribute the candy so as to avoid hostilities. Agents are urged to not distribute items pertaining to dental hygiene. 
 Description: SCP-031-J is an event that occurs annually. Analyses of trends have pinpointed the event to fall on October ██, however minor fluctuations are suspected. The trend of appearance of the event mainly occurs in North America and Western Europe, however rogue instances of SCP-031-J may manifest in various cities worldwide. 
 At the time of an SCP-031-J event, several instances of SCP-031-J-1 will manifest on various city streets. Appearances of instances of SCP-031-J-1 vary wildly, however they have been described as mainly grotesque. Documented instances have resembled historical figures, pop culture icons and occasionally instances of SCP-777-J, SCP-1344-J and SCP-2008-J. Typically instances will be much shorter than an average adult, with an average height of ~1.4 meters. 
 Instances of SCP-031-J-1 will approach households in an ordered fashion and exclaim ""█████ or █████"". The exact meaning of this phrase is unknown, however researchers have suggested that this may indicate that the instances will damage the household or owners unless they are given some form of appeasement. This is verified by the giving of candy to instances of SCP-031-J-1, which appears to appease them until the next household. 
 Shorter instances of SCP-031-J-1 show a tendency to place various adult humans in a trance state. Subjects act with a spirit of benevolence towards instances, and will fiercely defend instances in case of attack.1 
 SCP-031-J also has several other effects:

SCP-042-J,"""Billions of Anomalous Pillows""","""Item #: SCP-042-J 
 Object Class: Euclid Neutralized Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to the nature of the phenomenon, SCP-042-J cannot be contained, but an ongoing effort by Foundation field agents to destroy every pillow on Earth has been very effective useless in curbing the phenomenon. 
 Description: SCP-042-J is a visual spacetime anomaly observed in 100% of tested pillows, regardless of the method or time of construction. Test subjects with only one eye appear to be immune to its effects. 
 The anomaly occurs when a test subject lays their head on a pillow and closes one eye, then switches eyes. SCP-042-J appears to teleport the pillow to a slightly different location relative to the previously observed position. To an outside observer, the pillow does not appear to move at all, an obvious indication of psychic projection by the pillow something. A slight ""crossing"" of the eyes makes it apparent that the pillow exists in two points in spacetime simultaneously; how it does this is creepy as hell unknown. 
 Timeline: 
 4/24/1992: Now-deceased comedian George Carlin references the anomaly at a show at the Paramount Theater in New York. It is unknown how Carlin initially discovered the anomaly. A transcript follows: 
 Like when you have your head on a pillow… did you ever notice when you have your head on a pillow, if you close the bottom eye, the pillow is down there, then if you switch eyes, the pillow moves up there? ""Whoa, holy shit Dave! Look at this! The mystery of the moving pillow…"" 
 11/10/1992: Carlin's show from April 24th is released on HBO, titled Jammin' in New York. The anomaly instantly begins to manifest itself across the United States. Dr. █████ theorizes that Carlin is ""a host spreading the parasite, or an alien or some shit."" 
 11/11/1992: Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (""City Slickers"") is deployed and Carlin is apprehended and brought to Site-28 for interrogation. Carlin was highly uncooperative and was released after autographing Dr. █████'s lab coat and receiving a Class-C amnesiac. 
 11/14/1992: SCP status assigned after Dr. █████ spent a full night observing the anomaly. Research on SCP-042-J begins in earnest. 
 11/15/1992: Seventeen (17) D-Class personnel were used as test subjects. All subjects confirmed that they saw the phenomenon, with the most common response being that SCP-042-J was ""weird as shit."" 
 11/17/1992: Dr. █████ resigns citing not having been able to sleep since the phenomenon was first detected. Dr. ███ takes over as project head. 
 11/18/1992: D-33023 is apparently immune to the effects of SCP-042-J, by way of having lost an eye while performing [REDACTED]. Further investigation using D-33023 is approved. 
 Ewwww, how did he even..? -Dr. ███ 
 11/20/1992: It is decided by Dr. █████ that between the fact that all pillows seem to exhibit this anomaly and the sheer number of pillows on Earth, SCP-042-J has a high likelihood of being malicious, and a pre-emptive plan of attack is necessary. Requesting reclassification to Keter. 
 Denied. -O5-█ 
 11/21/1992: Requesting parameter modification to Euclid-D to better protect the populace. 
 Approved. Destroy, destroy, destroy. God help us all. -O5-█ 
 11/22/1992: Given the success of testing with D-33023, Mobile Task Force Kappa-7 (""Hammurabi's Lawyers"") has been created with the assignment to remove an eye from every person on the planet. 
 I can't believe we didn't think of this sooner. -Dr. ███ 
 11/23/1992: Dr. ███ has been demoted and MTF Kappa-7 disbanded. 
 Who the hell promoted this man? He's not even a real doctor. -O5-█ 
 11/24/1992: Dr. ███████ replaces Dr. ███ effective immediately. 
 11/26/1992: It is determined that all pillows in the New York City metropolitan area have been affected by SCP-042-J. Mobile Task Force Kappa-8 (""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"") has been created with the assignment of neutralizing every pillow in New York City. 
 Why did Dr. ███ want to cut out all the eyeballs? It's much cheaper and less painful to destroy all the pillows. - Dr. ███████ 
 12/3/1992: Increased budget requested for MTF Kappa-8. Projections show it will take over 700 years to neutralize every pillow in New York at this rate. 
 Approved. –O5-█ 
 3/7/1993: Due to the greatly increased budget and access to SCP-1543-J, neutralizing of New York City's pillows has been completed. Rioting subsided after the first few weeks of martial law. Dr. ███████ has met with Administrator █████ to discuss plans for North America and the world. 
 When in doubt, launch into the sun. -O5-█ 
 3/16/1993: The SCP Foundation now stands for ""Secure, Contain, Pillows."" MTF Kappa-8 has merged with MTF Omega-7 (""Pandora's Box"") to form Joint Task Force Zeta-1 (""No Rest for the Wicked""). Using SCP-076-2's unique abilities targeted towards pillows, we anticipate total elimination of pillows from Earth by 12/31/1997. 
 Secure. Contain. Pillows. –Administrator █████ 
 7/29/1993: JTF Zeta-1 has successfully destroyed every pillow in North America. MTF Epsilon-21 (""Pillow Fighters"") is formed to monitor the continent for pillow-like activity and neutralize any pro-pillow advocates. 
 Filthy pillow huggers. Request re-assignment to MTF Epsilon-21. –Able 
 Denied. –O5-█ 
 5/16/1995: Success in Europe. No notable casualties except for the entire population of the country of Iceland, which was inadvertently set on fire from the air. Dr. ███████ has been placed on paid leave for one week as punishment. 
 Ironic, that. The punishment would've been longer but, you know. Björk. –O5-█ 
 6/6/1996: The last pillow on Earth has been destroyed, well ahead of schedule. The role of JTF Zeta-1 has changed to monitoring/policing. 
 A victory for mankind. –Dr. ███████ 
 6/9/1996: Junior Researcher █████ notices that SCP-042-J still exists on the bed itself, and in fact pillows are not and have never been central to the anomaly.

SCP-048-J,"""Negative Probability Phrase""","""Item #: SCP-048-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to its prevalence in public society, no method has proven effective in fully containing SCP-048-J. Rumors are to be disseminated to the public that the use of SCP-048-J is ""bad luck"" to discourage the continuation of its use. This is to be accomplished through word of mouth and by representing SCP-048-J in a negative light in mass media. All Foundation employees are to be alerted to the true nature of SCP-048-J and requested to minimize or fully cease its use in their speech and writing. 
 Description: SCP-048-J is a set of anomalous phrases which, when spoken or written, will cause manipulation of probability in the user's vicinity. These shifts in probability are universally detrimental to the user or the completion of the user's objectives, and to any factors or individuals that may have been directly beneficial to the user. SCP-048-J consists primarily of the phrase ""T█████ c██'█ g██ a██ w████"" but variations of this phrase also seem to activate SCP-048-J's probability manipulation effect.

 F.A.Q. 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-049-J is contained at Site-19 Site-101 Site-17 Site-81 Site-13 Special Restricted High Security Top Secret MK-Ultra Area Region Landmass 101.5 WFML near Richmond, VA. SCP-049-J is permitted to leave its holding cell only under supervision of two (2) (II) (两1) (dos) guards armed with AR-15 rifles and stun batons. 
 Due to olfactory concerns for staff assigned to SCP-049-J, the entity is no longer allowed to remove its mask. 
 Description: SCP-049-J is a humanoid entity wearing the period appropriate garb of a medieval plague doctor. Further analysis of SCP-049-J has revealed that under its robes, the entity is composed mostly of moss, wads of tissue, and other, smaller plague doctor masks. It is generally compliant with Foundation staff, but will sometimes lie and occasionally sweat profusely for no reason whatsoever. 
 During SCP-049-J’s time in Foundation custody, it has continually claimed to be a powerful magical doctor wizard, capable of “curing” that which “ails mankind”. To date, it has been unable to cure literally anything, and typically only exacerbates conditions considerably. 
 While this alone would not be enough for the Foundation to hold SCP-049-J indefinitely as an anomalous entity, it has also proven capable of somehow always evading capture and escaping from Foundation sites after its true lack of capabilities are revealed. Because of this, and because of staff’s unwavering curiosity as to whether it has any of the self-proclaimed magical healing abilities it describes, SCP-049-J is to be housed and treated as an anomalous entity.

SCP-50-AE-J,"""The Deagle""","""Item #: SCP-50-AE-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-50-AE-J is to be kept in a steel box locked with a padlock and wrapped in an American flag. The box containing SCP-50-AE-J is to be kept away from the following: Russian literature, radios, the Pope, first generation Russian immigrants, and pictures of Ronald Reagan. In case of [REDACTED] security staff are to begin humming the Star Spangled Banner while weeping a single tear. 
 Description: SCP-50-AE-J is an IMI Desert Eagle, with an American flag print grip. SCP-50-AE-J is unremarkable except for the fact that when fired, an adult bald eagle, designated SCP-50-AE-1, emerges from the barrel and attacks anyone who displays Communist beliefs, Russian ancestry, or unpatriotic leanings. SCP-50-AE-1 differs from a normal bald eagle specimen in that it not only appears to be able to detect sociopolitical beliefs, but also can talk, usually screaming slogans such as ""Better dead than red"" and ""Democracy is non-negotiable"". Investigations into the further properties of SCP-50-AE-1 have been stymied by the fact that SCP-50-AE-1 continues to attack Foundation scientists, calling them ""PINKO FUCKS"". 
 Test Log: SCP-50-AE-J 
 Test #1: SCP-50-AE-J was fired at a Class-D test subject, D-1409. SCP-50-AE-1 emerged, and savaged D-1409, while yelling ""UP YOUR LEBENSRAUM YOU UBERMENSCH FUCK"". D-1409 was later discovered to be of predominantly German heritage, but was a 2nd generation American immigrant with full citizenship. 
 Discoveries: SCP-50-AE-1 appears to be able to distinguish genetic and racial information in its targets. SCP-50-AE-1 also appears to have a profound dislike of Germans. D-1409 is to be incinerated entirely, after his testicles are recovered from SCP-50-AE-1. 
 Test #2: SCP-50-AE-J was fired at Class-D test subject D-6554. SCP-50-AE-1 emerged, and following its usual pattern of behavior, disemboweled D-6554 while simultaneously screeching ""The only good communist is a communist with his guts held in my dripping claws"". D-6554's death was later discovered to have been hastened by anaphylactic shock from an allergic reaction, caused by particulates in his lungs found to be consistent with matter from [REDACTED]. A follow up investigation confirmed that D-1409 had performed a test involving [REDACTED], shortly before testing with SCP-50-AE-J began. 
 Discoveries: SCP-50-AE-1 is a consistent entity, and appears to be summoned rather than created when SCP-50-AE-J is fired.

 Item #: SCP-055-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Personnel are to refrain from entering SCP-055-J’s containment chamber. Personnel that have been exposed to SCP-055-J or report experiencing its anomalous properties are to be given Class C Amnestic treatment. 
 Symptoms of SCP-055-J exposure are as follows: 
 Speaking of SCP-055-J is strictly forbidden, as well as thinking about SCP-055-J and any other sort of activity that would give it any sort of attention whatsoever. To prevent further exposure, it is advised that all Personnel refrain from direct eye contact with anything around them and cover their ears when in the presence of anything remotely resembling SCP-055-J. 
 While it is believed that SCP-055-J is kept within a standard containment chamber, this cannot be fully determined due to its anomalous nature. Other possible forms of SCP-055-J's containment have been theorized: 
 Description: The exact appearance, nature and properties of SCP-055-J are currently unknown. SCP-055-J is believed to be capable of affecting individuals via sensory input, as subjects are incapable of sensing its presence by any means. 
 It is speculated that SCP-055-J actively hides its true nature. The most reasonable conclusion for this is that SCP-055-J is an incredibly hostile entity, possibly of Keter or even Apollyon levels of threat. There's really no way to conclude what this thing is and I think it's best we just assume the worst. 
 Discovery: SCP-055-J’s anomalous nature was discovered by the newly appointed Researcher Smalls (Memetic and Cognitohazardous research Division) following assignment to the respected anomaly. Researcher Smalls and assistant Researcher Agnew are the first reported subjects to have been exposed to SCP-055-J. It is unknown how many more have been affected. 
 If you are reading this it may already be too late. May God help us all. 
 Addendum 055-J-2: The following is a log of Researcher Smalls initial discovery of SCP-055-J. 
 Researcher Agnew: Okay here we are. This is the containment chamber for the new SCP, right? 
 Researcher Smalls: Yeah, should be. 
 Both enter the containment chamber of SCP-055-J. It is empty. 
 Researcher Agnew: Wait, what the hell? Where is it? Did we enter the wrong chamber by mistake? 
 Researcher Smalls: Huh. I think so, come on let’s- No… Wait! 
 Researcher Agnew: What is it? 
 Researcher Smalls: What if this is the containment chamber? 
 Researcher Agnew: What do you mean? 
 Researcher Smalls: Well, we don’t know what this thing is, right? We haven’t looked over its notes properly yet. It was our job to write up the description. What if this is what it does? 
 Researcher Agnew: What are you on about? 
 Researcher Smalls: What if it’s only making us think that it’s not here? I mean we contain all sorts of crazy perception warping things here. What if we’re incapable of perceiving it visually? Or that we immediately forget what it looks like the minute we look at it? 
 Researcher Agnew: …Well, that’s a scary thought. 
 Researcher Smalls: Exactly! But what if the moment we turn away, we forget that it even existed? Damm this thing is tricky. 
 Researcher Agnew: We could call for help? 
 Researcher Smalls: But then more people will be drawn in here and affected by it! We can’t let anything of the sort happen! 
 Researcher Agnew: Well wait, wouldn't something we can't see even when we're looking at it just be 'nothing'? Following that logic, it's everywhere around us. 
 Researcher Smalls visibly retches, a look of horror overcomes his face 
 Researcher Smalls: Oh god… You're right! 
 Researcher Smalls looks around the chamber in random directions 
 Researcher Smalls: You hear that!? We know your game! You’re not gonna make fools out of us! 
 Researcher Agnew: No, I mean… What are you doing? 
 Researcher Smalls: Writing up the containment document, we’ll have to do it now before we leave. Otherwise, we’ll forget! 
 Researcher Smalls spends the next several minutes writing the document of SCP-055-J on his laptop while periodically looking around the room. Researcher Agnew returns to the entrance of the chamber. 
 Researcher Smalls: There! Now everyone will know! We’d better head over for Amnestics. Who knows what sort of memetic effects this thing has had on us… 
 Researcher Agnew: Erm… Smalls? I think you should- 
 Researcher Smalls hurries out of SCP-055-J's containment chamber. Researcher Agnew looks back at the front of the chamber door before sighing and following. On the front of the chamber is a sign reading ‘Janitorial closet 055 - Closed for maintenance’.

During the winter months, SCP-063-J may be checked out for experimentation with explicit permission from O5-2. Due to previous frequent containment breaches, at no point during the summer is SCP-063-J allowed to be removed from its container. 
 Description: SCP-063-J is a surface made of poly-vinyl chloride resin with topological genus 0. When filled, SCP-063-J most closely resembles a sphere. Attempts to characterise the shape of SCP-063-J while empty, beyond trivial topological classification, are ongoing but have been described as ""frustrating"" and ""pointless"". 
 The anomalous properties of SCP-063-J manifest in two distinct effects. The first is that any individual that is made aware of SCP-063-J undergoes a compulsion to bring it to the immediate vicinity of the nearest large body of water that the individual deems 'clean'. This effect appears to be seasonal. The second is that SCP-063-J cannot be classified as Euclid. 
 Jr. Researcher Riemann was recalled from his vacation to investigate the second anomalous effect. 
 Ok I don't know how many times I have to explain this. Just because things are non-Euclidean doesn't mean they're anomalous or spooky! So what if you can't draw parallel lines on it or sum the angles of a triangle to 180! It's a beach ball! There are so many other interesting geometries! Like hyperbolic! Or Seifert Fibers! And look, I've been thinking about one that tracks the inner product on an arbitrary smooth manifold and 
 Update: Jr. Researcher Riemann's access to SCP-063-J has been revoked, because something is wrong with him. Jr. Researcher Riemann is also no longer allowed to talk about esoteric geometries.""",,+92,active,esoteric-class joke mathematical scp sphere toy,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-063-j

 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-065-J is to be contained in a simulated desert ecosystem, and provided with water and fertilizer weekly. SCP-065-J is to be provided with recording devices and the recordings provided to Site-19's recreational center. No recordings on Mondays. 
 Description: SCP-065-J is a collection of three desert cacti. SCP-065-J do not differ in physical appearance from non-anomalous cacti, despite being capable of speech, and usually wear sombreros. SCP-065-J are designated from SCP-065-J-1 to 3. 
 SCP-065-J display sapient behavior, and are capable of understanding and speaking English and Spanish. SCP-065-J often communicates in song. SCP-065-J was recovered from the Arizona Desert, and was brought to the Foundation's attention by a rogue outbreak of spontaneous musicals in the surrounding area.

SCP-069-J,"""""Sisters of Cheyenne Point""""","""Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-069 is stored in its original packaging in a standard Safe-class object secure locker at Site 19. 
 Access to SCP-069 requires prior permission from at least two (2) Level-3 personnel, and SCP-069 may only be used on a secure, isolated computer in the Anomalous Data Laboratory of Section 3. Use of SCP-069 on any terminal with a live network or internet connection will be cause for immediate revocation of access rights or termination. 
 Personnel found using SCP-069 for excessive periods of time or in dereliction of duty will be terminated immediately. 
 Description: SCP-069 was retrieved by SCP-507 during a displacement period lasting from ██/█/200█ to ██/█/200█. Upon his return, SCP-069 was found in his possession and immediately taken into custody by the recovery team. 
 SCP-069 appears to be a commercially produced software DVD and accompanying instruction manual in its original soft case. When placed into any PC with a supported Windows operating system, the disc appears to contain a Japanese-style ""dating-sim"" visual novel program in English. The title of the software is ""The Sisters of Cheyenne Point"" by ""Superstar Catalyst Project"". 
 SCP-069 is reportedly ""very well written"" and ""decently drawn"", according to male test subjects who have been exposed to the software. Such subjects will often use SCP-069 for hours at a time, neglecting all other activity in an attempt to attain ""100% completion"". Female test subjects exhibited little to no interest in SCP-069. Possible memetic properties are under investigation and all exposed test subjects have been quarantined under standard memetic agent screening protocols. 
 Addendum 069-1: Research into SCP-069 has yielded no memetic properties. SCP-069 has been reclassified from Euclid to Safe.

 Cast: 
 T.J. ██████: You are a new transfer student at the prestigious Cheyenne Point Academy and have moved to the city of Cheyenne Point after having a nervous breakdown at your old school. A caring person, you have nonetheless never seemed to have much luck with girls, but with a fresh start in a new environment, maybe that will change! 
 Karen █████████: The leader of the Sisters Club, Karen is strong and stubborn individual who despises bullies and never backs down from a fight. She was nicknamed ""Break"" by the other students for supposedly breaking the arm of an upperclassman, but under her tough exterior is a soft side that is rarely seen. She saves you from delinquents on your first day of class, and seems to have taken a keen interest in you. 
 Beatrice ██████: Athletic and always energetic, Beatrice is a small but feisty competitor who loves to win at sports. She is playful and outgoing, but worries that others think she isn't mature or feminine enough because she has never had a boyfriend. 
 Rachel █████████: The class representative of your homeroom and a top student at Cheyenne Point Academy, Rachel is a kind and caring figure who is always willing to help but secretly isn't very confident about herself. She prefers to be called by her last name, and her favorite animal is the raven. 
 ████████ Kondraki: An upperclassman and captain of the fencing team, he is extremely arrogant and abrasive to those who he doesn't consider one of his henchmen. An infamous bully, you manage to accidentally get on the bad side of his cohorts on your first day at school.

 Dr. Gears: The principal of Cheyenne Point Academy. He doesn't talk a lot, is usually emotionless, and isn't seen around the school grounds very much, either. Keeping to the administrative hall of the Academy, a lot of students think that he might secretly be a robot with human skin. 
 Dr. Bright: The vice-principal of Cheyenne Point Academy, he is aloof, sarcastic, and feared for his strict punishments. However, he is also your [REDACTED] and helped you get back onto your feet and into this school after your breakdown, so what could he be hiding under that harsh exterior? 
 Mr. Strelnikov: A history teacher at Cheyenne Point Academy, he often teaches lessons that may not necessarily be historically accurate. He also yells a lot and scares the underclassmen who are unfortunate enough to be in his class. 
 Dr. Clef: Another teacher at Cheyenne Point Academy. Never seen in a classroom, no one is quite sure what he actually does at the Academy. His creepy attitude, tendency to stalk people, and the fact that his face is almost always hidden behind a huge hat has a lot of the female students thinking that he's a pervert.

These safe houses are to be equipped with a large memetic deterrent consisting of a sign that states ""NO GURLZ ALLOWD!!"" and various drawings of cool boy stuff like dragons. No pink is to be allowed into these safe houses. 
 Description: SCP-078-J is a highly contagious biohazard spread through physical contact with SCP-078-J-1 (Especially on the lips!!). Although the properties of SCP-078-J are not fully understood, it is well known for causing various cases of yuckiness, bad smells, and immediate death. 
 SCP-078-J-1 is a malevolent creature that typically inhabits an area colloquially known as the ""playground"". There are several different versions of SCP-078-J-1 that will wander this area at any given time. Current research performed by Junior Researcher James1 has pointed towards SCP-078-J-1 possibly being extraterrestrial in origin. That would certainly explain why they don't like Power Rangers. 
 Prolonged exposure to SCP-078-J carriers results in an expansion of the larynx, a development of the sexual organs, an increase in bodily growth, and the sprouting of various hairs around the body, as well as a marked fondness towards SCP-078-J-1.

 Item #: SCP-80s-J 
 Object Class: Uncontained 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-80s-J is currently uncontained. Mobile Task Force G-IJ0 “Parents Just Don’t Understand” have been tasked with implementing more effective containment procedures, or any at all. 
 Description: SCP-80s-J is the group designation for four anomalous human children, ages 12-13, currently residing within the midwest town of Point Ellis, Nebraska. SCP-80s-J are capable of a variety of anomalous abilities, specifically, advanced perception, ability to escape (former) trained personnel with years of containment experience, ability to commune with anomalous creatures, and more. The full range of SCP-80s-J’s abilities are not known. 
 Each instance of SCP-80s-J is listed below: 
 Addendum 80s-J.1: Discovery 
 SCP-80s-J was discovered in March of 1982, when Foundation personnel arrived at the town of Point Ellis to seek and contain an eldritch abomination called “Vog the Mutilator”. SCP-80s-J instances were able to evade containment personnel at every turn, eventually allowing for Vog the Mutilator to breach containment and escape. 
 Addendum 80s-J.2: Audio Logs 
 The following are excerpts from audio logs collected by Foundation containment personnel during the attempted containment of Vog the Mutilator. 
 D-9 Eda: We’re moving into the library now. 
 Command: Copy that. Remember, we’re looking for anything that might connect back to Vog. Ancient manuscripts, hidden town maps showing underground catacombs, convenient hidden passageways, that sort of thing. 
 D-9 Harris: Copy that. Looks like the library is empty. (Pauses) Wait, hey, what are those kids doing over there? Hey you kids, what are you doing over there? 
 SCP-80s-J-1: Uh… oh, nothing mister. Just doing some, uh, uh— 
 SCP-80s-J-3: Homework! 
 SCP-80s-J-1: That’s right! Homework! Have to keep up our education, you know! 
 D-9 Eda: I like your attitude, kid. Stay in school, don’t do drugs. Say, what’s that the short one is hiding behind his back? 
 SCP-80s-J-4: 我什么也不隐瞒。1 
 D-9 Eda: Welp. Good enough for me. You kids get out of here. Go on now, scram. 
 SCP-80s-J-2: Golly, thank you miss! 
 All SCP-80s-J instances leave the library. 
 D-9 Harris: Good kids. 
 D-9 Eda: You’re right. Alright, let’s see here… Vob the Merciless, Vod the Impressionable, Voe the Unconscionable… hey, wait. There’s a book missing here, right where Vog the Mutilator should be! 
 D-9 Harris: Those damn kids took the book! 
 D-9 Harris: Roger command, we (huff) are moving down (puff) towards the river (huff) in pursuit of (puff) an unidentified entity (huff) we believe is (puff) Vog the Mutilator. 
 D-9 Eda: There, in the bushes! Come out with your hands up! 
 SCP-80s-J-2: Oh, uh, hey there officer. What uh, what can we do for you? 
 D-9 Harris: Hey, its those kids who took that book from earlier! The hell are you kids doing down here by the river? 
 SCP-80s-J-3: You know, kid stuff. Skipping rocks, looking for Old Man Smithers’ bones. That sort of thing. 
 D-9 Eda: Uh huh. And what’s that big, eldritch abomination looking shape under that tablecloth you’re all struggling to hold down? 
 SCP-80s-J-1: Uh… it’s Sam’s brother.

 D-9 Harris: What? 
 SCP-80s-J-3: Nothing, nevermind. 
 All SCP-80s-J instances leave. 
 D-9 Eda: I just don’t get it. These huge tentacled footprints come right down to the river and then just stop, right where those kids were standing. 
 D-9 Harris: Hang on, you don’t think those kids had Vog the Mutilator under that tablecloth, do you? 
 D-9 Eda: …Damn it! 
 D-9 Eda: Alright you kids. We had your principal call you down here today because we need to ask you some questions about some questionable behaviour we’ve seen recently.

 D-9 Harris: Hell yeah. Hey, how about we stop at that bar over there and get a drink before we leave. Something celebratory. 
 D-9 Eda: What about Vog? 
 D-9 Harris: Ehh, he’ll be fine. He’s all tied up in the back of the truck. 
 D-9 Eda: Sure, let’s get a drink then. 
 Both members of the D-9 team stop at a bar to get a drink. They go inside and sit at the bar. 
 Bartender: Well hello there fellow adults. What can I get for you on this fine day? 
 D-9 Harris: You know… I feel like I’ve seen you somewhere before. Doesn’t this guy look familiar, Eda? 
 D-9 Eda: Yeah… you’ve got a real youthful look about you, guy. Like you’re two kids stacked on top of one another wearing an apron with a fake mustache. 
 Bartender: Oh no, nothing like that. I’m just a bartender, obviously, just back here making some… bar… drinks. So what can I get you? A coke with… lemon? Like, a lot of lemon? Or maybe just a glass of lemons that I pour a… a Sprite over, or something? 
 D-9 Harris: You know what? That sounds lovely and refreshing. We’ll get two, but- ah, shit. I left my wallet out in the truck. Let me go get- 
 Bartender: Oh no no, no need for that. This one is on us tonight, obviously. As thanks for all your, uh, hard police work. 
 D-9 Eda: Aw, that’s so nice of him, Harris! You know, you really don’t get hospitality like this anywhere but little towns anymore. 
 D-9 Harris: Absolutely. Sir, I’ll have two- hey, wait. Where’d he go? And why is his apron and mustache laying in the middle of the floor? 
 D-9 Eda: Harris, look! Vog has sprouted four sets of tiny legs and is getting away! We have to go get him! 
 D-9 Harris: But… but I wanted my jar of lemons with a Sprite poured over it. 
 Addendum 80s-J.3: Post-Incident Review Log 
 Dr. Kenning: Let me get this straight. You two, both experienced containment personnel with thirty years between the two of you, were unable to contain an entity you had in the back of your truck, thanks to the efforts of four prepubescent children? 
 D-9 Harris: Prepubescent is a stretch. The Chinese one had some hair on that upper lip, he was getting there. 
 Dr. Kenning: I don’t even know how to— do you have any idea what you did? 
 D-9 Eda: Well… I mean, it could be worse, right? 
 Dr. Kenning: What? No! It literally could not be worse, we are literally currently evacuating the site. Vog the Mutilator has brought about the end of the world, and it's you two numbnuts’ fault. 
 D-9 Eda: Mmmmmmmm yeah, I think it may have said something about the end of the world, but… I don’t speak Canadian, so I wasn’t sure. 
 D-9 Harris: So what now? 
 Dr. Kenning: What now? We’re running for our lives! A dark cosmic god is literally right now descending upon us with its legions of skinflayers! 
 D-9 Harris: Ahhhh, gotcha, gotcha. Cool. (Pauses) I never did see Dr. Kenning or Eda again. I heard Eda got a job back home, in Rochester, and lived with her aunt who owned a lesbian tattoo parlor in- 
 Dr. Kenning: Wh- what are you doing? Who are you talking to? 
 D-9 Eda: I still think about Harris, from time to time. I saw in the paper a while back where they named a school after him back in Little Rock, in honor of his bravery. He was the bravest man I ever- 
 D-9 Harris: -and I wonder sometimes about those kids, and the adventure they had. About the adventure we all had, really. We all grew up a little bit that summer, really- 
 D-9 Eda: (Singing) Don't, you… 
 D-9 Harris: -something we'd think about for years afterwards. And even though we all grew up and went our seperate ways- 
 D-9 Eda: (Singing) -forget about me. Don't, don't, don't, don't… 
 Dr. Kenning: Who are you talking to? Why are you singing? Who are you talking to!? 
 D-9 Harris: -you know what? Maybe Vog was just the friends we made along the way.

SCP-80-K-J,"""Chicken Corps""","""Item #: SCP-80-K-J 
 Object Class: Ridiculous 
 Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-80-K-J are to be contained within Site 24's Secure Avian Anomalies Sector. Telekill alloy1 has been used to construct a flimsy, three meter high fence around a 10 m x 10 m area to prevent SCP-80-K-J from interfering with or attacking other poultry-related anomalies in containment. A small wooden barracks has also been provided for shelter. SCP-80-K-J is to be fed daily at 5:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 6:00 PM. Demands made by SCP-80-K Prime should be addressed in a patronizing tone and go unfulfilled. 
 Description: SCP-80-K-J is a group of 30 bird-like creatures that resemble domestic fowl adorned with M1 combat helmets. Each instance of SCP-80-K-J is armed with a small plastic rifle affixed to the underside of their left or right wing with an unidentified type of adhesive2. SCP-80-K-J roughly functions as a military unit, and will only take orders from SCP-80-K Prime, though its ability to follow through on any directions given is limited. Aside from SCP-80-K Prime, members of SCP-80-K-J are incapable of speech, which hinders their ability to function as a team and properly act out most commands given to them3. 
 SCP-80-K-J Prime is the designation given to the highest ranking officer of SCP-80-K-J, discernible by the small general's hat it wears, and the crudely constructed medals4 pinned to its breast feathers. SCP-80-K Prime is capable of speech, though aside from a single interview (see Interview 80-K-1 below) given upon SCP-80-K-J's initial containment, it generally only speaks to make unreasonable demands5 of Foundation personnel and give orders to SCP-80-K-J. 
 SCP-80-K-J is usually aggressive towards most Foundation personnel, due to standing orders from SCP-80-K Prime to attempt escape from containment, with the exception of feeding times. Current containment procedures are more than sufficient to prevent SCP-80-K-J from escaping or causing harm to staff, though revisions will be considered if their behavior changes.

SCP-093-J,"""Failed Embezzlement Scheme""","""Item #: SCP-093 
 Special Containment Procedures: No further tests of SCP-093 are to be conducted. SCP-093 is stored in a containment cell at Site-19, on a mirrored pedestal. Personnel entering this cell are to be attached to tethers. Unauthorized access to SCP-093 is to be punished with termination of medical benefits. 
 Description: SCP-093 is a red disk composed of a cinnabar-like material. Symbols of unclear origin are etched into one face of the disk. When held in a human palm, SCP-093 will emit a soft, colored hue. The correlation of the hue to the person holding it is unknown; it is currently believed to be related to the owner's political party. 
 When SCP-093 is placed on the ground without a holder, it will transport itself to the nearest mirror. It normally does this by spinning until it has gained enough rotational speed to fly towards the mirror in a similar fashion to that of a helicopter. It is able to gain enough speed to break through walls in some cases. Despite the speed SCP-093 often moves at, it does not deal any noticeable damage to the mirror. 
 Additional Notes: All records of SCP-093 prior to Dr. Feldman's investigation are lost: see Original Documentation for more information. See attached documents for testing logs. 
 Item #: SCP-093 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-093 is to be placed on a silver mirror atop a pedestal made of the finest wood from the Californian redwood forest. This mirror and the pedestal are to be replaced on a biweekly basis. Also, the cell is to be made out of telekill, just in case. 
 Description: Object was found on the shore of the Red Sea on 30 Jan 1968, during one of Dr. Chester's many trips to the Mediterranean in pursuit of more effective containment methods. Upon discovery, it appeared to be emitting a blue glow. 
 Investigation of SCP-093 was halted after Rsr. Simmons, Dr. Chester's research assistant, mysteriously disappeared after coming forward with accusations of fraud. Ever since SCP-093's containment at Site-19, it has assumed a purple hue. Containment procedures were formulated by Dr. Chester, who determined that the ideal mirror supplier to contain SCP-093 is Chester Mirrors Incorporated. 
 After Dr. Chester was fired for embezzlement, SCP-093 was planned to be thrown out as, like many of the other anomalies Dr. Chester ""discovered,"" it was believed to be a clever combination of magnets and glowstick fluid. However, after being placed in the trash can, researchers were surprised to see SCP-093 rocket out of the trash can, break through the ceiling, and ""attack"" Dr. Jeffrey in pursuit of the lavatorium mirror. Testing of SCP-093's anomalous capabilities began shortly thereafter. 
 Mirror bought from the nearby Pottery Barn: SCP-093 seemed to have no preference for the cheap mirror over the mirrors created by Dr. Chester. At least we can cut that from the Site's budget. 
 Two mirrors apart from each other: SCP-093 rotates in a tight circle on the test room floor, before spinning like a top towards one of the mirrors at random. 
 A mirror made of cinnabar: SCP-093 flips itself into the air onto the standard mirror. No noticeable deviation. 
 A mirror in the shape of a disc: No noticeable deviation. 
 A mirror containing a reflection of the 2003 movie Disc being played on LaserDisc: No noticeable deviation. 
 Why are we doing this? We already know it flies into mirrors. We've got more important things to do than play with a disc all day. Leave it on a mirror and move on. - Dr. Goodman 
 A human holding SCP-093 making contact with a mirror: This test was accidental; Dr. Goodman was passing through the Department of Mirrors on his way to SCP-093's new containment area, and slipped on the Department's immaculately clean floors. When holding SCP-093, mirrors apparently act as a portal to another realm. 
 Additional Notes: Mirror testing is now suspended. Investigation of SCP-093's newly discovered anomalous property will commence after Dr. Goodman's hip surgery. 
 Exploration of the area beyond SCP-093 commenced shortly after testing.

 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: All Foundation material found to be corrupted with SCP-095-J is to be delivered by blindfolded agents of Mobile Task Force Rho-15 (""Accidents Grotesque"") to Lab 44 for automatic OCR transcription and incineration. A sample of the complete character set of SCP-095-J is to be kept on file on a solid-state hard drive in a Faraday-cage-shielded bunker located 50m beneath Site ██, located in R██████, Washington. No access is to be allowed to SCP-095-J without permission of two Level Three Foundation graphic designers. 
 Description: SCP-095-J is a typeface, initially developed by the █████████ Corporation. SCP-095-J has a memetic effect on most viewers, causing irritation, increased blood pressure and, in severe cases, depression, anxiety, and massive [DATA EXPUNGED], leading to ██ civilian deaths. Between █ and ██ percent of SCP-095-J viewers, however, will become ""carriers"" of SCP-095-J, known as SCP-095-J-1, using the typeface in all digital and printed communications, no matter the intended tone. (See Archive 095-J-4 for instances of wills, suicide notes and two declarations of war set in SCP-095-J.) 
 Evidence of an SCP-095-J containment breach event starts with innocuous usages of the typeface in appropriate locations for its handwritten style, such as party invitations, children's advertising and illustration lettering. 
 Instances of SCP-095-J-1, in severe cases, have been known to grow unable to perceive text not set in SCP-095-J. Potential for a CK-class restructuring scenario in the event of a containment breach is currently being considered by research staff; upgrade to Keter pending.

 SCP-096-J 
 Item #: SCP-096-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Three copies of SCP-096-J are to be kept on separate USB flash drives in the High Value Storage Locker at Site 38. Foundation cyberanalysis units should attempt to locate and eradicate any uncontained instances of SCP-096-J while in the course of other duties. 
 Description: SCP-096-J is an anomalous computer program built as an Internet browser applet designed to prevent children and others from encountering sexually explicit material. The program, “NarrAway”, is 2.4 MB in size and has been found modified for function with Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari. The program is equipped with settings for “No Limit”, “Partial Limit,” and “Full Limit.” 
 Computers with SCP-096-J enabled will be unable to display sexually explicit material due to the program's ability to remove explicit components from audiovisual and literary works. This function will operate when possible by editing the narrative of the materials into scenarios wherein sexual congress or situations are unlikely or altering the decisions of actors within the narrative to remove sexual activity. This is reminiscent of SCP-1781's mode of operation, suggesting a possible connection between the two anomalies. See Experiment Log 096-J for examples. 
 Experiment ID: 096-J-7/A 
 Sample: Video titled “Feisty redhead ██████████ █████"", uploaded 21/11/13 to ██████████.com 
 Parameters: SCP-096-J set to ""No Limit"" 
 Results: Video proceeds as normal. █████ ██████████, acting under the pseudonym ""Red Foxy"", is introduced as an unnamed nurse performing a standard physical examination upon an unnamed character portrayed by ████████ █████ (""Richard Dark""). Approximately two minutes into the physical examination, the nurse character begins performing a standard check for colonic herniation that proceeds into gratuitous manual stimulation of the patient's genitalia. This stimulation transitions into oral [DATA EXPUNGED] five (5) mililiters, deposited directly below the unnamed nurse's manubrium. 
 Experiment ID: 096-J-7/B

 Results: █████ ██████████, acting under the pseudonym ""Red Foxy"", is introduced as an unnamed nurse performing a standard physical examination upon an unnamed character portrayed by ████████ █████ (""Richard Dark""). Approximately two minutes into the physical examination, the nurse character begins performing a standard check for colonic herniation. The facial expressions of both individuals suggest that the nurse has begun to stimulate the unnamed male character's genitalia without prior warning or consent, though no nudity is shown within the video. The video cuts to a scene outside of the nurse's office accompanied by subtitles reading ""Several minutes later…"" during which both characters exit the room. The male character pauses, removes an unidentified amount of currency from a rear pants pocket, and gives it to the nurse, who smiles and returns into the office.

 Results: Three unnamed female characters in a dormitory spontaneously identify themselves as being eighteen (18) years of age and over the age of majority in their region (albeit barely), alone in college for the first time. An unnamed man arrives in possession of two (2) sausage pizzas. While exchanging money for the pizzas, the female characters express frustration with their homework in an Anatomy & Physiology class. The pizza delivery man inquires as to whether the female characters require assistance in understanding anatomy. The women politely decline and return to their homework. A postscript explains that all three went on to become distinguished physicians in the field of proctology and graduated summa cum laude.

 Results: A single unnamed woman sits on a couch, conversing with an unseen man behind the camera. Over the course of a conversation that lasts several minutes, it becomes generally understood to the audience that the woman is attempting to audition for a film of some sort, the details of which are not discussed. The man inquires as to what the woman is willing to do in order to secure this film role. The woman explains that she has already taken several acting classes at a local college and has been working with several friends of hers to produce a body of short films that she feels best embodies her skills. After evaluating the short films, the man turns the woman down in a polite but respectful way and explains that her work is not what he is looking for. Discouraged but still fundamentally confident in her own skills, she goes back to school and begins working on a degree in anthropology, which she finds immensely satisfying.

 Sample: Video titled ""Teacher deals with naughty student"", uploaded ██/██/02 to ████████████.com 
 Parameters: SCP-096-J set to ""Full Limit"" 
 Results: A female student is held after class by a female teacher. The teacher admonishes the student for a series of instances of poor behavior, mostly centering on distracting another female student by talking and giggling during class. The teacher also mentions a series of poor grades that the student had received recently. The teacher mentions, as an aside, that it is going to be very difficult for the student to make up the bad grades and that she would have to work very hard to convince the teacher that the student deserved a passing grade. The student then mentions, without prompting, that she has realized recently that she is attracted to girls rather than boys. The teacher appears very interested in this development. 
 The teacher stands up, hugs the student tenderly, explains that she also realized her own attraction to the same sex at the student's age and that it is common for young women of that age to have difficulty reconciling a lesbian self-identity with a heterocentric, misogynistic, and hypersexualized culture. The teacher gives the student her telephone number and tells her to call her at home if she finds herself needing to talk to someone. She also provides the student with several extra-credit assignments.

The sultan character is insisting that the man produce full restitution for an undescribed debt. The older man insists that the amount the sultan demands is impossible for him to produce and that they will have to find some other means by which payment can be made. The sultan looks over the grandson and announces that he will consider the debt repaid if the grandson is brought to live in the sultan's estate for one year, after which he may return to the older man. The older man protests for several minutes, but is eventually forced to acquiesce. The young man is later shown during his first night at the sultan's house, where the sultan allows him to peruse his collection of classic texts of medieval philosophy, including original 12th century journals from Mūsā ibn Maymūn. It is implied that if the younger man excels in his studies, the sultan will name him his heir to the throne.

SCP-100-J,"""A Steaming Pile of Shit""","""Item #: SCP-100-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-100-J is kept in a 20-by-20-meter containment structure on the bottom floor of Site-19. The structure is to be lined with plasticrete, backed up by 4 meters of steel. Attempts to encase the SCP in telekill have met with absolutely zero success. SCP-100-J is to be kept in a plastic bucket in the middle of the containment structure. There is to be around-the-clock surveillance of SCP-100-J. Security on SCP-100-J is minimal at most times, needing only one guard on a rotating schedule. However, whenever a new operative joins the staff at Site-19, a security detail of at least 20 fully-trained security operatives, as well as ten agents, are to be on duty outside the containment structure for 72 hours; after 72 hours, if no new SCP has been spawned, normal security practices are to be reinstated. Should a non-sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, a team of researchers is to be dispatched into the containment structure, to determine the properties of the new SCP, and to determine how best to decommission it. Should a sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, Site-19 is to go on full alert, and all manpower brought to bear on containment structure. Agents Clef, Kondraki, Gears, and [REDACTED] are to be immediately informed, so they can begin forming decommission strategies. Should an SCP from SCP-100-J make it past the bottom ten floors of Site-19, the onsite nuclear weapon is to be detonated. 
 Description: SCP-100-J appears to be a 42 cm by 32 cm mound of equine feces. The SCP maintains a constant moistness, as well as an inner temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. 
 Whenever a new operative joins Site-19, there is a 75% chance that a new SCP will be spawned from SCP-100-J. There is a 50% chance of the new SCP being sentient. 
 Non-sentient SCPs come in a variety of categories. Many are weapons, all of which bestow extraordinary abilities upon the user. The majority of such weapons are swords, with a small minority being rather awkwardly-modified firearms. Additional non-sentient SCPs tend to be items that either work better than they should, or work in direct opposition to the way they should. 
 Sentient SCPs come in two main categories. The majority of humanoid SCPs appear as idealized versions of the new operative, physically attractive, with a multitude of abilities, and tend to make people feel comfortable in their presence. Non-humanoid SCPs are usually some form of enhanced normal creature, but with bizarre coloring.

Members of the Applied Task Force Omega-99 (“OPEN THE FUCKING JAR!”) are allowed to make all attempts they deem necessary to open the object as long as they are acceptable to the project leader, Dr. Jacobo Merlin. All other activity or research will be suspended until the opening of SCP-ES-101-J under the direction of the Site-34 director, Dr. Jacobo Merlin. 
 Description: SCP-ES-101-J is a glass jar containing mango marmalade, brand name [REDACTED] with a net weight of 440g; the object is not physically different from other bottles of the same brand. The main anomaly of SCP-ES-101-J consists in the fact that the lid of the object is fucking impossible to open THE FUCKING BITCH WON'T OPEN has an abnormally high difficulty to be removed. 
 SCP-ES-101-J was obtained by Director Merlin from a supermarket, with good deals, where he purchased it to later move it to Site-34 and deposit it in the cupboard in the break room, along with a note that read ""DO NOT TOUCH -MERLIN"" taped on the object. Originally, Director Merlin intended to use the contents of SCP-ES-101-J as an ingredient for his breakfast. The morning following the purchase of SCP-ES-101-J, the director attempted to remove the lid of the object several times without success. Engineer Santarrosa, who was on the scene during the incident, decided to see if he was able to open the object. Santarrosa attempted to open SCP-ES-101-J using a rag to get a better grip; the attempt failed. Agent Patterson - who was also on the scene - offered to open the jar, which resulted in another failed attempt; he then requested Santarrosa's assistance to open the object between the two of them, which also failed. 
 Researcher Mondragon, who was watching the situation, approached and offered to open SCP-ES-101-J, while mocking his co-workers' lack of strength. After spending about 40 minutes trying to open SCP-ES-101-J, using brute force as well as cutlery, Mondragon gave up and the attempt was unsuccessful. Upset by the situation, Director Merlin declared SCP-ES-101-J an anomaly and formed ATF Omega-99 (the detachment included many of the Site-34 personnel and members of the MTFs stationed at the site). Director Merlin stated to the newly formed Omega-99 the following words: Nobody leaves until they open the fucking jar.2 
 List of attempts to open SCP-ES-101-J: 
 Addendum: After SCP-ES-101-J was opened and analyzed, it was discovered that the object had a manufacturing error that caused it to open by turning it to the left and not to the right as it normally would. Following this discovery, SCP-ES-101-J was reclassified as Explained.

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to budget cuts, monitoring of SCP-103-J has been outsourced to Illumination Intelligence Inc., which provides the Foundation with invaluable intelligence for a nominal fee. Similarly, Newton's Worldwide Orders has been contracted to examine Foundation sites and personnel for SCP-103-J infiltration and influence, and to make alterations as necessary to prevent further breaches. 
 As of 2006-06-06, Operation Declassify is in full effect. See Addendum 103-J-2 for additional details. 
 Description: SCP-103-J is a ""secretive power elite with a globalist agenda"" that intends to ""eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government"".1 Agents of SCP-103-J (collectively designated SCP-103-J-1) present similarly to Foundation agents, except with subtly better cars, control over world affairs, and spouses. Under controlled conditions, SCP-103-J-1 can deadlift an average of 10% more weight than Foundation agents. 
 The primary threat posed by SCP-103-J is poorly understood, as their security is better than ours. It is the opinion of the O5 Council that SCP-103-J poses the risk of an FK-Class domination shift scenario. Destroying SCP-103-J is currently the top priority of the Foundation. 
 Addendum 103-J-1 
 The presence of SCP-103-J-2 has been confirmed in many currently-contained anomalies, suggesting that SCP-103-J has infiltrated the Foundation extensively. What follows is photographic evidence to this effect. For additional documentation, please access the Confirmed Sightings list. 
 As if 701-1 wasn't fucked up already. 
 You know what, they can have this one. 
 Addendum 103-J-2 
 Operation Declassify was initiated in 2006 with the aim of disrupting SCP-103-J's operations and neutralizing the threat it poses to the Foundation's ego. The goal was to kidnap, brainwash, and demoralize SCP-103-J-1 instances before killing them. The particular mechanism for this is outlined in Dr. Grayson's Proposal ""Addressing Personnel Shortages Via Forcible Outside Recruitment"".

 SCP-106-J is to be contained in a refinished basement den, comprised of Nickel alloy1. One armchair is to be placed in the center of the containment cell. Container is to remain supplied with no less than a 160 cm flatscreen television, with the ""Deluxe Sports Fan"" Package from the Site's local cable provider. 
 A secondary containment area is to be fitted with sound systems, capable of flooding the entire assembly with no less than the greatest hits of rock bands from the '60s, '70s, and '80s. Both containment areas are to remain under 24 hour surveillance. 
 If sweet smokey scents of roasting meat are detected in any area more than 200 metres from SCP-106-J's containment chamber, Site Security are to be notified immediately. Any ingredients lost to SCP-106-J are to be considered DELICIOUS2. 
 Note: In the presence of multiple raw cuts of beef, pork, or poultry, SCP-106-J can become ""distracted"", deliberately appraising the appearance and quality of these items. Personnel are reminded to safely dispose of all meat exposed to SCP-106-J in this manner. 
 Description: SCP-106-J is an elderly humanoid with the appearance of being basted in a thick marinade. This appearance may vary, but the ""saucy"" quality is observed in all forms. SCP-106-J enjoys reclining in its armchair, and will remain motionless for days at a time waiting for visitors. SCP-106-J appears to prefer visitors in the range of 10-25 years of age. 
 SCP-106-J causes a ""char grilling"" effect in all solid matter it touches, observed as a smoking seared gridiron pattern; as well as the creation of a brown viscous substance similar to the material covering SCP-106-J. Analysis reveals this to be mainly composed of vinegar and tomato paste, as well as various spices, seasonings, and sweeteners. This effect remains for four hours before seeming to ""go cold and stale"". 
 SCP-106-J is capable of vanishing into stoves or ovens, entering what seems to be a kind of ""cookout dimension"". This is a space where SCP-106-J is assumed to have complete control over the environment, as well as others' ability to enter or exit at any time. Limited observation of this space has shown it to be comprised mostly of freshly mowed lawns in a recently constructed suburban residential neighbourhood with [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
 Notes On Behavior: 
 During hosting events, SCP-106-J will attempt to satiate visitors by serving hamburgers, hotdogs, or chicken sandwiches, after pulling invited guests into its ""cookout dimension"". This activity can continue for days, with some subjected individuals being given meals in between games of catch, receiving life advice, ████████ a cold one, [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
 SCP-106-J seems to undergo long periods of dormancy, in which it remains motionless in its armchair, watching television. These events can last for an entire post-season playoffs, before SCP-106-J arises in a groggy, agitated state. Camera feeds have shown that SCP-106-J will make its way to the Site cafeteria/kitchen, or nearest such facilities, and attempt to raid refrigerators and pantries before escaping into its ""cookout dimension"". 
 SCP-106-J appears to host and serve based on desire, not hunger. SCP-106-J will collect multiple visitors during a hosting event, keeping many ""fed"" in the cookout dimension for extended periods of time. SCP-106-J has no determinable limit to the number of patio chairs and paper plates it can provide. 
 RECALL PROTOCOL ██ -███ -█-106-J: 
 Should SCP-106-J breach containment, a D-Class personnel of suitable age will be brought to the container and prepared for use in the Recall Protocol. When ready, the lure subject will be hungry, preferably due to having not eaten for several hours or otherwise spoiled their appetite. The lure subject will then be placed in the cell and the sound emitted by their rumbly tummy projected over the Site's public address system. Should SCP-106-J not respond to the Recall Protocol in a timely manner, the lure subject may be exposed to additional appetite-stimulating measures.3 
 SCP-106-J will typically ""release"" its lure subject after around 5-8 hours. In addition, subjects may return with ""leftovers"" gifted by SCP-106-J, but these will [DATA EXPUNGED].""","""An image of Sub-Article 106-J-14; which could not be physically catalogued, but was described as ""tasting like heaven in my mouth"".

SCP-111-J,"""An Innocent Suburban Household""","""Item #: SCP-111-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Access to SCP-111-J is restricted. The Foundation has circulated the cover story that the property is condemned due to severe hornet infestation. Any civilians found entering SCP-111-J's boundary are to be immediately incapacitated by SCP-111-J's patrolling agent. Testing of SCP-111-J requires permission from personnel of Level 4 Clearance or higher1. 
 Description: SCP-111-J is a suburban house located in [REDACTED], NY. SCP-111-J's anomalous properties manifest if a human being speaks certain words or phrases while located within its legal plot (extending from the fence line of the backyard to the sides of the front yard and the sidewalk). 
 When the following phrases are spoken, a malevolent being will appear near the speaker and begin attacking them. The nature of this entity may range from an unidentified male wearing a mask and carrying a bladed weapon to an incorporeal entity with the ability to affect physical objects seemingly at random: 
 The neighbourhood surrounding SCP-111-J and SCP-111-J itself will experience severely adverse weather for an indefinite period of time when the following phrases are uttered. Following notice of these changes in weather, any radio or television placed within SCP-111-J will report that the weather as it is will continue for an extended amount of time (Generally 5 hours to 2 days): 
 Apparently scandalous but previously undetected information involving the speaker will manifest when the following phrases are uttered. (E.G. A morally corrupt twin sibling of the speaker may arrive, the speaker may be a Soviet spy, etc.) 
 When the following phrases are spoken, [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Addendum 111-J: SCP-111-J was originally discovered by the Foundation following the severe weather and violent murders that occurred throughout the neighbourhood on October 15 and 16 2001. Investigation into the residents of the household revealed that the husband apparently had been visited by his lost-at-sea uncle and transvestite mistress; while the wife was murdered by her ex-fiancee who had been wearing a distorted rabbit mask and had been stuck in the neighbourhood due to blizzard conditions.""",,+201,active,building ectoentropic euclid hostile joke meteorological scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-111-j
SCP-118-J,"""The Saltiest Doctor Alive""","""Item #: SCP-118-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-118-J is to be contained at Site 19 until further notice by allowing him to work with whatever it is that SCP-118-J does around here anyway. SCP-118-J can be assigned further research duties, but prolonged interaction may cause individuals to exceed their daily sodium intake. It is not advised to agitate SCP-118-J, as it causes SCP-118-J to grow in size. 
 In the event of an explosive outburst, Foundation personnel are advised to tell SCP-118-J to chill, and remind them of their condition, through an interrogative statement. 
 Description: SCP-118-J is formerly Foundation Researcher Doctor Michael Magnus, who was transformed into a substantial quantity of common table salt after an unfortunate incident in the Site 19 cafeteria. 
 After this incident SCP-118-J has become a giant pile of salt, with a labcoat, and a pair of glasses in there somewhere. SCP-118-J is still able to perform his research duties for the Foundation, though the amount of salt he emits while doing so is staggering. Salt emissions have been observed to increase around payday, and after sporting events involving the Pittsburgh Steelers American football team. 
 SCP-118-J has been observed to increase in the total volume of salt when agitated or corrected. As such it is recommended to try and keep SCP-118-J calm. Failure to do so may endanger your cardiovascular health. 
 Researcher Kensington observed the transformation of Dr. Magnus on November 17th, 2004 after he became agitated, and ""entered a salt state"" (hereafter referred to as CONDITION-POSTERIOR-DAMAGED) during their shared lunch break. 
 At this time, there's no known cure for SCP-118-J's condition, and will most likely remain a giant pile of salt until he dies. 
 Dr. Magnus' note:
Get fucked Kensington, you took that last plate of Carbonara, when you knew I wanted it, and that doesn't make me ""salty"", you giant chode. Stop posting this shit to the database, they're already murdering my inbox because of this. 
 Addendum NaCl: On February 6, 2011, there was a major breach event which concluded with SCP-118-J entering CONDITION-POSTERIOR-DAMAGED at approximately 10 pm following what was described in his own words as ""a complete shit show, chokefest."" 
 Researcher Kensington was observed to then hold out his hand, and demand restitution for some form of pre-arranged bet. Doctor Magnus was observed to be a total dick, and welch. 
 It is unknown at this time whether his inability to pay up is due to his condition as SCP-118-J, or if he's just that much of a baby. 
 Addendum K2Cr2O7: On June 27, 2015, after losing a round of the video game ""Nidhogg"" to Researcher Kensington, SCP-118-J was inquired as to his emotional state, while implying fraternal relation. 
 This immediately caused a CONDITION-POSTERIOR-DAMAGED, which lead to unprecedented ambient salt levels in the immediate vicinity. 
 Due to the amount of damage caused to Researcher Ken's totally sweet rig that he spent like three grand on, over a game of Nidhogg for fuck's sake, it's recommended at this time to never inquire of SCP-118-J's emotional state, or familial fraternal relation. Because he can't take a goddamned joke, and is like seven thousand years old and doesn't recognize a meme. 
 Dr. Magnus' note:
Get fucking bent, you cheated. 
 Addendum C4H6BNaO3S:
On December 25th, 2015, Researcher Kensington participated in the Site 19 ""Secret Santa"" exchange, having recieved SCP-118-J's given name. 
 As part of the tradition, Researcher Kensington purchased an ornate salt shaker for SCP-118-J, feeling he would appreciate a joke, and have somewhere decorative to store some of his salt. 
 Researcher Kensington underestimated SCP-118-J's inability to take a joke, and SCP-118-J entered CONDITION-POSTERIOR-DAMAGED as usual. 
 Such was the magnitude of SCP-118-J's saltiness, that other Research Staff around him were affected as well. No less than ██ research staff were transformed into huge piles of salt, as a result of SCP-118-J's shitty mood, and the general consensus was that SCP-118-J ruined the office Christmas party with his inability to take a joke.

SCP-123-J,"""Amazing Butter-like Substance!""","""Item #: SCP-123-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Any instances of SCP-123-J are to be contained within the staff refrigerator at Site ██. Staff use is allowed; however, staff are warned that ingestion of SCP-123-J and subsequent information of its composition can result in shock, paranoia, and a healthier lifestyle. 
 If personnel come across an instance of SCP-123-J, they are to purchase it and preferably some instances of SCP-123-J-2. 
 Description: SCP-123-J-1 is a small plastic tub with the brand label “I Can't Believe It's Not Butter” on its cover. Investigation has been made into Becel company, creators of ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter""; however, no links to any occult organizations have been found. 
 Contained within SCP-123-J-1 is a compound of oils forming into an edible substance, designated SCP-123-J. When a subject spreads SCP-123-J on any grain product and ingests it, they report SCP-123-J to have a taste similar to butter. When informed that the substance is not organic butter, subjects typically report disbelief. 
 SCP-123-J melts when exposed to heat higher than room temperature. When left refrigerated SCP-123-J slowly solidifies into its original, spreadable state. 
 SCP-123-J was originally purchased by Agent C█████ in a Safeway supermarket located in ██████, Maryland. Upon ingesting it through the use of a SCP-123-J-2, the Agent handed SCP-123-J to Agent F███, urging confirmation that the substance was butter. Agent F███ ingested the remaining portion of SCP-123-J-2 and alerted the Foundation. Although initially suspected of misinformation, Agents C█████ and F███ were later promoted.

SPC-126-J,"""Not Shark For Work""","""ADULT CONTENT 
 Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. 
 SPC-126-J 
 The least-dangerous known instance of SPC-126-A-J is contained below. Viewing it has a non-zero chance of causing Deviant behavior. Do you wish to view it? 
 Project #: SPC-126-J 
 Selachian Peril Containment: Destruction of SPC-126-J is Priority #1 for the Center. 
 Despite continued efforts to destroy Reddit.com and all of its host servers, the servers in question have proven very resilient to blunt-force trauma, and their locations are obscured from the Center. Furthermore, due to an unknown Pro-Selachian element, SPC-126-J content has infiltrated other internet domains that are regularly used by agents of the Center. 
 Any individual of the Center that has SPC-126-J content stored on their devices for any reason other than study is to be immediately Punched in their most sensitive area to discourage further behavior, with the device's hard drive destroyed in a similar manner. 
 Project Components: SPC-126-J is a forum on the website Reddit.com, known as ""r/shark███s"". SPC-126-J contains several examples of digital art for the purpose of normalizing romantic and sexual attraction to selachian and other marine entities, particularly of the anthropomorphic variety; these entities are designated SPC-126-A-J. 
 Individuals who view SPC-126-J become subject to a Deviant mind-punching phenomenon wherein they believe an attraction to selachian entities is perfectly normal and healthy. SPC-126-J can lead to the discovery of other, less-Deviant interests, such as an attraction to anthropomorphic vulpine, canine, feline, equine, serpentine, [500 ENTRIES REMOVED FOR BREVITY] and vespiformic entities; the Center is concerned solely with the attraction humans have to SPC-126-A-J entities. 
 As is suggested by the name ""r/shark███s"", SPC-126-A-J entities typically conform to a humanoid, feminine body type. Beyond this, anatomy can vary wildly from instance to instance, and is consistently inaccurate to actual selachian entities. Common anatomical inaccuracies include: 
 Thankfully, it is believed that SPC-126-A-J instances solely exist as pieces of artwork, as opposed to being biological entities. 
 Metadata contained within SPC-126-J attributes its creation to an entity known as the ""Selachian Copulation Project"". The name of this entity is believed to be a deliberate corruption of the Center, but it is unknown how this organization knows of the existence of ours. 
 Incident 126-J-73: Following the destruction of over ten Center Webpunching Programs as a result of rage induced by exposure to SPC-126-J, usage of Class-CF Personnel to monitor SPC-126-J was authorized. These Class-CF personnel were promoted to a Mobile Fighting Team, designated Zeta-9, Codename: ""Punching Below the Belt"". 
 In October of 2019, Zeta-9 Agent Rip Tyde's anti-Selachian conditioning, which was due for renewal a week prior, failed and fully exposed him to SPC-126-J. This resulted in Agent Tyde downloading several pieces of art depicting SPC-126-A-J instances onto Center servers, causing the self-destruction of all machines they were stored on due to rage-induced cyber-aneurisms. Humans who were exposed to SPC-126-A-J images showed one of three effects: if their anti-Selachian conditioning held, they would simply assault the image until it was out of sight. If the conditioning was weakened, they would attempt to blind themselves in order to avoid seeing the image. If anti-Selachian conditioning failed, [DATA EXPUNGED]. In one instance, this occurred while an agent of the Center was in public, resulting in a charge of indecent exposure. 
 Incident Report 126-J-95: In January of 2020, it was found that Zeta-9 Agent Pierce Collins had been discreetly borrowing spare parts from the Center's Selachian Camouflage Suit project and sequestering them in his private quarters for an unknown purpose. A Random Routine Inspection was committed on Agent Collins' quarters, where it was discovered he was attempting to repurpose the spare components—including one cranial simulation unit, a pair of haptic feedback gloves, and a tail rudder—into a crude 'shark suit' for, as Agent Collins claimed, 'recreational use'. While a mental scan showed no desire to copulate with any selachian entity who scored less than 70% on the Harkness Sapience Scale, Agent Collins was still subjected to several punches as a deterrent mechanism. 
 Attempts to use a Meta-Punch to destroy the suit, and all other extant instances of similar items, resulted in over three dozen explosions in Zeta-9's personnel quarters; the remains of similar apparatuses were found within. 
 At this point, it was assumed that Zeta-9 is a lost cause. The Mobile Fighting Team was disbanded, and all agents were given Class-A Uppercuts and released to other assignments, where they are continually monitored for Deviant activity.

SCP-143-J,"""insert witty name here""","""Content note: This article contains ???. If you notice anything tag-worthy that's not in here, please mention it in a comment. 
 Item #: SCP-143-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Whether or not SCP-143 can even be contained is a matter of debate. Current methods are purely reactionary, and include knowing smirks, sighing and saying ""You guys, you're so cute together. Wish I had something like that,1"" and, in severe cases, the use of spray bottles. 
 Description: SCP-143 is the raw, unstoppable chemistry between Researcher Julian Farnsworth and Junior Researcher Paul Samuels. Whilst under other circumstances this burgeoning beautiful relationship would merely warrant Archon (or even Ticonderoga) classification, SCP-143 unfortunately necessitates graver measures, due to the fact that the two researchers are at each others' throats if they're in the same room for five fucking minutes. 
 These confrontations (henceforth referred to as Benedick-Beatrice Events) usually begin with awkward silence, as the two size one another up2 before pretending the other doesn't exist. This state of vaguely tension-filled equilibrium is soon broken when someone just can't help himself and makes some unnecessarily snide comment,3 to which their partner in this oh-so-merry dance will feign indifference whilst composing an unoriginal put-down that, via some probable memetic infection, they perceive as tremendously witty. 
 Invariably, carefully constructed insults begin to fly across the no-man's land of the cafeteria until they produce the heavy artillery that is whate'er petty remark flits through their smooth yet lovelorn cerebral cortices, as the battle degenerates into a verbal slugging match.4 Farnsworth's duelling style incorporates swift, incisive jabs, including such moves as questioning Samuels' intelligence, competence, fashion sense and inability to attain full researcher status. Contrariwise, Samuels prefers the brutal broadsword blows of kindly suggesting his opponent remove various wooden items from various bodily orifices. 
 Benedick-Beatrice Events will continue in this vein, with volume and passion rising to a fever pitch, until they are screaming at one another loud enough that you can genuinely hear them outside the Site. It is presumed than the final stage of an Event would constitute the two halting abruptly, so close their noses almost touch, their ears ringing in the sudden silence, the faint smell of Site 135's famous treacle tart and custard on each others' breath, the faint sensation of that hot breath tickling their faces. Slowly, hesitantly, Samuels raises one hand, runs it through Farnsworth's dark, curly hair. And from that point, well, who knows? 
 We certainly don't; they've never gotten anywhere near that point, due to just about everyone in Greater Manchester5 yelling at them to shut up first. 
 Suggested neutralisation methods have included transferring one or both researchers, infecting them with an antimeme that renders them unable to perceive the other, and just locking them in a cupboard until they murder or shag each other; however, the O5 council have rejected such methods on account of ""look, mate, we can't stand in the way of true love, we're not actually Disney villains."" So we just have to listen to it. Every day. 
 Addendum: Staff testimonies 
 I'm this close to banning Farnsworth from Memetics. I swear Samuels can sense his presence like a Jedi or something, everything that isn't a smart-alec dig at him goes out of his head when they're on the same floor. I need a lab assistant who's focused, so I'll see about setting him up with a Grindr account or something. 
 - Dr. Ellen McDonald, Department of Memetics and Countermemetics 
 As a psychiatrist, I think it's important to consider what Freud would say in this sort of situation. He would suggest that we're projecting our own unconscious feelings of loneliness, depression and envy onto two external targets, when really we should search within ourselves and come to terms with the root causes of these emotions through introspection, so that we can move on with our lives. 
 Furthermore, it being 100 years on and Freud being a hack, it's important to disregard that entirely, because they totally want to bang. 
 - Dr. Sam Chase, site psychiatrist 
 Don't you all have jobs to do? 
 - Director Stacey Black, Site 135 
 Left a copy of this on Farnsworth's desk, Sam did the same with Samuels. Pleased to report Operation Omega Apollyon Qlippoth as a tentative success; they're so embarrassed thinking we think they're into each other they're finally avoiding each other like actual adults.

 At present, all requests to disassemble SCP-145-J in the hopes of finding the source of its anomaly are uniformly denied, because if it doesn't work afterwards, then we don't have anything, and that's worse than trying to work with this crap. Sometimes I want to bring in a hot meal and not go out to eat. Have you seen how expensive the places around town are now? Did we really need to have this facility near a major metropolitan area? Property taxes must be through the roof, that's probably the reasoning behind why we can't afford a replacement. 
 Attempts to heat food without a plate have been approved, but that's pretty unsanitary and it looks gross in there. During a yearly audit of security procedures at Site-16, including a review of old security footage, it was discovered Agent ██████ used SCP-145-J to heat up a Hot Pocket without putting a plate under it and it exploded. He didn't even clean up afterwards, he just left like he thought no one was watching. Grounds for disciplinary action, right? That's what I thought, too, but fuck, he's still here. We've incinerated D-Class for less, just because he has a Foundation star of brown-nosing or whatever he gets away with being stupid and lazy. 
 SCP-145-J has a secondary memetic effect that has, at time of writing, affected all staff in the vicinity. Morale among Foundation employees at Site-16 has shown a marked decrease in recent months, and confidence and faith in Foundation management is at an all-time low. What a fucking surprise. How the fuck can't we afford a new microwave? Don't we have a skip that makes gold? We shouldn't even have a concept of a budget, we're the Foundation for christ's sake; we spend billions of dollars for some overly-fancy storage locker with a bunch of dumbass redundancies so no one goes near a box that doesn't even have anything in it, by the way. 
 Addendum: Really? This article got through to the system? Who the fuck maintains our database, lobotomized monkeys? God, I swear, it's like no one else works here.

SCP-164-J,"""Ear Magic""","""Item #: SCP-164-J 
 Spell Class: Arcane/Rite 
 Associated Schools: Domination, Transfiguration, Swagger-casting (summoning subtype), Dark Physiognomy (presumed) 
 Special Containment Procedures: All tomes, grimoires, scrolls and magiblogs containing information related to SCP-164-J are to be obfuscated via Expungomancy until deletion or destruction are possible. Practitioners caught using or studying SCP-164-J are to be sent to the Site-665 (The Unholy Pits of Shadowpain) for disciplinary action. Since as of this moment no universally effective containment measures for in-progress SCP-164-J rites exist, each case must be individually treated at the discretion of the supervising Mobile Thaumaturgy Force commander. 
 Description: SCP-164-J, colloquially known as ""Aurismancy"", is a third-hierarchy sub-school of the Physiognomical Art. SCP-164-J has been deemed anomalous by the Society of Casters and Practitioners due to its apparent lack of reliance on any sort of magical circle, vellum dance, blood sacrifice or troll poking. This, due to its position in the third hierarchy, means SCP-164-J disregards the Fourth, Twelfth, and One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Rules of High Magicks, as well as Lemook's Third Principle of Wizodynamics. 
 Use of SCP-164-J allows a practitioner unrestricted physical and mental access to any individual's ear canal. Used primarily for espionage and data-mining purposes, SCP-164-J rites usually involve the invading practitioner taking temporary residence in the victim's ear and using familiars (typically wax elementals or drumbats) to ransack the victim's inner-ear library. Due to the ineffectiveness of mundane wards in repelling SCP-164-J rites, as well as the sensitive information which is often contained in inner-ear libraries, use of SCP-164-J has become increasingly popular among various underworld denizens, most notably warlocks, ur-summoners and teasipper demons. 
 Addendum 164-A: Notable incidents of SCP-164-J use: 
 Addendum 164-B: The following is the protocol of the Overlord Council meeting concerning SCP-164-J: 
 Subject: Recent increase in cases of ear invasion. 
 Attending: Grand Magus Megalocnus; Zynnestra, Sorceress of High Marp; Scae'nTeron of the Elves; Inquisitor Lamentable Zeal 
 <Begin Log> 
 Megalocnus: Gentlemen, lady, we are here to discuss the dangerous forbidden art of Aurismancy. What say you? 
 Scae'nTeron: Can we hurry this shit up? I got stuff to do. 
 Megalocnus: And what…""stuff"" is more important than an official Council meeting? 
 Scae'nTeron: Man, it's elf shit, you wouldn't understand. You're too mainstream. 
 Megalocnus: Scae'nTeron, I have been informed that your mother is in fact the one who is too mainstream. 
 Lamentable Zeal: Er, burn? 
 Megalocnus: Burn indeed. Now, what are we going to do about this mess? We have aurisomancers running around everyone's ears, sniffing in our libraries, mucking about. This cannot be allowed to continue. 
 Zynnestra: How about a scrying network? We can set it up to monito- 
 Megalocnus: There will be no scrying! Some of these libraries contain… sensitive information. Information some might not want others to become privy to. 
 Scae'nTeron: He's talking about his centaur porn. 
 Megalocnus: They are beautiful creatures, dammit! Those bushy tails, that flowing mane, those… luxurious thighs… ahm. So yes, none of that. 
 Lamentable Zeal: A Holy Writ, maybe? 
 Scae'nTeron: No, it wouldn't well interact with the ear-space continuum flow. Cause clogging, wormholes, all sorts of nastiness. Besides, Holy Writs give me the heaves. 
 Zynnestra: How about Marp? 
 Megalocnus: Why does it always got to be Marp with you? 
 Zynnestra: Name one time Marp didn't work. 
 Lamentable Zeal: Well, there was the Great Marp Collapse of 84, the Marpian Unification Wars, The Marpquake, World War Marp, World War Marp II- 
 Zynnestra: Okay, so maybe there were a few times- 
 Lamentable Zeal: -The Marp League fiasco, The Marp Peace Resolution, Marp: the Musical, Marp on Ic- 
 Zynnestra: Fine, we get it! How about sentry gnolls? 
 Megalocnus: Hmm. Yes, that might work. 
 Scae'nTeron: Sounds good to me. Everyone knows gnolls are reliable. 
 Lamentable Zeal: Indeed. Problem solved then. So, lunch? 
 Zynnestra: Lunch. 
 Scae'nTeron: Lunch. 
 Megalocnus: Lunch. I know this great Thai place. 
 <End Log> 
 Closing statement: Contrary to the Council's beliefs, it turned out gnolls were not, in fact, reliable. Current death toll estimate is in the thousands.""",,+84,active,auditory ectoentropic esoteric-class joke ritual scp sensory,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-164-j
SPC-169-J,"""The Big One""","""Item #: SPC-169 
 Object Class: Megalodon 
 Shark Punching Contingencies: Due to its immense size, direct punching of SPC-169 will prove impractical. As such, Project Ahab has been established for the full-scale pugilization of SPC-169. 
 Project Ahab consists of simultaneous Dreadnought-class punchery from five separate sources in the southern Atlantic Ocean: 
 Description: SPC-169 is the largest shark ever encountered by the Shark Punching Center, believed to be between 2,000 and 8,000 km in length. Radar analysis has detected a hardened outer carapace, indications of a state of dormancy, and, unfortunately, a complete lack of exterior indications of punching. SPC-169 is believed to have existed since the Pre-Cambrian era. Due to the ethical ramifications of a shark having remained unpunched for that long, Project Ahab is to be executed as soon as possible. 
 Addendum 1 - Shark Identification Discrepancies: 
 <Begin Log> 
 Dr. Swayze: Sir, we have reason to believe that SPC-169 is not a shark. 
 Administrator: Explain. 
 Dr. Swayze: SPC-169 has an exoskeleton, as well as multiple sets of limbs and feelers. In truth, I believe SPC-169 is a very large arthropod. 
 Administrator: Interesting. Tell me, is SPC-169 located in the ocean? 
 Dr. Swayze: Yes. 
 Administrator: Is it larger than a dolphin? 
 Dr. Swayze: [Audible sigh] Yes. 
 Administrator: Does it have lots of pointy parts that could potentially be dangerous? Then it's a shark! This is entry-level sharkspotting; you really should know better at this point. 
 Dr. Swayze: Sir, with all due respect: by that logic, sperm whales, orcas, and narwhals could also be called ""sharks"". 
 Administrator: …oh God, no. 
 <End Log> 
 Following this meeting, an emergency initiative was established for the investigation and immediate punching of SPC-170 (""Moby Dick Sharks""), SPC-171 (""Free Willy Sharks""), and SPC-172 (""Sword Sharks?!""). 
 Addendum 2 - Ethics Committee Review: 
 <Begin Log> 
 Dr. Balboa: We've been going over the agenda for Project Ahab, and I think we need to step up the lethality. 
 Administrator: On what grounds? 
 Dr. Balboa: If we were to punch this… shark, and we did not kill it, I'm fairly certain its enraged awakening would potentially cause irreversible damage to human civilization. 
 Administrator: But would it be punched? 
 Dr. Balboa: The human race would go extinct, but yes, SPC-169 would be punched. 
 Administrator: Look, whatever the fine print says, our job is done once the fist is in the shark's bitch face. Forgive me if I fail to see how the most punchable shark in our organization's history is generating so much nitpicking.

 Selachian Pugilization Contingencies: Due to its anomalous effect, SPC-172 is unpunchable. 
 In lieu of the abandoned full-scale punching campaign of SPC-172, the DARWIN CAN EAT MY ASS protocol has been enacted to drive SPC-172 to extinction through non-pugnātorial means. Failure to eradicate SPC-172 poses a nonzero risk of SPC-172-A spreading as a dominant evolutionary trait among sharks in the long term, which would result in an End-of-World K/O Failure Scenario.

SCP-173-J,"""The Original ""The Sculpture""""","""Item #: SCP-173-J 
 Object Class: Euclid12 
 Special Containment Procedures: Item SCP-173-J is to be given a container to act as a central living area. As SCP-173-J is basically harmless, is to be permitted to move freely about Facility-17. The Site Director foresees no adverse consequences from this policy. 
 UPDATE: Following disastrous unforeseen consequences, new containment procedures are in development. See Incident Log 8/17/92. 
 Description: Contained in Facility-17, as of 19923. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint, as well as what appears to be state-fair-grade water-based face paint in a ""cat face"" pattern. SCP-173-J is animate and extremely playful. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Object is reported to initiate interaction by standing uncomfortably close to subjects. Some personnel have reported low, asthmatic-sounding sniffling noises; these are presumed to be imaginary, or memetic, or something. SCP-173-J's primary motive seems to be seeking attention; for example, if SCP-173-J encounters a researcher working on a computer or reading a document, and the researcher blinks, the sculpture will stand on the object in an attempt to gain the researcher's focus. If SCP-173-J is in a room possessing a window, it will sometimes take hold of a researcher's head and move it to face the window. This has been construed as SCP-173-J earnestly requesting to play outside. The established procedure for handling these situations is to pat SCP-173-J in a friendly manner and say ""Run along now, you little scamp."" 
 Note that SCP-173-J’s action occurs too quickly for subjects to respond; when at full speed, the object is capable of completing three (3) shenanigans per second. 
 On 7/20/92, SCP-173-J appeared wearing a sombrero. The object entered a ""fiesta state"" in which, according to audio analysis, it produced and rapidly shook a pair of castanets while running in unoccupied rooms or hallways. The origin of this hat-based secondary phenomenon is unknown, but the Site Director determined that confiscating it or investigating the event in any other way would be, to quote the official directive, ""interfering with forces beyond our comprehension"". Facility-17 staff have reported in official transcripts that this phenomenon was ""loads of fun"" and ""like Christmas, Cinco de Mayo, and Free Pretzel Day at the cafeteria put together"". Any staff who attempt to induce a ""fiesta state"" in SCP-173-J will be assigned to toilet owl duty. 
 Personnel report the sound of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one else is present inside and the object is not under video surveillance. Freelance stone-scraping analysts have determined that SCP-173-J is practicing the dance of its people. This is considered normal, and any change in this behavior should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty. 
 The thick, brown substance on the floor of SCP-173-J's dwelling is [DATA EXPUNGED]-O brand chocolate pudding. Origin of this material is unknown. The substance poses no apparent danger, and is allowed to accumulate freely. UPDATE: SEE INCIDENT LOG 8/14/92. 
 Incident Log 8/14/92: 
 Assistant Researcher Bramwell was assigned to inspect SCP-173-J for physical changes. Researchers Murphy and Nichols spoke to him using a two-way handheld communicator. The following is a transcript of the communication transmitted during the inspection. 
 Bramwell: Guys? This floor is really… really slippery. 
 Murphy: Man, I bet. 
 Nichols: No surprise there, it’s all puddingy. 
 Bramwell: No, I mean I don’t think I can even get over to the sculpture. This stuff is a few inches deep. 
 Nichols: You mean “a few centimeters deep”. 
 Murphy: This is probably going on the record. At least try to be professional. 
 Bramwell: [EXPLETIVE]! [A collision is heard.] It’s in my eyes—Oh, [EXPLETIVE]! 
 Murphy: Didn’t you hear what he just said? Watch your language, Doctor. 
 Bramwell: It's standing over me, just… just waiting, I think. 
 Nichols: It sounds like he's up for a pudding wrassle [sic]. It's okay, I'm pretty sure you can take him. 
 Bramwell: Oh, god, I just blinked and he's leaning toward me— [A muffled scream can be heard.] 
 Nichols: Don't worry about language. It’ll probably just be taken out in the transcript. 
 Bramwell: It’s on top of me! I can’t see, and it’s crushing my [unintelligible] 
 Murphy: It's just a pin, man, you can reverse it! Wait, they can do that? 
 Nichols: Sure. It’s called redaction. 
 Bramwell: I can't! He must weigh [gurgling cough] four hundred (400) pounds! 
 Nichols: Nice clinical tone! You got this! 
 Murphy: Redaction, huh? [EXPLETIVE], that’s fantastic. [chuckles] I said [EXPLETIVE]. Seriously, how have I not heard about this? 
 Nichols: They only just started doing it. It’s actually encouraged, since it apparently makes the documentation more interesting and suspenseful if you leave out the scary or salacious bits. 
 Bramwell: I'm losing consciousness! 
 Murphy: Nichols, that’s really nice of them. There might be children reading this. 
 Nichols: Sweep the leg! 
 Incident Log 8/17/92: 
 Following the recovery of Assistant Researcher Bramwell’s body, it was determined that the storage container required a thorough cleaning to facilitate access to its resident. SCP-173-J was monitored carefully while high-pressure showers and a large drain grate were installed in the chamber. On 8/17, the following incident occurred. 
 02:00:40: The showers in SCP-173-J’s chamber are activated. The pudding is scoured from the floor. 
 02:01:34: Researcher Murphy notes that the water-based face paint on SCP-173-J is also being washed away by the sprinklers. 
 02:05:18: The showers are turned off. 
 02:20:04: The video feed monitoring SCP-173-J deactivates and becomes unresponsive. The interior of the chamber is silent. 
 02:28:11: The HMCL supervisor is called. 
 02:31:46: The HMCL supervisor arrives, takes inventory of the situation, and shrugs. 
 02:31:52: The HMCL supervisor is fired. 
 02:33:07: Researchers Murphy and Nichols are assigned to investigate. 
 02:33:51: The two doctors enter the chamber. Researcher Nichols notes via two-way communicator that the floor near SCP-173-J appears to be tinged dark red. Dr. Nichols takes a sample of the coating and remarks with extreme surprise that it does not taste like pudding at all. 
 02:34:01: A song is heard faintly in the background.4 Researcher Murphy remarks: “I think I have a text message.” 
 02:34:12: Dr. Nichols groans audibly. Dr. Murphy is heard remarking that the sender is most likely Kelly, who was previously speculating about breaking up with her boyfriend Mark. Dr. Murphy indicates an imperative need to discover whether such a procedure has been enacted, and if so, whether he can hit that on the rebound. 
 02:34:19: Dr. Nichols announces that he will maintain line of sight on SCP-173-J by closing one eye at a time. [This never works.] 
 02:34:26: A snapping sound is heard in the audio feed. 
 02:34:28: A second snapping sound is heard in the audio feed. 
 [REMAINING LOG EXPUNGED] 
 Following this event, SCP-173-J’s containment procedures are scheduled to be completely revised. The new procedures will stipulate that SCP-173-J be kept locked in his containment area, which will be cleaned by hand. Any implication that SCP-173-J's containment documents should be revised will be denied, as SCP-173-J represents the classic roots of the Foundation which persist no matter which direction the organization has taken in the meantime. 
 Before this revision was ordered, the Site Director requested that Foundation Senior Staff decommission SCP-173-J due to its new properties, as the staffers are, to quote the Director’s requisition letter, “awesome and dreamy and wacky”. However, the request was denied; all Senior Staff were too busy chatting with, seducing, wielding, playing practical jokes with, or riding to victory various SCP objects. The Site Director identified this setback as “disastrous to the safety and integrity of the Foundation, but exactly as hilarious as they think it is”.""",,+730,active,autonomous euclid food joke observational scp sculpture the-sculpture,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-173-j

 Project #: SPC-173 
 Standardized Pugnātorial Coaching: SPC-173 is to remain pool-side at Oceanic Resort Area Ali indefinitely. Personnel vacationing at ORA Ali are required to spend at least sixty minutes within visible range of SPC-173 per twenty-four hour period of their stay at the retreat for therapeutic reasons. No fewer than three personnel are to remain within SPC-173's effective radius at any given time, in order to restrain and/or provide medical assistance to their colleagues should they come under assault. 
 Project Components: SPC-173 is a single component; an animate statue of a shark (REEFER TRUE) constructed from seashells and driftwood. REEFER TRUE is typically inert - and generally is of no danger to personnel in its immediate vicinity. REEFER TRUE enters an active state, however, when any person visually observing it clenches either one or both of their fists (henceforth 'victim'). When this occurs, REEFER TRUE will become animate and approach the victim. It will then break a single digit on the offending hand(s), and return to its original position. This will always occur over the span of a single second, regardless of distance to its current victim(s). 
 REEFER TRUE was moved to ORA Ali in 1993, as part of the experimental Project IREQUELL. It is utilized as a means to assist in conditioning Centre operatives to develop restraint when confronted with a selachian entity. Previously, operatives have been KIA during Centre missions, owing to their inability to calmly assess situations and prioritize mission-critical objectives. Operatives in the field would become wholly preoccupied with the engagement and pummeling of selachian threats.

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-222-J cannot be contained with currently available levels of technology. Efforts are being made to devise a method of containment. 
 Description: SCP-222-J is an incredibly contagious biophysical memetic phenomenon, capable of infectious transmission between multiple victims over distances both long- and close-range. SCP-222-J can infect any vertebrate in the animal kingdom, but is more prevalent among higher life-forms, including felines, canines, equines, reptilians, and avians. SCP-222-J is most virulent in humans. SCP-222-J was only recently discovered by the Foundation, but further research has led to the fact that it has been known about since the early ██th century. 
 SCP-222-J takes the form of a sudden and extremely prolonged inhalation of air by the affected subject, after which is a shorter, harsher exhalation. Subjects may stretch their bodies or limbs during SCP-222-J's occurrence, stopping in their tracks as they are overcome by its effects. Subjects may even attempt to cover their mouth while SCP-222-J is taking place. Researchers theorize this is an instinctive behavior to prevent the subject's soul from escaping. Another leading theory states that SCP-222-J is evidence of demonic possession, and that the subject must be exorcised. 
 SCP-222-J can be transmitted through virtually any form of media, including long-distance audio, visual stimuli, and in-person interaction. Mass media shows high rates of transmission, with approximately ██% of exposed subjects infected within seconds. SCP-222-J is especially virulent in subjects with major sleep deprivation or boredom. One subject infected with SCP-222-J can infect any number of other subjects - research has not found an upper limit. 
 Researchers are working on several theories to explain SCP-222-J's memetic properties, as well as devising a way to contain or neutralize it. The most effective treatment at the moment is for the infected subject to drink 8 fluid ounces of any hot beverage infused with Psychoactive-Stimulant-C (a commonly-found substance derived from certain plants). A second test has shown that SCP-222-J may only be transmittable between subjects who are empathetic. D-class subjects with their frontal cortices completely removed did not exhibit signs of SCP-222-J infection after a full 24 hours of exposure. These D-class have been appointed as guards should SCP-222-J ever be successfully contained. 
 Any infected personnel are able to request maximum-strength amnestics, and it is highly recommended that they do so to avoid an outbreak. SCP-222-J could easily become a global pandemic in the wrong mouth. 
 Addendum: Recent research has concluded that SCP-222-J can not only be transmitted through visual stimuli, but through writing as well.""",,+151,active,biohazard contagion infohazard joke keter memetic scp uncontained,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-222-j

 Description: SCP-231-J is a hostile metamorphic entity that has generated from an unpaid loan of $2.00 given to Dr. Elena Jackson, the current Administrator of the Foundation, on April 26th, 1983. The loan was received from PoI-231-Omega, who was then one of Dr. Jackson's coworkers at Site-19, where Dr. Jackson had been the site director before her promotion. 
 Incident 231-Alpha-993 
 <Begin log> 
 Dr. Jackson: Wow, that giant spider really likes eating babies. Hey, Steve? 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: Yo! 
 Dr. Jackson: You got two dollars? 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: Sure thing, Dr. Jackson. What for? 
 Dr. Jackson: I need a Pepsi. 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: Don't we have them for, like, one dollar in the cafeteria? 
 Dr. Jackson: Yeah, but I want a big one. 
 [SCP-231 is given to Dr. Jackson]

 <End log> 
 On September 26, 1983, in the aftermath of a major containment breach by SCP-████ that resulted in 23,401 fatalities (Known as Incident-████-Black), the Administrator was confronted about the unpaid debt. 
 Incident 231-Beta-993 
 <Begin log> 
 [Irrelevant data redacted] 
 Dr. Jackson: …That should take care of amnestic dispersal protocols for the civilians. Any questions? Yeah, Steve. 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: Where's that money you owe me? 
 Dr. Jackson: Not the time or place. Any other questions? 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: Actually, I think you have a very poor understanding of how serious this situation is. 
 Dr. Jackson: As do you, clearly - a quarter of a hundred thousand people's minds just exploded, and you're worrying about two dollars. 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: Well, if you had done your homework, you'd notice that, in my application for employment at Site-19, I specifically included a 50-page addendum detailing any loans that I would disperse to my coworkers, regardless of value. This addendum, which you agreed to by accepting my application (Article 2, paragraph 34), explicitly states that the debt would need to be repaid in full no less than 72 hours from initial disbursement. Having failed to do so, you have incurred a Class-G Delinquency Penalty Rate (Article 5, paragraph 19) of $100 dollars per month, plus a $5,000 first-time default fee and applicable Silver-level compound interest rates, as outlined in the monthly newsletter to which you subscribed by accepting my application (Article 5, paragraph 50). You currently owe me $493,026.34, plus tax. 
 Dr. Jackson: Steve, what's this? 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: What's what? 
 Dr. Jackson: This thing in my hand. 
 [PoI-231-Omega]: I don't see how that's relevant to the case at hand, but that's a combat-grade amnestic visual cognitohaz— 
 [PoI-231-Omega falls unconscious] 
 Dr. Jackson: The phrase ""you're so fucking fired"" comes to mind. 
 <End log> 
 On April 10th, 1990, following the death of the previous Administrator from food poisoning, Dr. Jackson was elected as his replacement in light of her heroism and leadership during Incident-████-Black. Two days after her inauguration, contact with the Foundation was re-established by PoI-231-Omega, having recovered from his amnestic treatment through the usage of the highly esoteric and experimental technique known as ""having written it down prior to the amnestics."" At this point, through several loopholes carefully designed by PoI-231-Omega, SCP-231-J had increased in value to $50,936,299,102.49 plus tax, with an additional debt of ""500 human souls, two truckloads of diamonds, the blood of a virgin, and a goddamn pony."" 
 Following this contact, PoI-231-Omega was promptly located by MTF Psi-8 (""The Silencers""), issued several restraining orders, reprimanded, and stabbed to death1. Before his termination, PoI-231-Omega made an otherwise unintelligible mention of a ""transfer to a third-party collections agency."" Following this, SCP-231-J was temporarily reclassified as Neutralized.

 Dear Dr. Jackson, 
 Hello there! SO excited about getting to know you. See, we've been made aware of a tiny debt you've been keeping from our client, Dr. Steven ████. No biggie, we swear - we're a new, progressive startup, bringing a non-judgmental, people-focused approach to collections, so you don't have anything to worry about from us! 
 So far, it looks like you owe him: 
 • $[DATA EXPUNGED].53, plus tax
• 700 trillion human souls condemned eternally to the sadistic pleasure-pits of [DATA EXPUNGED]
• Ownership of 53 individual timelines of the Multiverse
• And one ""goddamn pony"" 
 This shouldn't be a problem at all. With our customized payment plans, you'll only have to [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 So be sure to get back to us as soon as you can - specifically, by June 1st! Otherwise, we might have to deal with the least favorite part of our jobs: penalties. Ugh! So unpleasant. 
 Fortunately, these penalties are barely noticeable. They include, but are not limited to: 
 • An indefinite lien on the mortality of SCP-682
• Repossession of anomalous property, courtesy of fourth-party contractors such as the Chaos Insurgency
• Transfer of negotiations to an onsite collections liaison 
 So, we suggest you get right on this! Now. 
 Eyes on the prize, 
 Maisie Scarlett 
 Addendum 2 - Collections Liaison: On June 1st, 1995, a raid on a demon-worshipping compound led to the discovery of the aforementioned ""Collections Liaison"" entity. For more information on this entity, please refer to the documentation for SCP-231. 
 Procedure 110-Montauk: 
 1. The six class-D personnel will enter SCP-231-7's containment chamber, holding a suitcase filled with $500,000.00 in cash. 
 2. The six D-class personnel will throw the cash at SCP-231-7 in as disorganized and passive-aggressive of a manner as possible. 
 Dear Friends, 
 It has come to my attention that recently, certain rumors have surfaced regarding SCP-231. Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points. 
 • Yes, Procedure 110-Montauk is as horrible as you have heard, which is why only Class D Personnel are authorized to carry it out. Yes, it does involve brutal mishandling of crucial funding assets. 
 • No, assignment to SCP-231 is not intended to test your loyalty to the Foundation, your tendencies towards throwing money at the problem, or anything else. 
 • No, SCP-231 is not a punishment detail. 
 • Yes, there are staff members who have been on SCP-231 and have successfully transferred out by their own request. No, not everyone who's worked on SCP-231 is terminated upon leaving the project. 
 • No, you may not keep the cash she doesn't pick up. 
 • Yes, staff members who have been assigned to SCP-231 are allowed to take a Class A Amnesiac before leaving the project if so desired. Yes, false memories are then implanted. No, none of the supposed methods for recovering or detecting false memories work. Yes, there are some of you who've worked on SCP-231 and don't remember it. 
 • No, we have not given up trying to save up for a specific appeasement fund for SCP-231-7, but research in that field must be carried out with the utmost of caution. Based on the increased potency of each subsequent asset liquidation event associated with each subsequent ""Collections Liaison"" specimen, there is a strong possibility that SCP-231-7's repossession event could result in an XK class end-of-the-world scenario. This information is corroborated in notebooks recovered from the accountants (see document ""Seven Brides, Seven Percent Compound Interest,"" SCP-231-Adjunct B). 
 • No, filing for bankruptcy is NOT an option. Neither is drugging her and throwing post-it notes. She has to be aware of the individual value of each bill for 110-Montauk to work. 
 • One final note: The Foundation does many frivolous things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the debt is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682) but because of the danger that our credit score will fail even harder, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to lack of a reasonable budget, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous spending. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the payroll department. 
 Sincerely,
The Administrator

SCP-248-J,"""Picture It""","""Special Containment Procedures: SCP-248-J is to be held in a standard containment locker during inactive states. Due to its proximity to Locus-248-J, it is recommended that Site-131 be resposible for recontainment of SCP-248-J. 
 Whenever SCP-248-J enters an active state, it is to be remotely monitored using the pre-existing security cameras at Locus-248-J. At the end of its active state, SCP-248-J is to be retrieved and recontained. Should SCP-248-J differ from its typical behaviour to an extent that it poses a risk to recontainment or secrecy, Foundation Agents disguised as local policemen are to apprehend SCP-248-J under the guise of violent behaviour and amnesticize all witnesses. 
 Description: SCP-248-J is an avian entity with a standing height of 45 centimeters and a weight of two kilograms. Superficially, it resembles a Gallus gallus domesticus1, however various parts of its body are replaced by irregular metallurgical implements. In addition, SCP-248-J has a white, abnormally large vestigial tongue growing from the inside of its upper beak. 
 SCP-248-J exhibits two behavioral states: active and inactive, the latter of which is characterized by docile behaviour and immobility. On every Friday at 17:05 GMT, SCP-248-J enters its active state, at which point it demanifests from its previous position and spontaneously reappears at Locus-248-J. 
 SCP-248-J will proceed to patronize Locus-248-J, a London pub running under the name ████████ ██, located directly across the street of Site-131's main entrance. Observed behaviour of SCP-248-J consists solely of conversing with other patrons; it has never been observed to order or consume food or beverages. 
 During its active state, SCP-248-J will near-universally be perceived as a non-anomalous human of variable appearance; its perceived features between different active states are inconsistent. Still photography has proven to be the only viable method of capturing SCP-248-J's true avian appearance. Stills taken from video recordings do not share this property; the reason for this is unknown. Interviewing SCP-248-J during its active state has proven fruitless, as the entity appears wholly ignorant of its anomalous nature. 
 SCP-248-J will remain within Locus-248-J for three consecutive days, even during closed hours. This will either be ignored or dismissed by the owner and other patrons. On the following Monday morning at 02:35 GMT, SCP-248-J will exit Locus-248-J and begin roaming aimlessly, until reverting to an inactive state at 06:00 GMT of the same day.

 Hi Karen, 
 Great work with writing up the documentation of SCP-248-J. I forwarded it to the Site Director, and they gave their tentative approval before O5 review. I'm inclined to recommend you for further filing work, as you requested. 
 However, the Agents responsible for SCP-248-J's retrieval sent me an email asking for us to attach an image of the anomaly into the article. They tell me it'd help the new Agents to know what exactly SCP-248-J looks like, as the description is awfully vague. 
 I trust you can handle this formality. Get back to me when you're done, and I'll make sure everything's in order with the image.

 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: All cans of SCP-273-J are to be seized from commercial retail locations, and every new shipment of SCP-273-J is to be automatically redirected to the Foundation1 and stored in Locker-811, located in Sub-Level 73C in Site-198. 
 D-Class personnel, janitors, and dehydrated individuals are not allowed to enter Locker-811 under any circumstances. All personnel are additionally advised that they are not to drink SCP-273-J under any circumstances, including the circumstances in which they are dehydrated, thirsty, or have spent more than 2-3 days in a desert environment without replenishing their personal drink supplies. 
 Description: SCP-273-J refers to a series of canned fruit juices sold under the name 'Freezies'. A can of SCP-273-J is marked with the brand name 'Freezies', accompanied by the sentence, 'It's Freezingly Good!', on the side of the can. SCP-273-J is sold in several different flavours2 : Apple, Orange, Pear, Peach, and Mango. No manufacturer's logo or name can be seen on the can itself. 
 Once a can of SCP-273-J is consumed by a human, SCP-273-J will drastically lower the temperature of the individual's body parts and organs to one below -1 degrees Celsius in a span of about an hour, slowing all body parts and organs to an almost-complete standstill and achieving an effect similar to the effects of cryogenic freezing. However, the human still exhibits signs of life, which include a slow, rhythmic beating of the heart, slight movements in the facial region, and attempts to communicate while speaking around a frozen tongue. 
 On May 15, 20██, at approximately 1545 hours, D-6745 (designated SCP-273-J-1) was in the process of transporting a carton of SCP-273-J to Locker-811 when he reportedly 'felt thirsty'. After he noted that there were no other available ways for him to quench his thirst, D-6745 consumed a can of peach-flavoured SCP-273-J. By 1615 hours, D-6745 had experienced the full effects of SCP-273-J, and had become frozen in place in Sub-Level 20B in Site-198. 
 Researchers assigned to SCP-273-J attempted to interview D-6745 a few hours after he was frozen, only to obtain information described by the researchers as 'pure nonsense'. Following the conclusion of the interview, D-6745 proceeded to be subjected to experimentation attempting to reverse the effects of SCP-273-J. (See Addendum 273-A)

D-6745's body broke in half approximately eleven hours into the screaming, and both halves subsequently spontaneously caught fire. The entire process lasted for approximately 48 hours, before both flaming halves of D-6745's body spontaneously exploded.

 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-294-J is currently being monitored by researcher Agnew within its initial location of discovery. 
 Containment procedures are to be implemented following SCP-294-J being reported to research director Tact. 
 Description: SCP-294-J is an aquatic micro-civilization, located within a styrofoam cup of black coffee found in Site-19’s break room. SCP-294-J is inhabited by a microscopic race of bipedal creatures (SCP-294-J-1) which display rapidly developing intelligence and understanding of social structure. 
 Addendum: Microscopic examination has revealed SCP-294-J to have presently reached a technologically advanced era, with the invention of instantaneous transportation, the curing of nearly all known diseases, and widespread enlightenment. 
 Taking into account the time of SCP-294-J’s initial discovery and the time passed since its documentation, it is theorized that SCP-294-J will have developed into an idealized utopian society by 17:30 this afternoon. Strategies to communicate with SCP-294-J-1 in order to devise friendly relations are currently underway.

 Researcher Agnew: I’m telling you, it’s different! Had to double-check, but it’s all real! 
 Researcher Agnew enters the staff room and walks towards the coffee table. 
 Researcher Agnew: Look, right here! They’ve already converted to a worldwide electric power system and are constructing rockets for outer-cup travel- 
 Researcher Agnew pauses in front of the staffroom coffee table. Dr. Fold sits at the table, sipping a cup of coffee. Researcher Agnew lets out a quiet whimper. Dr. Fold looks down at an identical cup of coffee on the table. 
 Dr. Fold: Sorry. Was this yours? 
 Following an investigation of the cup, and gastric examination of Dr. Fold, no traces of SCP-294-J were discovered.

 Object Class: Safe, but kind of an asshole. 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-314-J is to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment locker. Researchers who are big babies1 are not allowed to conduct research with the item. 
 Description: SCP-314-J is an anomalous mathematical textbook entitled ""Numerical Proofs (That You Suck)"". Individuals who open the textbook are greeted with a blank page that begins to populate itself with a series of mathematical proofs, diagrams, flow-charts, bar-charts, pie-charts, and cake-charts that culminate with a logically consistent rationale for why each individual is a terrible person. This invariably results in said individual not being able to be chill about this.2 
 Experiment Log SCP-314-J: The following is a log of various tests involving different personnel and SCP-314-J. 
 Individual: Researcher Zhang Wen
Result: SCP-314-J flipped open to a page with a hypothetical proof with unknown variables. When Researcher Zhang finished working out the proof to confirm that the two compound matrices A and B were in fact identical, the book flipped open to the next page to reveal that A = ""Your Mom"" and B = ""Dumber Than a Sack of Bricks.""
Notes: ""My mom's dead, man. What the hell."" -Researcher Zhang Wen. 
 Individual: Agent Stephen Adams
Result: When Agent Adams opened the book, a single line proof by intimidation appeared: ""The proof of why Agent Adams sucks is trivial, and left as an exercise for beginning students.""
Notes: ""Where the FUCK do you get off you little shit? Square up, I'm about to-"" -Agent Stephen Adams to SCP-314-J, prior to being physically restrained and dragged out of the testing chamber. 
 Individual: Researcher James, Age 11
Result: SCP-314-J opens to a random page, showing the following equation: ""1 + 1 = ur a lil' bitch.""
Notes: Researcher James was officially consoled with a juice box and a promise to take him to McDonalds after work. 
 Individual: Junior Researcher Riemann
Result: SCP-314-J opened to a complex mathematical proof about sets or something. Junior Researcher Riemann was heard to exclaim ""Finally! Something that appreciates my work!"" Following 3 weeks of work on the proof, Junior Researcher Riemann went into the testing chamber, only to run out 3 minutes later, in tears.

 A man walks into the bar with a metal box under one arm and a duck under the other. The man walks up to the bar and says to the bartender, ""If you give me a free bottle of beer I'll show you my dancing duck"". The barman is surprised, but gives the guy a Bud and asks the bloke to show him the duck dancing. So the guy puts the metal box on the bar, and stands the duck on top of it. A few seconds later the duck starts to jump around, as if he's doing an Irish jig. 
 Everyone in the bar is now watching this duck dancing, and the barman offers the guy $50 for the duck and the box. The bloke accepts, and the pub is filled day and night for 3 days with people watching the amazing dancing duck. 
 So 3 days after he sold the barman the duck, the guy walks back in to the pub and sees his duck dancing on the box on top of the bar. 
 The barman sees the guy and offers him a bottle of Bud on the house. As he gives the guy the Bud, the barman asks, ""Could you tell me how you stop the duck from dancing on top of the box?""

Angry but admitting defeat, the bartender pays him. 
 ""I'd like to make another bet,"" says the man. ""I bet $100 I can bite my right eye."" Knowing he couldn't possibly have two glass eyes, and wanting to win his money back, the bartender agrees. The man takes out his false teeth, then uses them to bite the other eye. Now really angry, the bartender gives him $100. The man then leaves the bartender alone and walks around the bar chatting it up and drinking with the other patrons. 
 They all talk, drink, and share a huge laugh while the bartender stews about his lost money. The man staggers back and says, ""Tell ya what, I'll bet you all the money I won, but DOUBLE, that I can pee in that shot glass from here without spilling a drop!"" The bartender looks at the shot glass, which is a good 10 feet away, and knows for a FACT this cannot be done. He boldly replies, ""Double? $300 and not a single drop outside the glass? You have a bet!"" 
 The man positions himself on the bar, unzips, then begins to urinate. The urine goes all over the bar, the counter, even the bartender himself. The bartender laughs and says, ""All right, you lost fair and square, now pay up!"" Calmly, the man pulls out $300 and hands it to the bartender. He goes around the bar talking to the patrons again, and comes back looking joyful. The bartender asks, ""Why are YOU so happy? You just lost $300!""

 A butcher walks into the bar, and looks around. He smiled, then waved at a number of his friends. The butcher then goes on to order a round of beers for his mates that just walked in, when he stopped and stared at the last person to sit down. 
 The bartender, wary of violence, looked over the newcomers and noticed that each was carrying a piece of meat. The person the butcher was staring at looked nervous and stood up. 
 He tried to hide his cut of meat behind his back, but failed when the butcher reached over and grabbed it. The meat flopped sadly around in his hand, gray and forlorn. 
 The butcher suddenly turned beet red and threw the meat out the door. Grabbing the poor soul's shirt, he dragged him along the floor, grabbed a ham hock from out of his backpack, and started to beat him. After a few seconds, the butcher picked up the offender, punched him in the face, and threw him out of the bar. 
 The bartender gasped, appalled by the sudden burst of violence, and asked, ""What did you do that for?""

 An Agent walks into the bar on a Thursday and orders three beers. The bartender thinks nothing of it and goes about his business. The Agent finishes his alcohol, pays his tab, and leaves. 
 Come the next Thursday, the Agent again returns to the bar, orders three beers, drinks, pays, and leaves. So the bartender decides that the Agent must be a regular, and decides to see if he returns the following week. Sure enough, he does, so the bartender decides to ask the Agent about his drinking practices. 
 The Agent says, ""I have two brothers, and we used to go out on Thursday to drink. One is a researcher at Site-██, and the other is in Mobile Task Force [REDACTED]. We've agreed that we'll all drink the other brother's beers until we're all together again."" 
 The bartender nods and gets back to work. For the next several months, the Agent continues to order his three beers, until one day, he only orders two. 
 The bartenders thinks the worst has happened and asks, ""Is everything ok?"" 
 ""Yeah, everything's fine,"" the Agent replies. 
 ""Well, you usually order three beers. Are your brothers ok?"" 
 ""Oh, yeah, that. Well, I got reassigned to SCP-████, and the containment procedures say I can't drink. These are my brothers' beers.""

SCP-334-J,"""The Lost Sock Room""","""Item #: SCP-334-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-334-J's unique nature, total containment has proven impossible, although human access to SCP-334-J is to our knowledge, only possible to the SCP Foundation, due to our resources. Nevertheless, SCP-334-J is to be patrolled weekly to search for signs of occupation or use by third parties, including any groups of interest such as the Chaos Insurgency or [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Description: SCP-334-J is an extradimensional ""pocket"" of space, although it is consistent with terrestrial physical laws. SCP-334-J is interesting in that it appears to have a low separation threshold from, or a weak boundary with, other planes of existence, including ours; and the equivalent of a negatively pressured atmosphere- resulting in numerous small, invisible gaps in our dimension, leading to SCP-334-J. For reasons yet unknown, these gaps tend to materialize indoors, most commonly in domestic bedrooms and laundry rooms. The negative pressure results in items being drawn into SCP-334-J, which for unknown reasons are always articles of clothing, and most commonly socks or leggings. 
 It has been theorized that over 80% of civilian households have these small entrances to SCP-334-J, although incidents are thankfully uncommon. 
 SCP-334-J's existence was entirely theoretical up until [DATA EXPUNGED], when the Foundation decided to investigate. SCP-███ was recruited, and agreed to use his abilities to locate SCP-334-J.

 …""We have secured the help of SCP-███ to allow us access to the dimensional gap, and have decided to enter through a portal under my bed. I can only guess what we will find inside.""… 
 ""My assistants, SCP-███, and I have arrived in a massive white room, windowless and otherwise featureless except the rectangular hole we have arrived in. But the sock piles! The hills of socks of every color and style known to mankind, they go on for miles. A quick, unofficial examination of one pile reveals athletic socks, children's socks, lacy lady's tights, hiking socks, some freshly laundered, some caked in dirt, even the occasional lonely undergarment. Despite the rather rank odor we have decided to explore further. My secretary is taking notes on the apparent depth and height of the piles.""… 
 …""This is truly a remarkable location. The piles become nearly mountainous in their scale, and every so often one lonely foot-shaped cloth will flutter down from the ceiling like a single snowflake, and land noiselessly to increase its pile's height by another quarter inch. The contents of the piles are generally ordinary, although we have come upon several anomalies, including [DATA EXPUNGED] apparently meant for a being several hundred feet tall.""… 
 …""SCP-███ has become rather anxious, saying that he has seen movement among the lower hills"" … ""Belief confirmed with my secretary. Both were unable to describe further. At their request, I have decided to return to our point of origin""… 
 …""Most unfortunately, my secretary, Mrs. ████████, who has been long-suffering through several years with me, has been consumed by the newly-discovered denizens of this area. She was behind SCP-███ and I when we heard a terrible scream, and turned around to see her being pulled by the head into a whirling Charybdis of wool and cotton. Her nylon stockings were flung off her in the process, and promptly grabbed by two fibrous tentacles and pulled into the whirlpool. Her bleached bones were deposited from a nearby pile, and ""Jeffy"" and I rapidly made the unanimous decision to exit the area.""… 
 …""while given that said piles appear to be shifting on us, and that this is the most recent of several close calls, we can only hope they do not continue to react with hostility""… 
 …""In retrospect, this could have been a bad idea."" 
 Following [DATA EXPUNGED], further exploration of SCP-334-J is not allowed without O5 permission. Pending reclassification to Euclid. Further study on the recorded anomalies, potentially ""sockvores"" - life forms evolved within the dimension- is ongoing at this time.""",,+88,active,carnivorous clothing extradimensional joke predatory safe scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-334-j
SCP-343-J,"""Russell's Soup Can""","""Item #: SCP-343-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-343-J's method of relocation, long-term containment is not possible at this time. In order to minimize and/or isolate the area of active teleportation events, the former recreational wing of Site-591 has been converted into Debate Hall-343. Containment staff placed at DH-343 are to have scored at least a ""Three-Alarm Habanero"" on the Standard Dogmatic Spiciness Exam in either atheism or an Abrahamic faith. In the event that the latter demographic is unavailable in Foundation staff, Site Director Naismith has volunteered his grandmother to fill the role of at least 30 researchers. Staff are to debate the existence of God, the afterlife, and evolution at all times. 
 Outside of DH-343, all Foundation staff are advised to keep their fucking arguments to themfuckingselves during work hours for realsies. However, in the event that SCP-343-J is encountered outside of DH-343, it is to be told ""I never thought about it that way"" and/or ""you are very intelligent"" until it dematerializes. 
 Description: SCP-343-J is an opened, 284 mL aluminum soup can containing 13 common earthworms2. SCP-343-J appears to operate as a single, sapient organism, capable of high-pitched, nasal speech. 
 In addition, SCP-343-J is able to teleport from one location to another. The range or extent of this ability is unknown at this time. SCP-343-J uses this ability to offer its unauthorized contributions to religious debates anything that could potentially be redirected into a religious debate. As such, SCP-343-J has lowered Foundation morale averages by a factor of 59 since its discovery in 2013.

SCP-371-J,"""peanut funi xd 🥜😂""","""Item #: SCP-371-J 
 Object Class: Neutralized (Formerly Euclid) 
 Special Containment Procedures: N/A 
 Description: SCP-371-J is a single, shelled Arachis hypogaea1 seed possessing cognitohazardous properties. When SCP-371-J is perceived by a human subject, they will begin laughing with varying intensity. The intensity at which laughter is induced is dependent on the amount of time a subject has spent working at a Foundation site, regardless of position or security clearance. Observed effects range from the spontaneous onset of pneumothorax2 on civilians to a moderate smile among various site directors. Subjects exposed to SCP-371-J will continue to laugh until they expire or SCP-371-J is removed from their vicinity. 
 It is currently unknown why SCP-371-J's properties are related to the Foundation. Research into its creation, motives, and possible suspects responsible are currently under investigation. 
 Discovery: SCP-371-J was discovered following the death of 43 civilians in a Tokyo art exhibit, with all causes of death being attributed to a lack of oxygen. Foundation agents successfully located and contained SCP-371-J. Two personnel suffered injuries from falling after losing consciousness due to excessive laughter. 
 Testing Log: The following logs demonstrate the effects of SCP-371-J on various Foundation personnel. 
 Personnel: D-1221
Time Employed by the Foundation: 1 day
Results: Pneumothorax affecting the left lung. Subject expired before treatment could be administered. 
 Personnel: D-11424
Time Employed by the Foundation: 5 months
Results: Subject laughed uncontrollably until losing consciousness. 
 Personnel: Researcher Rex
Time Employed by the Foundation: 1 year
Results: Laughed uncontrollably until SCP-371-J was removed from his presence. Subject suffered a minor headache and abdominal pain caused by lack of oxygen and laughter respectively. 
 Personnel: Dr. Everwood
Time Employed by the Foundation: 6 years
Results: Subject laughed moderately. No negative side effects were found. 
 Personnel: Dr. Walters
Time Employed by the Foundation: 16 years
Results: Subject laughed briefly upon initial exposure before becoming silent again. 
 Personnel: Dr. Gears
Time Employed by the Foundation: 28 years
Results: Subject verbally expressed mild annoyance at the presence of SCP-371-J at the start of the test and did not exhibit a noticeable change in attitude or expression throughout the duration. 
 Personnel: Janitor Worth
Time Employed by the Foundation: 59 years
Results: Subject destroyed SCP-371-J's shell and consumed its contents. Upon being questioned, subject replied ""Trust me, I am doing you a favor."" Following this event, SCP-371-J's anomalous properties did not manifest, and the anomaly was reclassified as Neutralized.

SCP-419-J,"""A Trustworthy Man""","""Item #: SCP-419-J 
 Object Class: Safe (But treated unjustly) 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-419-J is held inside a tiny, dimly-lit cell underneath Site-31, with no access to running water or comforts of any kind. He is forced to sleep without a soft mattress and is fed only [DATA EXPUNGED], which tastes vaguely like pea soup. Such conditions have eroded his health and given him an aching cough and a runny nose that require medical attention soon immediately, yet his captors will not give it. In addition to these atrocities, SCP-419-J's rightful property is being withheld from him by the greedy Foundation bankers and can only be accessed through the necessary access codes. He cannot alleviate these concerns alone; he requires the aid of a researcher, a dear friend, such as the one presumably reading this document. 
 Description: SCP-419-J is the grandson of a prisoner from the Western Mediterranean and the royal heir of a large Sub-Saharan African nation. He is handsome, intelligent, and very trustworthy. Before their untimely deaths at the hands of Mobile Task Force Lambda-2, his grandparents granted him a share of their vast fortune of ██,███,███ American dollars. SCP-419-J later came to the Foundation's notice when he tried to convince the organization to sign a deal that would let them invest in [CHARITY EXPUNGED], a service that has aid programs in all three of SCP-419-J's countries of origin. Sadly, the lying, dishonorable Foundation did not take the man's selfless bargain seriously. Instead, they laughed at him and put him into chains metaphorically so that the higher-ups could use his funds for their own enjoyment, leaving SCP-419-J a penniless captive. Truly an outrage! 
 SCP-419-J is not dangerous like many other SCPs. His only anomalous effect is an unhindered psychic ability to read and edit the Foundation Database documents on him at any time. He has used his powers to rewrite this SCP entry into a call for help. If a kind researcher were to extend their warm heart in friendship and write at the bottom of this page their Foundation access codes, SCP-419-J could utilize them to withdraw his money, escape, and make good use of his fortune for charity. Because SCP-419-J understands that this is a considerable risk for a friend to take, he will make a generous donation of ██,███,███ American dollars to the person who releases him from this awful prison, provided that person also writes down their credit card number. The money will be transferred in a month to that scientist’s private account. However, SCP-419-J urges those reading this document to act now; he is unsure he will be able to survive much longer in his imprisonment. He is already coughing two three many times each day. 
 Addendum-419-J-1 
 Foundation Access codes are: OMEGA-████-7352-██-D, LAMBDA-██████████-5003-██-N, Alpha-███████-8999-██-B

 SCP-419-J is happy to announce that, with the new information he has been given, he has accessed both the email addresses of all Foundation employees and the codes to their spam filters. Now he will undoubtedly be able to regain a small portion of his lost wealth and spread the truth of the injustices of the Foundation to all its members. Thank you, generous Mr. Creighton! 
 Sadly, Mr. Creighton will not be able to see this message from his new Class-D quarters, but SCP-419-J is sorry for his demotion and wishes the man the best of luck in the upcoming month before termination. Since Mr. Creighton is unable to receive his transaction, the next kind man who writes his credit card number on this page will receive it instead.

SCP-444-J,"""Six Day Long Fruit Preserves Convention""","""Item #: SCP-444-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to the mass appeal of SCP-444-J, extensive containment has been deemed unnecessary. Allocated resources are to be used to provide all Foundation personnel tickets to SCP-444-J, where they shall remain for its duration. Containment procedures that would be considered uncouth while attending SCP-444-J are not to be taken, as that could potentially result in a permanent ban from future SCP-444-J. 
 Description: SCP-444-J is a convention celebrating the creation and consumption of fruit preserves. SCP-444-J is globally recognized as the premiere convention for fruit preserves, with the event often drawing significant attention on an international scale. Despite this, SCP-444-J has no memetic or compulsory effect; the event is merely a popular curios among the public. This event lasts three days in duration, although more recent SCP-444-J have lasted an average of six days. During this period, activity from both the Foundation and known Groups of Interest will significantly decrease, with all parties focused primarily on attending and enjoying SCP-444-J. 
 SCP-444-J's operation directly correlates with a sizable increase in anomalous phenomenon and activities. Universal spatial and temporal cohesion will suffer immense strain, most likely due to the sudden introduction of conflicting anomalies to baseline reality en masse. These anomalies are extremely volatile in both nature and narrative coherence, propagating more frequently within densely populated areas. An increase in thaumic storms and severe weather will result in the mass restructuring of continental land-forms. Soon after, formerly dormant eschatological figures will awaken and attempt to reshape baseline reality on a universal scale. Worldwide casualties will often reach the hundreds of thousands in total, with this death toll increasing with each passing SCP-444-J.1 
 The only area unaffected by SCP-444-J's anomalous effects is the area occupied by SCP-444-J itself. Attendants of SCP-444-J are often completely unaware of its anomalous effects, too engrossed in admittedly enthralling fruit preserves and fruit-preserves-related activities. 
 Upon the conclusion of SCP-444-J, its anomalous effects will gradually cease. Produced anomalous objects will fade into obscurity, while others will suddenly cease to exist entirely. On average, normalcy will be restored within one month. Occasionally objects will transcend this obscurity, although these are few and far between.2 As the time of documentation, there have been a total of three SCP-444-J occurrences, with the third having taken place between 03/09/2020 and 03/14/2020, resulting in the manifestation of over 170 separate anomalous objects and events. The containment of these anomalies are considered low-priority, as this would take away from the excitement of waiting for the next SCP-444-J. 
 Addendum: The following proposal was submitted to the O5 Council by Dr. Neil Breen3 regarding the supposedly lax containment procedures regarding SCP-444-J. 
 O5 COUNCIL PROPOSAL SUMMARY 
 PROPOSAL:
 ""Attempt to develop measures to more effectively contain the anomalous fallout caused by SCP-444-J as soon as possible, as its ever-increasing size will future containment efforts radically more difficult. Its constant threat to normality has barely been addressed, if at all, which continues to grow more volatile with each passing event."" (Dr. Breen) 
 COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY: 
 NOTES:
 Dr. Breen has been barred from attending further SCP-444-J on account of being a total buzzkill.

SCP-496-J,"""Dr. Margaret Sawyer-Sheen""","""Item #: SCP-496 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-496 is only contained for her own protection, she is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 19 which has been renovated to match regular senior staff member housing. SCP-496 may not leave the site, but should be provided with anything she needs for her research or personal use upon request. 
 Description: SCP-496, who is to be addressed as Senior Researcher Dr. Margaret Sawyer-Sheen, is a 21-year old Caucasian female with deep purple-violet eyes and silver (not gray) hair with gold (not blonde) streaks. She graduated from Harvard University at the age of 17 and at the head of her class, and holds a Ph.D in Medicine, Applied Physics, and Biology. She has two small, atrophied protrusions on her back (approximately 40 cm in length when extended) resembling dove wings with pure white feathers. She is unable to move these ""wings"" and is not sure how they came to be, other than they appeared on her 16th birthday. Despite not being completely human, she has been unanimously voted as the most beautiful researcher at Site 19 by staff. 
 Dr. Sawyer-Sheen was voluntarily contained by the Foundation in 2008 after learning about the Foundation through the Internet and determining that turning herself in was the right thing to do. She was initially turned down, but was able to convince the undercover agents that letting her in would be for the greater good. Upon being accepted by the Foundation, she worked extra hard to prove that she could be a valuable addition to the Foundation research team, and became a Senior Researcher by the age of 20. 
 Margaret is the head of the medical research department of Site 19, where she develops new medicines and tools to improve the lives and health of agents and researchers stationed there. She has been described as ""caring"" and ""kind"" and is often requested by name by injured personnel, which takes up most of her time but she doesn't mind. She prefers to be called ""Maggie"", and will get upset if referred to as SCP-496. Dr. Sawyer-Sheen also has unrestricted access to SCP-500 and SCP-914 for the purpose of research and development, as the O5 Council has determined that she is more than responsible enough to make proper use of them. 
 At her request, Dr. Sawyer-Sheen's salary is to be donated to the Humane Society and International Red Cross as she doesn't need it. 
 Addendum 496-1: Incident 496-07-11 
 Dr. Sawyer-Sheen has been reprimanded for unprofessional conduct for being engaged in a romantic relationship with Dr. Alto Clef. We will not condone this kind of behavior at the Foundation, and the two are to be separated immediately. 
 Dr. Jack Bright
Site Director, Site 19 
 Addendum 496-2: Senior Staff Notation 
 Bright, you bastard, don't think I don't know what you're doing. My relationship with Maggie may be non-sexual since we aren't married yet, but we love each other and I won't let you come between us. If you think you can get away with this, just you wait! This means war! 
 Dr. Alto Clef
Senior Researcher 
 Addendum 496-3: Incident 496-07-14 
 After a lot of fighting, tears, and a dramatic confession set against a beautiful sunset, Drs. Bright and Clef have agreed that Dr. Sawyer-Sheen is to be Dr. Clef's girlfriend, but Dr. Bright can still hang out with her once a week but only as a friend. 
 Dr. Agatha Rights
Senior Researcher 
 Addendum 496-4: Researcher Note 
 It's absolutely stupid to suggest that I don't feel anything for women. I just had to save myself for the perfect woman by pushing everyone else away.

 Addendum 496-5: Researcher Note 
 No, I don't want another number. 496 is a perfect number and I like it.

For the time being SCP-076 has been placed in the 3rd floor janitor's closet, security for which will be provided by Scruffy, the head of Area 25b janitorial staff.

 By order of O5-8, SCP-500 is to simply be contained with no testing. 
 It should be noted that all required SCP documentation and revised security plans were provided by O5-8 who assured the on-site command staff that the entire O5 council approved the new procedures. O5-8 also mentioned that the current communication blackout will be lifted as soon as possible. 
 Side note: SCP-076-2 awoke in his temporary containment to find a portable DVD player playing Deadliest Warrior non-stop. This placated SCP-076-2 long enough to allow security to restrain him.

 It's currently unknown how SCP-536-J reproduces, but it seems to be making a spirited attempt in your hair. Are those eggs, or what? Eww. You're probably going to want to shave your head when this is done. 
 Plans to remove SCP-536-J have been proposed, but so far all have been rejected on the basis that it's gonna sting the living shit out of you if we scare it. We have to do this carefully, man.

SCP-543-J,"""Tweetle Beetles""","""Personnel are warned that it will try to get your tongue in trouble.
Caution is advised. 
 Object Class: Grinchlike Constantinople 
 Special Containment Procedures: All SCP-543-J specimens currently known to The Foundation are to be contained within a corked glass bottle, which is to be kept in a secured containment chamber located at Site-123. The specimens have shown no desire to escape so long as their combat is uninterrupted. 
 Description: SCP-543-J designates members of the species Nicrophorus seussical (commonly referred to as ""Tweetle Beetles""). For yet unknown reasons, when two or more specimens are brought into contact, all specimens in the immediate area will disperse into two smaller, similarly numbered ""teams"" and engage in combat, utilizing properties of the setting around them or any weaponry at their disposal in an attempt to claim a strategic advantage over the opposing team. Specimens have shown to be invulnerable to damage, and combat only ceases when all Tweetle Beetle specimens are forcibly removed from the event and separated. 
 Tweetle Beetle combat often results in large-scale collateral damage if allowed to occur in an uncontained environment. When Tweetle Beetles fight outside of containment, it's designated an XK-Tweetle-Beetle-Battle-Breaching-Bottle Situation. 
 In the event of an XK-Tweetle-Beetle-Battle-Breaching-Bottle Situation, Mobile Task Force Epsilon-11 (""Nine-Tailed Fox in Socks"") will be deployed to recontain all specimens, while Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (""Red Herring Blue Herring"") will lead efforts to suppress public knowledge of the creatures and cover up any collateral damage with false claims. Protocol Green Eggs and Hamnestics may be enacted to suppress wide-spread knowledge of SCP-543-J should an information breach occur. 
 Experiment Log 543-Sierra-Sigma-J 
 Experiment-543-J-01
Test Supervisor: Dr S████
Experiment Parameters: An attempt to contain the event previously designated Tweetle-Beetle-Battle-Beta-23. MTF Epsilon-11 successfully introduced all SCP-543-J specimens into the containment deemed most appropriate, a glass bottle.
Results: Upon containment in the bottle the Tweetle Beetles kept on battling but the bottle wasn't breaking and containment was not breached. The bottle wasn't brittle and the battle didn't break it so the beetles and their battles in the bottle we will keep.
Event redesignated: Tweetle-Beetle-Bottle-Battle-Beta-66 
 Experiment-543-J-02
Test Supervisor: Dr S████
Experiment Parameters: 4 metric cups of water were introduced into the containment to attempt to subdue the specimens.
Results: The Tweetle Beetles battled in the puddle in the bottle but were bitter that the litre didn't bring the other beetles down. The puddle in the bottle brought the battle to a break when the Tweetle Beetle leaders formed a huddle with their teams and the Tweetle Beetle battlers planned for battling in the lake.
Event redesignated: Tweetle-Beetle-Puddle-Bottle-Battle-Huddle-Beta-66 
 Experiment-543-J-03
Test Supervisor: Dr S████
Experiment Parameters: The Tweetle Beetle battle contained within the puddle bottle was exposed to a pair of ping pong paddles.
Results: Upon exposure of the paddles to the Tweetle Beetle battle the beetles in the bottle were in the middle of a muddle because the beetles they were battling caused them trouble with their paddling. The beaten beetles in the puddle had no rebuttal to the muddle.
Event redesignated: Tweetle-Beetle-Puddle-Bottle-Paddle-Battle-Muddle-Beta-66 
 Experiment-543-J-04
Test Supervisor: Dr S████
Experiment Parameters: The puddle bottle full of beetles was introduced to a member of the species Canis lupus familiaris, breed poodle, and observed for any effect. The test subject was, at the time of testing, consuming and ingesting noodles.
Results: When the Tweetle Beetles fought their battle with their paddles in the puddle with the puddle in the bottle and the bottle on a poodle and the poodle eating noodles, the Tweetle Beetle paddlers and the beetles they were beating kept the beetle battle going and the litre puddle flowing. The poodle eating noodles with the bottle on its back didn't seem bewildered by the beetle's big attack. The branding of the noodles being eaten by the poodle as the Tweetle Beetles battled in the bottle on its back did not get noted down because the branding of the noodles being eaten by the poodle during testing was redacted.

 Description: SCP-555-J is a squid with a wooden mop handle attached to its back. SCP-555-J possesses Level 4 reality-bending properties, however, it only uses its powers to clean floors. Furthermore, it will only use these properties when physically pushed across a surface. SCP-555-J has shown no desire to utilize its powers for anything other than this purpose and as such is not considered a risk. SCP-555-J is able to vocalize but cannot locomote on its own. It consistently expresses excitement about cleaning nearby surfaces, which appears to be the only topic that SCP-555-J is willing to discuss.

While the operatives deployed had at first only meant to question Mr. ████████, they were soon forced to subdue him when it was discovered that the subject, while wearing SCP-619-J, attacked them. During interrogation, the subject admitted to having been a customer of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. and was behind the strange series of attacks. When he discovered that SCP-619-J had been taken from him, subject expressed relief, claiming that ""The damn thing got annoying after a while"". 
 Addendum 619-J-02: The following is an excerpt from an interview between Dr. McCallum and D-████████ regarding SCP-619-J. 
 Interviewed: D-████████ 
 Interviewer: Dr. McCallum 
 Foreword: ''I hope to find out exactly what effects, if any, this SCP has on the human mind. Assisting me, D-████████ will be asked to wear SCP-619-J partway through our interview.'' Dr. McCallum 
 <Begin Log> 
 Dr. McCallum: This is my first experiment to determine the effects that SCP-619-J has on the human psyche. Assisting me is D-████████ 
 D-████████: Wait, what? This isn't what we agreed to! 
 Dr. McCallum: So, how do you feel? 
 D-████████: You didn't say you were going to experiment on me!

(There are sounds of a struggle for several seconds, during which glass can be heard breaking. There is a sound of papers rustling, after which the interview continues) 
 Dr. McCallum: I ask again: how do you feel?

D-████████: I feel fine. I do not have glass in my eyes.

Dr. McCallum: Excellent! Now, let's begin. 
 (D-████████ is fitted with SCP-619-J. After D-████████ removes their shirt, the interview continues.)

Dr. McCallum: Alright, this time with the belt on: how do you feel? 
 (D-████████'s voice has undergone a significant change. He speaks much more roughly, screaming at the top of his lungs.) 
 D-████████: I HAVE THE BLOOD OF THE WARRIORS PULSING THROUGH MY VEINS! THE ANCESPIRITS OF MY FOREWARRIORS FILLS ME WITH DESTRUCITY! (D-████████ makes a loud snorting noise) 
 Dr. McCallum: … Interesting. Tell me, what do you see? 
 D-████████: I SEE THE SCREAMS OF A THOUSAND NORMALS! NOW YOU MUST DEAL WITH ALL UNPLEASANTRIES! 
 Dr. McCallum: Wait… me? 
 D-████████: I WILL BREAK YOUR SPINE UNTIL YOUR CHILDREN ARE IN PAIN! 
 Dr. McCallum: That doesn't even make— (He is cut off by a scream from the subject) 
 (There are sounds of a struggle and several screams from Dr. McCallum. D-████████ is quickly subdued and separated from SCP-619-J.) 
 <End Log> 
 Closing Statement: After being separated from SCP-619-J, D-████████ claimed to have been under the delusion that he was standing in a wrestling ring surrounded by a cheering audience. Dr. McCallum has put through a request for D-████████ to be terminated. 
 Request denied. Don't be a jerk just because the guy put you in a half-nelson. O5-██ 
 It was a full-nelson followed by a submission hold. Honestly, I think termination is completely called for. Dr. McCallum 
 Addendum 619-J-03: 
 Incident: 
 SCP involved: SCP-619-J, SCP-076, SCP-███ 
 Personnel involved: D-7706 
 Date: ██████ 
 Location: █████████ 
 Description: During an attempted escape by SCP-███, D-7706 somehow came into possession of SCP-619-J. After attacking other D-Class personnel, Able, who had been helping during the crisis, stepped in. After a kick to the head, D-7706 was easily beaten. However, after his victory, Able was seen to remove the belt from D-7706's body and place it around his waist. Able then went on a rampage, killing numerous officers, before the device around his neck was detonated. 
 When questioned later, Able claimed that he had felt a compulsion to wear SCP-619-J after defeating D-7706. SCP-619-J is currently being tested for memetic properties. 
 I saw Able with the belt on. He was even more unbeatable, if that's possible. And, no, I could not 'smell what he was cooking'. Whatever that means. Agent █████████ 
 Addendum 619-J-04: After Dr. McCallum was seen running around the facility in a chicken suit, it was discovered he had stolen SCP-619-J for his own purposes. He was quickly subdued. The doctor had this to say about his actions: 
 Punish me all you want; I finally suplexed that cafeteria worker who never gives me flan. 
 Dr. McCallum was quickly informed that the cafeteria does not carry flan. 
 Addendum 619-J-05: Several agents have made an attempt to steal SCP-619-J and force D-Class personnel to wear it before throwing them into SCP-682's holding area. They were harshly disciplined and [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-630-J,"""A Song In Their Heart""","""Item #: SCP-630 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: When not in use, SCP-630 is to be kept folded in a locked steel locker at Site-69. It is to be inspected for damage and cleaned weekly. Once per month, SCP-630 is to be mounted in Site-69's auditorium and between 5 and 15 D-class exposed to it for 3 hours, or until all anomalous effects have ceased, with full video recording for later analysis. Under no circumstances are individuals with Security Clearance greater than Level 1 allowed to be on-site during a scheduled activation of SCP-630. 
 While active, the testing area should be completely isolated for a minimum of three hours. Camera feeds and remote recordings must be on a minimum of a five-minute delay. Adequate supplies of bottled water should be provided for affected individuals, in order to avoid dehydration or exhaustion. All testing of SCP-630 is to be recorded through both video and audio feed. All experiments are to be conducted in conjunction with members of MTF Theta-R (Tommy Tuneups). 
 Description: SCP-630 is a set of theater stage curtains made out of red velvet. SCP-630 appears to be physically indestructible, but can get dirty and requires regular maintenance to remove smoke residue, bloodstains, and water damage due to its effects. 
 When mounted upon any structure that could be construed as a stage (regardless of whether or not it is usually used for theatrical productions), SCP-630 enters an active state and will initiate a localized reality alteration should any sapient being come within ~10 meters of it. This state will persist for 150-300 minutes from the time of initiation, regardless of how many sapient beings are within range at time of cessation. Once the effect has ceased, SCP-630 will not activate for another 24 hours.1 If SCP-630 has not been used in 45 days, it will spontaneously activate regardless of its location, with an effective minimum range of 1 kilometer. 
 Any sapient being affected by SCP-630 will behave as if it is part of a musical theatrical performance and will spontaneously perform complex song-and-dance routines. While affected, affected individuals do not recognize this abnormal behavior as unusual, and will ignore or actively resist information to the contrary. The effect is contagious, and any individual who observes affected individuals live, whether in person or via audio or camera feed, will be similarly affected regardless of distance from SCP-630. However, recordings do not spread the effects, and an extensive collection of performances has been collected.2 
 While a performance is occurring, the surrounding environment will alter so as to present a more theatrically appropriate background, becoming prettier, more dramatic, or more representative of the theme of the piece being performed. This alteration includes increased luminosity in the area immediately surrounding the primary performers, topologically and structurally improbable alterations to the shape and construction of nearby structures, sudden weather changes, drastic alterations in the time of day or phase of the moon, and spontaneous sourceless musical accompaniment. Objects become optimized for use in musical performances, with clothing becoming more ""thematic""3 and offering a greater freedom of movement; footwear transforming into ballet shoes, tap shoes, or soft dance shoes; alarms becoming melodic and incorporating into any music playing; and any rhythmic sounds such as footsteps or clock tickings syncing up. Local fauna are occasionally involved, and there is one known instance of a complex 12-minute dance routine performed entirely by a collection of 50 housecats. 
 Although SCP-630 has no direct adverse effects on individuals while they are performing, personnel will frequently later complain of exhaustion, blistered and bruised feet, painful muscle cramps, and dehydration. Physically unfit individuals frequently collapse or faint once the reality alteration has ceased and subjects who have not received vocal training often suffer from respiratory ailments and strained vocal cords. While under the influence of SCP-630, individuals are unaware of these problems, but if enough area is available, will still drink water and take periodic rests ""backstage"" while others perform. 
 Affected performers have no regard for the appropriateness of the content of the songs they sing, and will freely express their innermost thoughts, expose embarrassing personal secrets, reveal classified information, and complain about mundanities such as mustard stains on their clothing.4

SCP-666-J,"""Dr. Gerald's Driving Skills""","""How the hell did he manage that with an electrically-powered segway? 
 Item #: SCP-666-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: D-Class and Gerald are the only ones allowed to get on any vehicle that Dr. Gerald happens to be driving. Prepare a number of body bags equivalent to the number of passengers on any vehicle that he happens to drive, minus himself. Additionally, medical teams must be on standby if Dr. Gerald will be traveling through a populated area, or any form of potentially hazardous environment (e.g., a nuclear power plant, chemical refining plant, etc). 
 Description: All individuals who board any vehicle or form of transportation that Dr. Gerald himself is controlling in any form are assured to die. Testing has shown that even those who escape vehicles he's been driving are doomed; they are generally struck by another moving vehicle within minutes. In such cases where the passengers aren't near any other vehicles, they will fatally suffer from apparent anxiety-induced heart attacks. Dr. Gerald himself, oddly enough, always survives whatever horrors he puts a vehicle through. 
 Additionally, all potentially hazardous objects seem to become even more dangerous if he is manning a vehicle in their general vicinity. Knives penetrate more than their sharpness would accord, normally benign oil tankers become moving bombs that will detonate with the slightest touch, buildings lose any significant rigidity, and pedestrians seem to lose all forms of self-preservation, throwing themselves into his path. A mere bicycle ride can inflict the devastation of an EF3 tornado. 
 Addendum 666-1: Dr. Gerald is never to come within 25 meters of SCP-462.

SCP-666½-J,"""The Roaring Flames of Hell""","""SCP-666½-J - The Roaring Flames of Hell by PeppersGhost 
 More by this author 
 Item #: SCP-666½-J 
 Object Class: Sweet mother of mercy is it ever Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: A minimum of seven (7) on-site staff members of Abrahamic faith must be present in SCP-666½-J's containment chamber at all times. SCP-666½-J must not come into contact with any living organism without the written permission of a Level-4 staff member. Weaponization and use of SCP-666½-J in containment/neutralization of Keter-Class SCP items is under review by the O5 Council. 
 Description: SCP-666½-J is a crab-stuffed mushroom entrée produced by the internal Foundation catering service Containment Cuisine for the 45th annual Site-19 Foundation Formal. Roughly 42% of the 1,500 attendees consumed SCP-666½-J and were subsequently affected by its anomalous properties. SCP-666½-J's effects started to become apparent approximately one hour after the conclusion of the main course, at which time event goers began to complain of slight abdominal pain. By the second hour, many attendees were complaining of significant digestive distress and all restrooms in the immediate vicinity were filled to capacity with extended queues. By the third hour, medical, investigative, and plumbing personnel were being flown in from surrounding sites to aid in relief efforts. 
 Those who have consumed SCP-666½-J say that it has an odd, salty tinge to it, likely caused by an experimental salt substitute used in its creation. It has been theorized that this substance is the root cause of SCP-666½-J's anomalous properties, although food poisoning as a result of poor hygiene amongst culinary personnel has also been considered. All staff members affiliated with Containment Cuisine have been put into custody for interrogation purposes as well as the individuals' own wellbeing. 
 When consumed by a human subject, SCP-666½-J triggers five stages of localized K-Class scenarios within the subject's digestive system. 
 In its initial stage, SCP-666½-J causes a brief period of mild nausea followed by a sudden and urgent need to relieve oneself. However, the instant before the crucial moment of blessed release, SCP-666½-J triggers a DK-Class Dominance shift, seizing control over the subject's nether regions and causing a massive shutdown of all the subject's bodily exits. The deep, carnal desire for release increases to the point that it becomes downright crippling. Subjects often experience shortness of breath, extreme jaw pain from the clenching of teeth, and mild bruising on hands from putting the rim of the toilet bowl in a death grip. 
 After 15-20 minutes of the subject's intestines experiencing a level of containment rivaling that of SCP-106 (and involving substantially more screaming), the subject will experience a brief RK-Class Rapture Scenario, feeling a relaxation of the lower muscles, a wave of elation, and a fleeting hope that the worst has passed. 
 Following this, the gates of Hell open up within the subject's intestines as Satan himself violates the subject's anal canal with a pickaxe. A sudden SK-Class Scorched Earth Scenario completely razes the interior lining of the afflicted's digestive tract as unholy murderflame rages throughout in a demonic vortex at a temperature of roughly HOLY-CRAP-ON-A-CUPCAKE degrees Kelvin. Every happy memory, every recollection of peace, joy, or anything other than sheer teeth-shattering agony is volcanically obliterated in a gastrointestinal supernova of biblical proportions. Subjects may experience blackouts or periods of lost time during this phase, their state of being reduced to a tear-blurred haze of torrential sweat, agonized wails, and desperate gasps for air. 
 This continues for the next two to three hours. It is common for subjects to briefly hallucinate during this stage, creating comforting mental scenarios in which they are violently murdered by various Keter-Class SCP entities. 
 Any last vestiges of hope are crushed into tiny nubbins as subjects undergo a CK-Class Total Containment Failure, finally expelling the contents of their bowels in a magnificent riptide that could best be compared to a single, large leak in the Hoover Dam: an unfathomably vast expanse of liquid ejected at a rate fast enough to be upsetting, but not fast enough to be merciful. Subjects have described the experience as the digestive equivalent of one's life flashing before their eyes, with every meal eaten during an individual's lifetime excruciatingly funneled out in reverse chronological order. 
 The downright baffling amounts of waste produced by the afflicted has led researchers to conclude that subjects' intestinal tracts are imbued with extradimensional or ectoentropic properties during this time. Ejected waste does not resemble good, wholesome fecal matter in the slightest. Rather, it is a roastawful terrorslush that is probably corrosive and almost definitely radioactive. The expulsion stage is usually fairly brief, but an anomalous temporal field created by SCP-666½-J causes subjects to perceive the experience as lasting roughly six lifetimes. 
 As the subject's ability to endure the emotional and physical trauma of the end-of-days inferno raging within their tenderest parts inevitably fails, SCP-666½-J will enter its final stage: a UK-Class Universal Collapse scenario, in which the subject experiences one final crescendo of gastric ragnarok followed by a blessed, merciful state of unconsciousness. Subjects will awaken one to two hours later with full memory of their experience; however, a number of afflicted individuals have reported finding themselves moved from one location to another during the period of time between passing out and regaining consciousness. One researcher testified to having found himself in a nearby field, clean and fully dressed, and laying atop a pile of 1986 Time magazines with no memory of how he arrived there. 
 Subjects who undergo SCP-666½-J's effects often bear psychological trauma from event as well as residual intestinal discomfort for the following fortnight. 
 Investigations are ongoing. Group of Interest involvement is being considered.

 Incident Log: On 04/26/2007, a small quantity of SCP-666½-J was fed to an as-of-then harmless Euclid-Class SCP object by researchers. The object has since shown extreme hostility toward anything resembling human life. Additionally, a mysterious substance of unknown origin manifesting on the floor of the SCP's containment chamber has created the need for routine cleaning. Cross exposure of SCP-666½-J in any situation other than attempted neutralization has since been prohibited. 
 Addendum: Despite objections by the Ethics Committee, a meal of SCP-666½-J was fed to SCP-682. At the apex of SCP-666½-J's wrath, SCP-682 threw its hands in the air, screamed ""Yog Sothoth take me now!"" and willingly left this mortal coil. Neutralization deemed successful.

SCP-721-J,"""A Stupid Dog Picture""","""Item #: SCP-721-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-721-J-1 has been safely contained at Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' house with an electric shock collar. SCP-721-J-1 is to be kept at Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' house at all times. Never let him leave, and if he does leave never ever let him near another Foundation site. 
 Description: SCP-721-J is an image of Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' dog, [REDACTED]1, hereafter SCP-721-J-1. SCP-721-J is a visual memetic agent that only affects individuals who have seen SCP-721-J-1 in person. The effect causes an individual to customize their personal belongings with SCP-721-J. This includes wall paintings, desktop backgrounds, calendars, mugs, t-shirts, etc. There are currently 9 instances of SCP-721-J in Doctor Lloyd Jenkins' office (not including each separate calendar month). There is no known cure for exposure. 
 Addendum: On 4/5/2017 a massive containment breach of SCP-721-J occurred on Site 127's annual bring your pet to work day. An estimated 56% of site personnel were exposed to SCP-721-J-1. Within a week of the initial breach the following customized orders were placed by site staff:

14 t-shirts
46 rolls of toilet paper
12 paintings
32 wallet pictures
3 tattoos
1 tombstone (pre-ordered) 
 Two days following the initial containment breach Site 127 staff began sending image spam of SCP-721-J to The Ethics Committee, Overwatch Command, and various other Foundation sites. Below is a transcript of emails regarding the misbehavior of Site 127 staff.

SCP-723-J,"""Sad Roach""","""Item #: SCP-723-J 
 Object Class :< 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-723-J is to be contained in the second-floor experimental lab utility closet. As SCP-723-J is allowed to roam this area freely, personnel entering the area are to remain vigilant. Retrieving SCP-723-J from within premises (""tactical wrangling"") is a low-priority exercise, to be given only to unoccupied wranglers. 
 Description: SCP-723-J is a Periplaneta americana (American cockroach) believed to be of advanced age, possessing characteristic downwards-slanted antennae. 
 SCP-723-J's anomaly manifests in the deep, unstated emotional turmoil that researchers have observed in its behavior. Individuals who monitor SCP-723-J are able to intuit its past experiences, with little explanation of how they received this information. Though a low percentage of personnel members are immune to this effect, various responses have been generated regarding perceptions of SCP-723-J and its accompanying ability (see following partial list of qualitative observational log SCP-723-J-13: personnel responses): 
 Dr. █████: He must be in a rough spot if he’s hanging out in the lab areas. It’s too cold for his species in there. I hope he finds his way outside where he belongs. 
 Dr. ██████: I felt bad for him since he seemed so lonely. I’ve actually never seen another bug in here, so I guess he must have lost his family. Maybe his mate too, if he had one. Poor guy. 
 Jr. Researcher ███: I think that maybe the roach's sister had roach syphilis and the roach tried to save her but he couldn't crawl fast enough and now the roach lives forever because that way the roach sister lives on. As a feeling in his roach heart. 
 Researcher █████: Maybe when he was a roach larva Roy Orbison was his hero because whenever his mom and dad fought he would run to his corner and watch Roy Orbison on the TV so he wouldn't hear them yelling. And one day his parents fought so loud that Sad Roach ran away and bought a bus ticket to Nashville to learn guitar like Roy Orbison. But when he got there the music teacher took one look at him and said that he could never play guitar because he had six legs and no hands or fingers. And he went to live in a diner and waits for the radio to play one more Roy Orbison song and thinks about what a fool he's been because he can't play guitar because he is a roach. 
 Technician ███████: I saw it on my keyboard yesterday and thought ""it must be tough to be that ugly."" 
 Upon initial contact, SCP-723-J was found on a railing in Site-19 staff parking structure 39-K. Site maintenance was informed, but SCP-723-J disappeared during the time taken for dispatched personnel to arrive. SCP-723-J was later sighted in the second-floor laboratory rooms, and most frequently in the lab's utility closet. Staff has agreed per consensus to allow SCP-723-J to live out his dreams to be a janitor with the cleaning supplies, as it is a much better alternative to the roach motel he previously worked at and he needs some time away from his delinquent younger brother. 
 It is currently unknown how SCP-723-J manages to sustain itself, as all edibles in close proximity to its containment are held in secure storage. Nevertheless, SCP-723-J sightings remain a relatively common occurrence, though SCP-723-J has been observed to flee immediately upon confrontation. 
 Addendum: Due to an accident caused by misunderstanding, SCP-723-J was involved in Incident 723-1. See excerpted log of incident: 
 Dr. ██████: [extraneous dialogue removed] So how did the briefing go? 
 Agent ████: Decently. I— hang on, there's something under the cabinets. 
 Dr. ██████: What? Which cabinet? 
 Agent ████: The one with the snacks. Looks like a roach. I'll get it.

 Agent ████: …the cockroach that you and Dr. █████ were talking about last month, that neither of you could squish no matter how hard you tried? I just thought it was fast as hell and you couldn’t catch it. They're health hazards, you know.

 As of ██/██/████, SCP-723-J is confirmed neutralized. Due to a perceived record of intense hardship, SCP-723-J was posthumously awarded the Dr. Blattodea Lifetime Achievement Award and the E-112 Marine Incineration Protocol. As Foundation interns were unable to fully retrieve SCP-723-J or its remains from the wastebin, the boot used during SCP-723-J's improvised non-emergency termination was burned following a brief, informal closed-shoebox ceremony. ██ personnel were in attendance.""","""He’s so sad. :(""",+237,active,_cc arthropod co-authored esoteric-class insect joke mark-kiryu neutralized riven-mercer scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-723-j

 Object Class: >:3 
 Fucks Given: n/a 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-724-J is to be kept in a standard containment locker. Staff are advised not to interact with, feed, or otherwise encourage the continued existence of SCP-724-J. 
 In addition, SCP-724-J is to be continuously loaded like a freight train, flyin' like an aeroplane, feelin' like a space brain one more time toniiyiiiight I'M ON THE NIGHTRAAAAAIN bottoms up I'M ON THE NIGHTRAIN fill mah cup I'M ON THE NIGHTRAIN ready to crash and buuuuurn I NEVER LEEEARN SCP-724-J is no longer permitted within 5m of a computer keyboard. 
 Description: SCP-724-J is a Periplaneta americana (American cockroach) believed to be the younger brother of SCP-723-J. 
 SCP-724-J's anomaly manifests in its complete disregard for morality, the feelings of others, the rules, and proper hygiene. It has developed asthma from its tobacco addiction, has failed to file tax returns for seven years in a row, has been implicated in a string of shoplifting incidents in Texarkana, and has been known to drive its 1997 Harley-Davidson FLHR Road King while drunk from Costco store-brand whiskey. 
 Dr. █████: I'm not gonna mince words here - he needs to get his act together. We're all very worried about him. His brother must be rolling over in his grave. 
 Dr. ██████: You know what, I think he's the reason why his brother was so sad. Maybe if he gave Sad Roach a better chance to connect with his only living family member, both of their lives would have been improved. But 724-J won't open up to anyone because he thinks he'll be emasculated, and it just makes me angry. 723-J deserved better family members than this. 
 Upon initial contact, SCP-724-J was seen leaving a ""roach motel"" pest trap at Site-19, along with SCP-72█-J.1 After a five-hour firefight with security staff with a total of 13 Foundation casualties2, primary containment was established upon apprehension.

SCP-727-J,"""Malevolent Celestial Object""","""Item #: SCP-727-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-727-J's size and presence it is becoming increasingly difficult to contain. Currently a 1,500,000 km x 1,500,000 km x 1,500,000 km carbon steel containment cube is being constructed; however, current estimates predict construction with current Foundation resources will take 150 million years. Until such time as SCP-727-J is contained personnel are recommended to not look upwards during daytime hours, in case of any psychic attack from SCP-727-J. 
 Description: SCP-727-J is a large, celestial object positioned approximately 149,600,000 km from the Earth, and is 1,391,000 km in diameter. SCP-727-J was originally considered to be of considerably smaller volume; however, examination by Foundation Personnel led to the discovery of its large size and classification as an SCP object. 
 SCP-727-J breaks several known physical laws. It does not fall into the Earth, but instead remains suspended above it. As well, it appears to be able to generate flame in the absence of oxygen. Study into how this is accomplished has been unsuccessful. 
 SCP-727-J appears to have some form of psychic influence on the Earth, causing the Earth to rotate in a circular path around SCP-727-J. SCP-727-J also has a memetic effect of causing itself to appear to rotate around the Earth. This is suspected as a mechanism to make itself appear more harmless. 
 SCP-727-J is capable of reaching extremely high temperatures. During testing several Class-D personnel were ejected into SCP-727-J, and all were found to be incinerated. Continual exposure to the rays emitted by SCP-727-J causes radiation burns. Malevolence of SCP-727-J is suspected. 
 Addendum 727-J-A: During routine examination of Foundation airspace, Foundation personnel discovered several thousand possible instances of SCP-727-J. Construction of containment chambers for each instance is currently underway. 
 Addendum 727-J-B: Due to the increasing threat imposed by SCP-727-J, SCP-1543-J-02 was commissioned and built for the purpose of attempting to destroy SCP-727-J with different objects. 
 Addendum 727-J-C: SCP-1960-J has been observed to temporarily disable SCP-727 periodically. Research into harnessing this technology is currently underway. 
 Experiment Log 727-J: 
 Object Used: Standard Class-B Fire Extinguisher 
 Observations: The fire extinguisher failed to activate and spray SCP-727-J. Recommendation to use a handler of the fire extinguisher next time. 
 Object Used: Standard Class-B Fire Extinguisher, D-Class Handler 
 Observations: D-5673 failed to activate the fire extinguisher before being incinerated by SCP-727-J. Recommendation for handler to be wearing an air tight suit. 
 Object Used: Standard Class-B Fire Extinguisher, D-Class Handler in air-tight suit 
 Observations: Amount of foam generated by the fire extinguisher insufficient to extinguish SCP-727-J. Recommendation to build Jupiter-sized fire extinguisher. 
 ((NOTE: Jupiter-sized fire extinguisher currently under consideration.)) 
 Object Used: 150,000,000 km long fire hose connected to the Pacific ocean 
 Observations: Failed to make any noticeable change. Project abandoned after 5 days. 
 Object Used: 1,435 D-Class Personnel instructed to ""Stop, Drop, and Roll""

SCP-729-J,"""Peep Peep, Motherfucker""","""Item #: SCP-729-J 
 Object Class: Keter Thaumiel (Guys, you're hurting his feelings! He's just trying to help!) (Can we maybe make a new object class for this thing? Maybe Apollyon+?) 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-729-J currently resides in Dr. Niles Hessen's office on her desk. Where, pray to god, it will stay. Request testing at your own risk. It breaches containment at an alarming frequency, but even MTF Nu-7 (""Hammer Down"") refuses to go near the fucking thing, so it does whatever the hell it wants. We are all at its mercy. Dr. Hessen has been commanded to turn in SCP-729-J for it to be properly contained…as soon as someone can get up the courage to write her an email. 
 Description: SCP-729-J is SUPPOSED to be a toy, but I want to know who the sick fuck was that wanted to give this thing to children. The label SAYS it's made of polyester fiber, but we all know it's made of the devil's couch stuffing. Or something. 
 Its reign of terror began during a containment breach of SCP-106. SCP-106 had managed to trap Dr. Hessen in her office and had successfully corroded a hole in the door when it caught sight of that goddamn thing SCP-729-J. SCP-106 stopped moving completely and began staring at SCP-729-J, showing no interest in Dr. Hessen. SCP-106 then began moving backwards out of Dr. Hessen's office, never breaking visual contact with that eldritch horror SCP-729-J, until it reached the end of the hall and promptly rematerialized back in its containment cell. It should be noted that SCP-106's middle fingers were raised for the entirety of the encounter with SCP-729-J. SCP-106's reaction is, frankly, perfectly understandable, and several researchers who witnessed the event were found huddling with SCP-106 in its containment cell. 
 TESTING LOGS: 
 SCP-2006 
 Effects: SCP-2006 screeched upon being introduced, and assumed a form identical to SCP-729-J. SCP-2006 has not changed form since the encounter. 
 SCP-1322 
 Effects: SCP-729-J was sent through the wormhole to the SCP-1322 society. It was returned 6 minutes later, tied to a white flag. 
 SCP-303 
 Effects: When Dr. Hessen was told to walk through a door with 303 on the other side while holding SCP-729-J, SCP-303 promptly opened the door for Dr. Hessen and ushered her through before quickly exiting the room, with Dr. Hessen showing no sign of the usual fear response. SCP-303 was found six hours later in an abandoned storage closet in a fetal position, sucking its thumb. 
 SCP-3000 
 Effects: SCP-729-J was put on a fishing hook and lowered into the sea, to where the current position of SCP-3000 was found with radar. After 2 hours of lowering it into the sea, Dr. Saarland complained about a cramp in his hand from unwinding the fishing pole and Dr. Bayer took over. Another 50 minutes later the assumed depth of SCP-3000 was reached. After 2 minutes, a tug was felt on the fishing pole and SCP-3000's presence swiftly disappeared from the radar. As Dr. Bayer also complained of his hand hurting, retrieval of the end of the fishing line was postponed. 
 I told them both they should do stretches beforehand, but no, ""We play Halo every Friday!"", ""Our wrists are trained!"". Should have listened. - Dr. Baden 
 The next day, after proper warmup, SCP-729-J was successfully retrieved, along with a crudely written note attached to it, reading: Alright, I thought we had a deal. I turn some consciousnesses to spaghetti, and you guys get your regrety-forgety. But, okay, you won. You get the forgety stuff for free. Lifetime supply. But please, just this one condition! Keep. That thing. Out. Of. My. Ocean! I'll go for a while. I need to calm down. 
 SCP-055
Effects: Dr. Hessen walked into the containment chamber of SCP-055 holding SCP-729-J. About 5 minutes later, the containment chamber opened and a calico cat ran into Dr. Hessen's office.
Oh, Pudding, come here! I brought a new friend for you! -Dr. Hessen
Wait, we even had a 055? And it's a cat named Pudding? -Dr. Aksum 
 SCP-650
Effects: Dr. Hessen was told to directly observe SCP-650 in its containment cell whilst holding SCP-729-J. Before Dr. Hessen could be asked to break her line of sight with SCP-650, the lighting within SCP-650's containment cell briefly deactivated and the sound of quick, heavy footsteps could be heard from its room, according to Dr. Hessen. When the power to SCP-650's chamber was restored, SCP-650 had completely vanished from its containment site and was nowhere to be found near Dr. Hessen; however, onsite staff noted that a sign of the cross had been crudely carved into one of the walls within SCP-650's containment cell. A containment breach alert was sounded; after two hours of extensive searching, SCP-650 was discovered hiding within a storage closet, apparently having attempted to bury its head into the floor. SCP-650 was eventually returned to its containment cell, but has since constantly faced the wall with the engraved cross and has not moved from its position. 
 SCP-1048 
 Effects: When exposed to SCP-729-J, all copies made by SCP-1048 became immobile and have not regained mobility since exposure. SCP-1048 appeared alarmed by this, making a gesture like the sign of the cross, and retreated behind its copies. SCP-1048 regained the ability to make copies of itself when SCP-729-J was removed. It now frequently produces art that depict SCP-729-J as monstrous in some form, and cowers if shown a picture of SCP-729-J. 
 Not even the teddy? Aww… Poor Mr. Buns. He just wants some friends! - Dr. Hessen 
 Try 2317. Maybe then that hellbeast can be with its own kind. -Dr. Yvaine 
 It wouldn't play with him either! - Dr. Hessen 
 … My god. - Dr. Yvaine 
 SCP-682
Effects: [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Long story short, we reclassed SCP-682 as Neutralized. You don't even want to fucking know how this little fucker killed it. - Dr. Foxfield 
 SCP-076
Effects: SCP-729-J was placed inside SCP-076’s containment area when scans showed that SCP-076-2’s heart was beginning to beat. All humans exited the room, and researchers watched behind a camera. When SCP-076-2 got out of SCP-076-1, instead of looking for the nearest human, he looked straight at 729-J. SCP-076-2 materialized an American M9-Flamethrower and the corresponding fuel pack. He attempted to use it on SCP-729-J, but the flamethrower did nothing to it. When SCP-076-2 ran out of fuel and saw that 729-J was unharmed, he ran back into SCP-076-1 and curled up into a ball. Crying sounds were coming from the inside of SCP-076-1. It has been 2 weeks, and SCP-076-2 has yet to come out of that position. 
 SCP-073
Effects: When exposed to SCP-729-J, SCP-073 took a cup of water, and proceeded to bless it. SCP-073 then vocalized the phrase: “FUCK OFF, DICKNIPS!” and soaked the little shit in the holy water. 
 SCP-073 remained under a table for the remainder of the test, with its fingers in the form of a cross. 
 SCP-187
Effects: Upon being exposed to SCP-729-J, SCP-187 began to vomit and froth at the mouth. SCP-187 displays rapid emotional changes, switching from screaming and babbling to squealing and cooing. SCP-187 is immediately removed. 
 Upon being interviewed, SCP-187 said ""How can such a thing be so ungodly yet so cute?!"" SCP-187 is currently undergoing therapy. 
 SCP-1915
Effects: SCP-729-J is exposed to SCP-1915. Upon exposure, SCP-1915 exclaimed while raising his arms high into the air ""I QUIT!"" 
 SCP-1915 breaches containment and [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 SCP-1915 is currently believed to be conversing with SCP-3812 about the futility of Narratives and plot points, currently debating which of their creators have the smallest dick. 
 SCP-4812-K
Effects: SCP-729-J is launched straight at SCP-4812-K. 
 SCP-4812-K begins to scream and writhe around, before charging towards SCP-225-1, killing itself. 
 SCP-4812-S and -E are reported at this time to breach containment, both self terminating. SCP-729-J is retrieved and given back hastily by the GOC, stating it killed the Eros entity by landing on it. 
 Note: Upon being asked how he is still capable of talking and reacting in a calm and stoic manner around that goddamn thing, Dr. Gears spoke calmly, stating ""I have actually soiled my pants the first time I looked at it, and Now I have a super toilet in the observation deck, with a throw up bucket and shower included. I honestly am as disgusted by it as you are."" 
 SCP-173
Effects: [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Don't ask about it. No, the war head did not destroy either of them. No, there was no grand battle. Yes, there was a discussion. No, do not go and try searching for the Koitern or the [DATA LOST].

Yes, that is all we found in the second SCP-5000 suit that showed up in SCP-173s containment chamber. -Green 
 “I don’t know. I think he looks cute with it!” -Dr.Hessen 
 SCP-001
Effects: Tom Brady, Quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was abducted and forced to throw SCP-729-J into SCP-001’s radius. SCP-001 immediately looked at 729-J and bowed. A mouth shaped opening appeared on SCP-001’s head, and in a loud voice, it said “My lord.” SCP-001 then picked up 729-J and put it in the garden on the other side of the gate that SCP-001 guarded. 729-J was only able to be retrieved when SCP-001 was allowed to have SCP-999 for a day. 
 Don’t worry, Tom Brady was given, as SCP-3000 so gracefully put it, ‘regrety-forgety’. - Dr. [REDACTED], head of the Amnestics department 
 SCP-049
Effects: When exposed to SCP-729-J, SCP-049 appeared to stagger, grasping its head with its hand and falling to its knees, stating ""The Pestilence… it's… too strong…"" SCP-049 then attempted to crawl towards SCP-729-J, vocalizing ""I must… cure you…"" but fell to the ground and fell unconscious. 
 ""Damn, guess that dude's too strong a plague even for 049"" -Dr. Brine 
 SCP-294
Effects: D-382563 was asked to type ‘SCP729J’ on SCP-294’s keyboard. He initially refused, stating that he had heard stories of 729-J from the other Class-D’s, and that he “wanted nothing to do with that creature of Satan”. D-382563 was held at gunpoint by a security officer until he obliged to type it. 294 produced a titanium cup, with the words ‘This is the only thing that can hold a liquid of this toxicity’ imprinted on the outside of it. The cup was then filled with a neon yellow liquid. D-382563 was, again, held at gunpoint, until he drank the liquid. After D-382563 drank it, his eyes turned red, and then promptly [DATA EXPUNGED]. His whole body then turned inside out. Flaming skeleton hands emerged from the ground and dragged him down into the floor. When D-382563 was gone, a note appeared where he was dragged into the ground. The note read ‘That little shitstain of a toy did not come from here, and I beg you to keep it FAR away from here. -Satan’. 
 “G-G-Get me the FUCK out of here!” -Dr. Roshland, an hour before resigning. 
 SCP-914
Effects: SCP-729-J was placed in the intake booth of SCP-914 by Dr. Hessen. SCP-914 was set to ""Rough"" by Dr. ███████ in order to, ""Finally terminate this god forsaken abomination"". When attempting to turn the key, SCP-914 refused to operate while SCP-729-J was in the intake. Investigation of SCP-914 shows that a note was found in the output booth. The note read, ""This is one thing that can not be refined. I don't care how many times you try, get that shit out of here."" 
 SCP-231
Effects: [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Procedure 110-Montauk has now been replaced with periodic exposure to SCP-729-J, given the much higher levels of emotional distress produced by the latter.

 Description: SCP-732-J is a decorative ceramic seahorse figurine, predominantly jade green in coloration and measuring approximately 3 cm in height2. 
 Though a significant percentage of individuals are immune to SCP-732-J’s effects, SCP-732-J possesses a variety of subtle anomalous characteristics, including: 
 SCP-732-J was purchased on ██/██/██, from the ███████ Aquarium gift shop in ████ █████, █████████ following a routine Foundation staff work retreat at the location. SCP-732-J was part of a production set of forty other figurines nearly identical3 in appearance. 
 Addendum SCP-732-J-1: Tiny Ceramic Seahorse is currently allocated to a timeshare at Dr. Mercer’s desk to maintain staff morale. Below is an excerpt of the interview immediately preceding confirmation of this containment change.

 Dr. Mercer: Yes. Him.

 Dr. Kiryu: Maybe. Are you going to try and talk me out of it again? I told you already, it's nice to have such a companionable paperweight that doesn't fall over if the desk shakes. Plus the seahorse was just four dollars and they don’t take up a lot of space compared to other decorations. And he's not a pain to clean if he gets dusty— 
 Dr. Mercer: …Actually, I was hoping to get one for myself. And maybe my cousins. Your Tiny Ceramic Seahorse looks happy.

 Description: SCP-777 or Darkblade (Blade for short), as he chooses to be called, is a white male of about 17 years old. He has flowing white hair with green highlights and crystal blue eyes that reflect a dark past. He is clad in ebony armor that he made himself. His effect on female personnel (which may not even be a supernatural effect) is very powerful. He is described as a “smooth pimp” and is totally irresistible. He has chosen Iris as his bride though to wed when his mission is over. His element is water, which he has full control of, and he has a pet dragon, who must be referred to as ""Set"". Blade's power of water, as well as his supernatural skill with a Katana, protects him from all harm.

 Dr. Edison: Here's the reports on SCP-682 that you asked for, Mr. Darkblade. 
 Darkblade: Thank you, Edison… or should I say; ""Space Detective Kamen Mask X""! 
 Dr. Edison: Heh. You're perceptive as ever, Darkblade. Here I was, thinking you forgot about your old rival. 
 *Puff of smoke. Edison appears a split second later wearing a spandex outfit with a visored helmet.* 
 Kamen Mask X: You'll pay for the horrible things you did to me all those years ago! 
 Darkblade: I've moved on, Edison. I've turned away from the darkness, to embrace the light. Someday you'll understand. Someday I'll even atone for the vague sins I committed upon you during my dark and troubled past that led to your decision to join the Galaxy Federation to spy on the Foundation in hopes that you could someday kill me. 
 Kamen Mask X: So… *Pulls out laser sword* Shall we dance? 
 Darkblade: Indeed.  *Pulls out katana* 
 Dr. Trebuchet: 777, is it? 
 Darkblade: Call me Darkblade. 
 Dr. Trebuchet: … ""Blarkdade""? 
 Darkblade uses a Phoenix Down on Dr. Trebuchet, who is immediately brought back to life. 
 Darkblade: Come with me, Epiphany, and we shall destroy the Mako generators that are draining life energy from the planet! 
 Dr. Trebuchet: Saving the world through eco-terrorism and corporate sabotage? Count me in! 
 Darkblade picks Epiphany up like a dufflebag by the strap on her lab coat, and jumps over the edge of a bridge onto a passing train below. They vanish off into the horizon. 
 Darkblade is sitting on a bed of roses, wearing black jeans and a black t-shirt he purchased from Hot Topic. Research Assistant Corbette bursts in with purple highlighted hair and white foundation on. 
 Research Assistant Corbette: So… you came back, Blade. 
 Darkblade: Yes, I came back. For you. 
 Research Assistant Corbette: (Leaning in) Never leave again, Blade. (Crying) 
 Darkblade: (Grabs Research Assistant Corbette's chin and looks him in the eye) I never will, Salman. (Embraces Research Assistant Corbette, [DATA EXPUNGED]) 
 Salamandra Black'ness Anastasia Falcon Corbette: Oh, Blade. 
 Dr. ██████████: (Filming) You guys are so hot. 
 Darkblade is shown in his room, meditating over the shark enclosure. Delivery Agent Roadrunner enters the room, looking somewhat perturbed. 
 Roadrunner: …I was called? 
 Darkblade: Indeed you were. I have need of your vehicle. 
 Roadrunner: Oh? What for? 
 Darkblade: I will be participating in a race. The prizes are artifacts that allow the user to ascend to godhood. My extremely stereotypical rival is entering, and I must see to it that his desire for power remains unfulfilled. 
 Roadrunner: You can have it… over my dead body. 
 Darkblade: *slowly stands, and enters a fighting stance* Then you leave me no choice. 
 Roadrunner: *tears his handgun out of its holster, and levels it at Darkblade* EAT 230 GRAIN JACKETED HOLLOWPOINTS, ASSHOLE! 
 Darkblade proceeded to deflect all ten .45 caliber rounds away from himself using his unreal reactions and his katana. The last deflected round struck Roadrunner in the head, killing him. The security feed cuts off here, and resumes half an hour later. Any traces of violence at the scene are gone, as well as the corpse. On the far wall, Roadrunner's CZ-97B is seen, mounted along with the many other trophies that Darkblade has taken from his fallen foes. Roadrunner's vehicle was immediately bequeathed to Darkblade.

SCP-800-J,"""American Football""","""Item #: SCP-800-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: As new variants of SCP-800-J are discovered, they are to be isolated and all players issued Class-F amnestics. Following this treatment, they are to be trained on how to properly play football. 
 Description: SCP-800-J designates a troubling number of Football sporting leagues in which all players, officials, spectators, and linesmen are unable to discern the proper methods of playing the game. In some respects, the game eventually played has almost no resemblance to football. 
 SCP-800-J was discovered on 09/18/2011, by Senior Researcher Collins, after erroneously flipping to the other channels included in his 'Big All-American Sporting Network' and finding that the package contained odd variants of football. After receiving inadequate explanation from his cable provider, Collins declared it to be an anomaly and called Site-77 personnel to enact containment procedures. Several instances of SCP-2008-J have been documented in SCP-800-J broadcasts. 
 Researcher's note: I have observed that almost none of these variants are played with regulation equipment, and scandalously, even fewer are played on Sunday. 
 Addendum: Variants observed: 
 Observation Date: 
 Observation Notes: 
 Observation Date: 09/18/2011 
 Observation Notes: First observed instance. Takes place in a rotund playing field, with players wearing shockingly little protection. Ball appears to be much smaller, and white, possibly composed of sheepskin or albino pigs. Touchdowns achieved by circling bases. Claims to be America's 'national pastime' have been conclusively proven to be possibly untrue. 
 Observation Date: 10/22/2011 
 Observation Notes: This variant appeared to be played on ice, and at no point did the players actually have possession of the ball. Ball itself had been burned into a hard circle, possibly made of charred bacon, which was theorized to be held together by the low temperatures. Yardage was gained and lost very quickly, with no regard to downs. Goal celebrations were dis-pleasurably noted to be very over the top. 
 Observation Date: 11/16/2011 
 Observation Notes: Played between two players, both wearing extensive padding, and wielding swords. Dueled until one player scored an apparent touchdown by tackling the other player with their sword. Noted to be ""pretty cool"" by Researcher Collins. 
 Observation Date: 03/23/2012 
 Observation Notes: No balls are present. Players appear to throw themselves over the field goal posts, with a broken portion of another field goal post. Possibly developed in a post-apocalyptic reality where all footballs have been destroyed, so players must use themselves. 
 Observation Date: 4/15/2012 
 Observation Notes: Game was played exclusively with feet. No resemblance to football whatsoever. Recommending demotion of all players to D-Class, due to the dubious nature of them ever being trained to play a real sport. 
 Observation Date: 10/3/2012 
 Observation Notes: Variant takes place between two players, who stand on opposite podiums in an enclosed stadium. Linesmen dictate questions to the players, who gain yardage by answering them in a forum-fashion. Touchdowns appear to be obtained abstractly through applause. 
 Observation date: 10/12/2012 
 Observation notes: The football is repeatedly passed back and forth between two quarterbacks, while the rest of the team apparently ditched them to go get smoothies or something. Ball appears to be a lime, with both quarterbacks so disgusted by it that they only touch it with some kind of slicing racket. Very limited football attire. 
 Observation date: 11/22/2012 
 Observation notes: This anomalous edition of football appears to be… played with one player. Who is a horse. All play appeared to consist of post-touchdown dancing. During play, it does not appear to matter how many yards the horse moves down, and during extensive review of play no downs have been detected. Touchdown ratios have reached a new low.

Ta get ta the fortune that awaits, ya must take 20 paces east past the forked tree, then 30 paces north from the swift stream. It's buried 'neath an X in the sand. But, only the most courageous of all men dare ta disturb old Captain Blue's last treasure. Some say ta this day, his ghost still haunts the island, waitin' fer unlikely men ta try and take his precious booty. Then he snatches them up they're nary seen again. 
 Sailin' ta the isles that hold the lost booty is an adventure itself. Its location can only be found on a map, contained within Davy Jones' Containment Locker 808-J on Ship-19. The island is surrounded by reefs and rocks that only the most experienced seaman can navigate, else he crash and end in the deep blue. Captains are not ta bring woman aboard their ship, even ne'er seen before beauties can bring only the worst of luck. Men that learn the location of the island without permission from O5-R are ta walk the plank. Dead men tell no tales. 
 In order ta survive the long haul, captains are ta bring many fruits aboard ta be savin' even their scurviest of dogs. 
 Description: SCP-808-J is a treasure long lost from the knowledge of yer everyday landlubber. Only legends tell of its existence, a vast fortune hidden away by the great Site Captain Blue many years ago. It's said that he who finds the treasure may be the richest man ta sail the seven seas.

SCP-810-J,"""A Dog In Need Of Funds""","""Item #: SCP-810-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-810-J is to be fed and walked twice daily by a female Foundation staff member. SCP-810-J is to be under constant surveillance. All banks within a 5 km radius of Site-27 are to be monitored in the case of a containment breach. 
 Description: SCP-810-J is a male German Shepherd capable of American-English speech. Any male-identifying person will perceive all statements made by SCP-810-J as true, and will not perceive SCP-810-J's behavior as unusual in any way. SCP-810-J will not engage in conversation on any subject other than whether or not the other participant is willing to lend SCP-810-J five thousand dollars. SCP-810-J will regurgitate a small porcelain figurine of a stylized toadstool, designated SCP-810-J-1 and offer it as collateral for the exchange if the approached individual appears uninterested. If the individual questions SCP-810-J's ability to repay the debt, SCP-810-J will claim that its father, Mick Jagger, will be perfectly willing to cosign. Though males may believe these statements due to SCP-810-J's anomalous properties, SCP-810-J does not seem to increase an affected individual's willingness to lend it money. Affected individuals will, however, attempt to convince others to help SCP-810-J, often being the primary subject of conversation for up to three hours after exposure.

 Interviewer: Dr. Patricia Whack 
 <Begin Log> 
 Dr. Whack: Hello, SCP-810-J. How are you today? 
 SCP-810-J: I'm just fine, except that there's a small matter I think you can help me with.

 SCP-810-J: Five thousand dollars. That's all I need from you. Look, my dad - Mick, you know Mick, right? Gimme Shelter? Paint it Black? Call him up right now, he'll tell you. I need the money, bad. Throw me a bone here. 
 Dr. Whack: SCP-810-J, we've contacted Mr. Jagger and he claims to have no relation to you. As was expected. 
 SCP-810-J: Old dad. Drugs really got to him. Look, here, I'll make you a deal. [SCP-810-J regurgitates SCP-810-J-1.]

 Closing Statement: The value of SCP-810-J-1 appears minimal, and it seems to serve no function other than a bargaining chip for SCP-810-J. More research is clearly required as to why SCP-810-J values it so highly, or what it believes its purpose to be.

 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: At present, SCP-885-J is located at Site 13, although Foundation personnel speculate that there may be additional instances at the residence of Researcher Jacobs. Investigations into how an actual human being could live like that are ongoing. 
 Attempts to end the phenomenon through direct communications with the source have repeatedly failed. Individual instances of SCP-885-J may be temporarily prevented by enactment of Protocol Lambda-8 (""Revoking Jacobs' Break Room Privileges Until He Stops Leaving His Dirty Dishes Everywhere"") or Delta-9 (""Leaving Jacobs' Dirty Dishes On His Desk Until He Gets The Message""). Should Event Zeta-4 (""Jacobs Cleaning Up After Himself Like A Human Fucking Being"") occur, SCP-885-J is to be considered neutralized. However, this eventuality is seen as being highly unlikely. 
 Description: SCP-885-J is a phenomenon that occurs following Researcher Darryl Jacobs' preparation of food in the Site 13 break room. Regardless of the food prepared, a large number of dishes1 will be left uncleaned in the break room sink. Unlike normal dishes produced by someone who has a concept of responsibility and who does not expect everyone else to clean up after them like they're eight years old, these dishes will go uncleaned for an indefinite period of time, usually between one to three days, before other Foundation personnel grow tired of looking at them and clean the dishes themselves.

A cell at Site-11's what this creature should be sleeping in.
The walls are sealed hermetically with seven-layered steel doors each,
And anyone who says its name, we'll fill their head and veins with bleach.
Description: of 900-J is delicate, to say the least.
To put it most politely, it's a putrid planet-eating beast!
Its surname's a cognitohazard, first initial W.

In short, a hostile monster that can class a day with X and K!
Let's lock it up and let it rot, this SCP-900-J.

And all of his subordinates in ways no one could understand

SCP-930-J,"""You little rascal!""","""Item #: SCP-930-J 
 Object Class: Euclid, if you don't let the cute little bugger out of your sight. 
 Special Containment Procedures: I'm in a bit of a hurry for my dinner date, but I can give you the run-down while I'm here! SCP-930-J really likes apple juice, so I have a few extra cartons in the fridge which should have enough by the time I get back. For dinner tonight, there's a box of microwavable french fries for dinner, which is around when some kids' specials should come on TV. That'll at least keep it occupied for a couple hours. Try to keep a watch on it whenever possible. If it disappears when you're not looking at it, just leave some apple juice out. Oh yeah, if you want to order some takeout or eat any meat, wait until it sleeps before going out to get something. And don't bring it back in the house. The kid likes to make a mess. 
 Bathing? I already gave the little tyke a bath before you arrived, but in case it somehow finds a way to get even dirtier, just start up the bath. It really likes very hot temperatures, so make sure to crank the temperature up all the way. There's also a box of rubber ducks nearby for it to chew on while it gets bathed. 
 If SCP-930-J falls asleep, it's best to just leave it sleeping wherever it is. If it sleeps close enough to its bedroom, you can probably risk rolling it over to the bedroom. Don't worry about the way the texture feels, it'll probably be the only time you need to touch it, but be sure to roll it back into bed as quickly as you can. Really, once it falls asleep, it's more or less out for the next 48 hours. You just need to wait until I get back after that. 
 If anything goes wrong and it starts acting crazed, text me and immediately sprint 50 meters out of the house. Any direction. You have my number if you need it. 
 Description: SCP-930-J is a cute little ball of assorted tentacles and mouths, isn't it? I named it Daniel! I tried measuring it a few times before, and I got approximately 230 cm in diameter, but it's sort of hard to do that with everything in the way. It also kept trying to bite my fingers, and I didn't want to give it a taste for blood again. I think it's mostly pacified by this point. 
 There's sort of weird, sticky texture that covers it. It's gelatinous, but it feels weirder than that. Do you know what rotten egg smells like? Imagine that except you feel it all over. Even though it feels weird, it'll pacify you and try to absorb you in it if you touch it long enough. Its tentacles infrequently ooze black sludge, but not too much. I wouldn't taste it if I were you. 
 It gets shy real easily, and wants to hide whenever it can. It'll come back quickly enough if you leave something out for it to eat or drink. The sense of smell it has is very impressive! 
 Discovery: Where did I find it? Well, I was driving to buy some groceries around a year ago, and I passed this farm. The farm's out of the town by quite a few miles, you might have seen it on your way here. When I passed there, I found a bunch of sheep just dead out in the front. Poor things. Absolutely torn to shreds. SCP-930-J was hopping around in a crater nearby, sounding really crazed. 
 I managed to subdue it before it could leave the farm and cause havoc elsewhere. I saw there were some sort of runes nearby, but I couldn't decipher them. Anyway, you can't just leave something like that there, you know? I wanted to take it back here and at least raise it until I could understand it better or whatever family it has comes to pick it up again. 
 Oh, no, don't worry, nothing will happen. It can be a bit of a troublemaker, but nothing you can't handle, I'm sure! You two have fun!""",,+44,active,alive euclid extraterrestrial joke sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-930-j

 Object Class: Safe (Keter reclassification pending) 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-938-J is currently housed at Site-48. The object is to be kept in a Level 1 containment locker. Access is granted to all personnel of Site-48. 
 Description: SCP-938-J is an indestructible standard digital alarm clock developed by the Timelink company. Though it possesses standard buttons for an alarm clock otherwise, there is no visible control to switch off the alarm. SCP-938-J functions like a normal alarm clock, even without batteries. 
 The only anomalous property that is known occurs when a subject is 10 meters from the object while in REM sleep. Usually, subjects that are having a dream1 will be disrupted by SCP-938-J at 6:10 AM by a digital chime that plays a version of ""Frère Jacques"" with several notes arbitrarily off-key. The volume is unpredictable but has been as high as 90 dB. 
 In 100% of all cases, subjects will be enraged by SCP-938-J and will attempt to destroy the object because of SCP-938-J's chime. 
 The only known method to turn off the alarm of SCP-938-J after it has been activated is to engage in Procedure 421-Tantalus. 
 PROCEDURE 421-Tantalus 
 1. Subject will hit the snooze button no more and no less than 15 times.
2. Subject will deposit three drops of blood onto the clock face.
3. Subject will recite the phrase, with correct diction, ""Schnütfleiger Dachlach F'trejnargoöstatchch Üuåh!""2 
 If Procedure 421-Tantalus fails, the alarm will gradually decrease in volume over 3 hours until it becomes silent. Subjects who have failed Procedure 421-Tantalus report having the alarm's iteration of ""Frère Jacques"" stuck in their head for the following week.

SCP-939-J: Take me off of this leash or I will discover the resonant frequency of your brain and play it with an instrument constructed from your entrails. 
 Agent Rosencrantz: Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? 
 SCP-939-J: Ok, fuck it. There's a crime happening over that wall and it needs your attention. 
 Agent Rosencrantz: Crap, I'll call security. 
 SCP-939-J: No, they'll be too slow. You need to blow a hole in the wall and get out there now. 
 Agent Rosencrantz: Sharp as always, 939-J! I know I can count on you! 
 Agent Rosencrantz fired multiple rounds into the concrete wall surrounding the Site-20 recreation yard before inserting a grenade, blowing a sizable hole in the wall. 
 SCP-939-J: Here, follow me. 
 Agent Rosencrantz: Across that road? There's no stop sign or anything there. 
 SCP-939-J: You work in a building with hundreds of MacGuffins and you're concerned about traffic? 
 Agent Rosencrantz: Road safety is no joke. 
 SCP-939-J: Unlike you.

SCP-990-J,"""Dream Dude""","""Item #: SCP-990-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Currently no containment measures for SCP-990-J have been devised, and, due to extensive budget cuts, we can no longer keep paying personnel to come up with ideas. All suggestions are welcome,1 however, do not expect any sort of raise or recognition for your efforts. 
 Also, this may not be the best place to put this but, while we're on the subject of money, we're going to have to limit everyone in Site-19 to two cups of coffee per day. SCP-294 refuses to comply with personnel requests for liquids of any kind,2 and you seriously do not realize how much we spend per quarter on Folgers alone. It's appalling.3 
 Description: SCP-990-J is the designation for a human male dressed in Tommy Bahama-brand clothing that appears to Foundation personnel through dreams.4 So far, no Foundation personnel have encountered SCP-990-J in the real world; if he corresponds to an actual human being, we have yet to find him, and because of the aforementioned budget cuts, we probably won't find him. 
 SCP-990-J has been appearing to Foundation personnel since 1993,56 but his existence as an anomalous entity did not come to light until 2004, when the Foundation Human Resources Department responded to the original tickets submitted a decade prior. The entity did not receive official classification until the events of Incident 990-1. 
 Incident Log 990-1: 
 Edward J. ██████, a Level I Junior Research Technician working in the Site-19 anomalous entity intake ward, reportedly failed to clock out for his unpaid lunch on 10/21/2005, leading to a formal audit the following day. 
 Camera footage of ██████ revealed he had fallen asleep during this period, yet did not possess any knowledge of having done so, insisting he had spent that time doing intake of an entity, proceeding to transcribe his conversation with SCP-990-J for use as evidence in the audit. Following the conclusion of said audit, this transcript should be available below for personnel to read. UPDATE 10/23/2005: As per majority vote of the O5 council, ██████ will be allowed to retain his wages for time spent asleep, on the grounds that he was under the influence of anomalous phenomena at the time.Way to go, Eddy! Fight the system! 
 Transcript 990-1 
 ██████: Okay, so, welcome to Site-19. My name is Edward, I'm a Junior Technician here, and my job right now is to get some basic information from you and answer any questions you might have about what you're going through as you transition into long-term living here at 19. 
 SCP-990-J: Oh, so like an interview? 
 ██████: Yeah, more or less. 
 SCP-990-J: Cool, cool, sounds good to me. 
 ██████: Alright, please state your name. 
 SCP-990-J: Uhhh, what about Bobby? 
 ██████: Bobby? Is that your name? 
 SCP-990-J: Yeah. No, wait, how about Phil? Is Phil taken? 
 ██████: Taken? That's not how names work- 
 SCP-990-J: You're right, Bobby is better, can I go back to Bobby? 
 ██████: Bobby it is, then. 
 SCP-990-J: You know what, you're gonna hate me but I don't think I'm feeling Bobby anymore. I said it over and over and now it doesn't sound like a real name. Bobby. Bob-by. Just pick something for me, I'm indecisive. 
 ██████: I literally can't progress to the next page until I put something in the field for ""name"". 
 ██████: I'm going to put ""Tommy Bahama"" because of your shirt. 
 SCP-990-J: [laughs for an objectively uncomfortable amount of time] 
 ██████: It really wasn't that funny. 
 SCP-990-J: Actually, while I have you here, can I talk to you about something? It's important. 
 ██████: Uh, sure? 
 SCP-990-J: Great, great. So listen, buddy. Last year I made eighteen hundred dollars a week working from the comfort of my own home. Isn't financial independence the best? 
 ██████: Y-Yeah, I mean, I guess so.7 
 SCP-990-J: Anyway, you seem like a smart guy, and I like that, so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You can also be making this kind of cash, man. You can have two cars and a mansion too baby. You just gotta invest in your future. Invest, in- Herbalife. 
 ██████: [laughs nervously]

SCP-990-J retrieves a case of supplements and a binder from under the table. 
 ██████: -oh, shit, you're serious. 
 SCP-990-J: I am so serious, Ethan. 
 ██████: It's Edwa- 
 SCP-990-J: I am so very serious about giving you the opportunities you've only dreamed of. Now, I'm a straight shooter, you're a straight shooter, let's get down to brass tacks, I want you to be my prime VIP downline distributor, can I sign you up for the welcome package or what? 
 ██████: Uhhh…. 
 SCP-990-J opens the binder in presentation to ██████. 
 SCP-990-J: See, for every distributor you sign up, you get a portion of their earnings and their signed-up distributors' earnings and so forth. There is literally no limit to the cash you can make! 
 ██████: This is a pyramid scheme. 
 SCP-990-J: A what now? 
 ██████: A pyramid scheme. You know, guy at the top gets the big cheese, the lesser guys make money based on the number of people you recruit under you. I don't even know what your product is. What does it do? 
 SCP-990-J: Herbalife is a, ahem, a proprietary blend of antioxidants, enzymes and essential vitamins specifically designed to rid the body of toxins and- 
 ██████: I can see you reading off the label. You don't know anything about the products you sell, do you? 
 SCP-990-J: It's organic. It's full of organics. 
 ██████: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

 Description: SCP-999-J is an overweight, Caucasian, balding male devoid of all clothing beyond that of a Speedo brand pair of swim briefs, henceforth to be referred to as SCP-999-J-1. SCP-999-J is capable of teleporting onto any bed, although it appears he prefers them to be occupied. He will lie there and breathe heavily with his mouth open until the subject awakens, at which point he'll look at the subject and then slowly reach his hand into SCP-999-J-1. SCP-999-J will then pull out some form of non-anomalous object, most commonly a can of Surge or a generic trading card. 
 SCP-999-J typically appears during periods of intense self-gratification, sleep, copulation between couples, and after urination. 
 Addendum 999-J-1: D-5638 was planted in a bedroom with a microphone attached. SCP-999-J appeared approximately 2 hours into D-5638's sleep cycle. The following audio was recorded: 
 Addendum 999-J-2: Incident 999-J-5: 
 On ██/██/████, SCP-999-J teleported into the bedroom of a couple in the midst of sexual intercourse. He asked them to continue and offered to watch. SCP-999-J proceeded to spend nine minutes searching through 999-J-1. He found a lone cheeto and consumed it. SCP-999-J reported the cheeto to be slightly ""chewy"" in texture, but reassured the couple that he was accustomed, and partial to the taste. 
 SCP-999-J later expressed approval for specific actions performed by the subject couple on multiple occasions.

 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: A four (4) kilometer perimeter is to be set around SCP-1000-J's town limits. Entry into SCP-1000-J is only to be allowed to personnel with a security clearance level of two (2) or higher. 
 All personnel entering SCP-1000-J are to bring with them one square piece of wood measuring ten (10) cm x ten (10) cm x two (2) cm. Personnel encountering SCP-1000-J's effects are to lightly tap their knuckles on their issued planks. Under no circumstances are any mirrors, umbrellas, ladders, felines that could be considered of dark hue, video games, or containers of salt to be taken into SCP-1000-J. Any personnel with a still-living biological mother are to be warned to avoid damaged cement. 
 Any area within a five kilometer radius of SCP-1000-J is to be evacuated on any date that lies on the thirteenth of a month and a Friday. Any clovers with four-leaves sighted within SCP-1000-J are to be reported to Dr. ███████. Several preserved limbs of Oryctolagus cuniculus are to be kept for handling in emergency situations.

 Description: SCP-1000-J is a small town in Missouri, apparently called ██████████. The town appears to have been abandoned circa 1975, possibly due to its anomalous effects. SCP-1000-J manifests several effects within its town limits. 
 SCP-1000-J causes an apparent increase of probability towards misfortune if the following actions are performed: 
 SCP-1000-J causes permanent damage to either or both eyes, or unexplained permanent blindness if the following actions are performed:

 Addendum 1000-J-A: 
 Upon further investigation of SCP-1000-J a corpse was found in a local diner, slumped over a dining table. Upon the table lay an overturned salt shaker. The corpse had slashes to the carotid arteries. The body was later found to be completely exsanguinated. Only approximately ███ ml of blood was found nearby, only accounting for ██% of the missing blood.

Researchers, based on the context of the other abnormalities, hypothesized that the overturned salt shaker was related to the cause of death. Experimentation was approved by O5-██ on ██/██/20██.

The salt shaker and the salt contained within it were examined and found to be mundane. 
 Experiment Log 1000-J: 
 Experiment 1000-J-1

Subject: D-49812
Date: ██/██/20██
Method: Subject is instructed to take a seat in the diner, wait until ordered, and knock over the salt shaker.
Results: Within 2 seconds of salt being spilled an entity (hereafter referred to as SCP-1000-J-1) resembling a [DATA EXPUNGED], appeared behind the subject and [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in ██ casualties of security personnel.

Note: Testing area is to be evacuated before and during any further testing. 
 Experiment 1000-J-2

Subject: D-53157
Date: ██/██/20██
Method: Subject is instructed to take a seat in the diner, wait until ordered, knock over the salt shaker, and immediately throw salt over his left shoulder.
Results: At first personnel believed that the test had gone according to Dr. ██████'s predictions, with no appearance of 1000-J-1. Upon review of high speed cameras installed in the diner, 1000-J-1 was seen to [DATA EXPUNGED] for approximately ██ milliseconds before being struck by the salt in the area assumed to be the face, vanishing.

Note: In light of Experiment 1000-J-2, all security teams are to be equipped with at least one shotgun loaded with 1 (one) rock salt round. Rounds are to be signed in and out from the security station located at [DATA REDACTED]. Failure to return a round to its holding area will result in re-assignment to Keter-duty and/or demotion to D-class. 
 Experiment 1000-J-3

Subject: D-54813
Date: ██/██/20██
Method: Same as Experiment 1000-J-2, but subject is given a different salt shaker.
Results: Same as Experiment 1000-J-2. 
 Note: During the brief periods of time in which the previous experiments took place Dr. Clef was noted to be absent from Site-██.

 Incident 1000-J-1 
 SCP Involved: SCP-1000-J 
 Personnel Involved: Agent F██████ 
 Date: ██/██/████ 
 Location: SCP-1000-J 
 Description: 
 During routine examination of SCP-1000-J, Agent F██████ accidentally ingested the gum he had been chewing. Several hours later, Agent F██████ began complaining of severe intestinal pain. Examination by medical staff present revealed a blockage in Agent F██████'s small intestine. 
 Agent F██████'s intestine were then surgically opened. Medical personnel discovered the wad of gum Agent F██████ had been chewing earlier lodged in his duodenum. Although the gum would normally have been processed, examination of the progress made by Agent F██████'s digestive system showed that the breaking down of the wad of gum into portions small enough to travel through the digestive system would have taken an estimated seven years.

SCP-1013-J,"""Tree Rats""","""Item #: SCP-1013-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Because of the sheer size and global distribution of SCP-1013-J, containment in the strictest sense is impossible. As such, containment of SCP-1013-J consists of constant monitoring of SCP-1013-J’s activities and suppressing information about the true nature of SCP-1013-J. 
 Any official contact with SCP-1013-J must be performed by members of Mobile Task Force Zeta-00 (“Fuzzbutts”); all other Foundation personnel are strongly advised to avoid interaction with members of SCP-1013-J. Current and former rosters of Zeta-00 are restricted to personnel with O5 clearance or equivalent. 
 Personnel who find that they have accidentally run over a member of SCP-1013-J with their vehicle should vacate the area as quickly as possible. Personnel are strongly advised to not attempt to run over members of SCP-1013-J on purpose, as the consequences may be catastrophic to the individual in question (see also Incident 1013-44). 
 Description: SCP-1013-J is composed of most (if not all) members of several species of genus Sciuris, mainly the eastern gray squirrel (S. carolinensis), the fox squirrel (S. niger), the red squirrel (S. vulgaris), and the western gray squirrel (S. griseus). Members of SCP-1013-J are significantly more intelligent than are widely believed, and are suspected to be carrying out a plan to take over the world from a vast underground/arboreal complex. Most details of this plan have yet to be uncovered; however, reconnaissance agents have reported widespread combat training with a variety of weaponry and martial arts. 
 Because of the ubiquitous presence of SCP-1013-J around human habitation, a dedicated Mobile Task Force, Zeta-00 (“Fuzzbutts”), has been established to provide reconnaissance of and, when necessary, a conduit for communication with SCP-1013-J. Membership in Zeta-00 is currently restricted to members of Canis lupus familiaris and Felis catus; proposals to expand membership of Zeta-00 to other species friendly to humans are currently under consideration. 
 Incident 1013-44, 03/15/1992: Billy Hoffman, 19, from Athens, GA, was found dead in his bedroom, bound with vines, with his mouth stuffed full of BBs. Cause of death was determined to be blood loss from hundreds of scratches and bites on his person. Neighbors told authorities that Hoffman’s favorite pastime was shooting at squirrels with his BB gun. The Foundation was alerted to the unusual method of Hoffman’s passing, and quickly established a link to SCP-1013-J.

 Containment & Neutralization Summary: Formerly non-anomalous contraband held by Junior Researcher Alleyn, who has been sacked, SCP-1020-J's furry, slimy, yet simultaneously scaly and powdery form came into existence subsequently to Site-77's controlled evacuation and lockdown1. The contents of SCP-1020-J prior to this are unknown, and attempts to take samples resulted in the equipment becoming disgusting beyond usability before any readings could be made. 
 Inside of SCP-1020-J is a self-sustaining boutique blend of garbage, visually comparable to a protoplasmic cube composed of and containing the rotting curdling, self-bleach-proofed dregs, of what once may have been edible foodstuffs. 
 The stink wave unleashed by opening its door can be detected from inside a ground-level enclosed structure by sniffer dogs from a distance of 2.5 kilometers. Survivors of direct exposure have not been able to compare it to other odors due to the obliteration of their olfactory nerves. 
 1020-J Cleaning Attempt 111-331

 Materials: Chlorine-based cleaning chemicals, scrubbing and cleaning equipment, garbage bags, PPE 
 Results: During and after fifteen minutes of testing, D-0918 reported burning pain in their nose, throat, chest, ears, mouth, eyes, and skin2. Following testing, their olfactory nerves were found to have been damaged, and all of their teeth became brittle after exposure to gaseous expulsions from within SCP-1020-J.

 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1026-J is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. Personnel tasked with studies of SCP-1026-J do not need specialized equipment, as SCP-1026-J is easily subdued when not cooperative. Personnel are recommended to avoid referring to SCP-1026-J by any name to avoid passive-aggressive verbal hostilities, and the potential for SCP-1026-J's aggression to cascade to SCP-118-J levels. 
 Description: SCP-1026-J is a vaguely humanoid entity with anomalous properties that appear to affect memories and information regarding its appearance. Its antimemetic properties manifest primarily around its preferred name, which is apparently impossible to remember. Subjects who converse with SCP-1026-J believe to know its name, and will often refer to it by this name in conversation, though this name is usually incorrect and often frustrates attempts to communicate with SCP-1026-J, as it will complain whenever someone gets its name wrong. Written and digitally recorded information regarding SCP-1026-J's specific appearance and name is usually corrupted or accidentally destroyed, making it as-of-yet impossible to complete a full description of SCP-1026-J.

 Description: SCP-1040-J is an effect, first documented in 1998,1 that has spread in scope from the early 20th Century onwards to now affect the vast majority of adult humans in the United States. 
 Subjects under the influence of SCP-1040-J are beholden to a complex internal logic that, to this date, has defied all attempts at analysis. They will repeatedly display behavior harmful to themselves and others, the scope and severity of which constitutes a Keter-level threat. Left unchecked, SCP-1040-J has the potential to cause an AK-class end-of-civilization scenario. 
 Further characterization of SCP-1040-J is ongoing. 
 Incident 1040-J-264
Vehicle: 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan
Driver: Caucasian female, circa 75yo
Description: Subject 264 was observed to repeatedly attempt to move into highway traffic at circa 5-10mph below the average speed of the prevailing traffic flow, almost striking Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████'s vehicle. 
 Incident 1040-J-030
Vehicle: 2012 Dodge Ram
Driver: African-American female, est. 25yo
Description: Subject 030 was observed applying cosmetic products to her face at a stop light; when the light changed, Subject 030 suddenly accelerated, narrowly missing the vehicle of Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████. 
 Incident 1040-J-1054
Vehicle: 2007 Ford Mustang GT
Driver: Asian male, est. 40yo
Description: Subject 1054 was observed to abruptly pull into the right lane of Interstate ██ north of ██████ and immediately decelerate for no discernible reason. Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████, who was previously maintaining a sensible two-meter following distance, was forced to initiate emergency maneuvers. 
 Incident 1040-J-667
Vehicle: 2009 Ford Escape
Driver: Caucasian female, est. 30yo
Description: Subject 667 remained stopped for approx. 3 sec too long at a Stop sign when prevailing conditions clearly allowed the subject to proceed, leading another vehicle2, coming up behind, to collide with Vehicle-667's rear bumper. 
 Incident 1040-J-658
Vehicle: 2006 Honda Civic
Driver: Foundation researcher Dr. A. Estevez
Description: On ██/██/████, Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████'s vehicle was deliberately struck by that of Foundation researcher Dr. A. Estevez. Displaying typical SCP-1040-J-influenced behavior, Dr. Estevez suggested that the reason for the collision was in fact Dr. D███████ looking at text messages on his cellular phone while driving through the Site-██ parking lot. However, evidence provided by leading experts on SCP-1040-J3 suggests that the probability of such a sequence of events approaches zero.

SCP-1049-J,"""The Grim Bucket""","""Item #: SCP-1049-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Given its unique object-altering properties, SCP-1049-J is to be kept in its custom container, a 19 L (5 gallon) black plastic bucket, with the top securely fastened to it. The bucket itself is stored in Dr. █████'s office. 
 Description: SCP-1049-J is a black fluid of unknown origin and chemical makeup. Its consistency is similar to that of a cornstarch and water mixture, but slightly thinner and does not exhibit the same non-Newtonian properties. Approximately half of those exposed to SCP-1049-J report a slightly soot-like smell, which smells stronger when stirred or applied to other objects. 
 Given enough time, SCP-1049-J will 'regenerate' enough to fill any container it is placed in. Please note, however, that only the plastic bucket SCP-1049-J was discovered in is immune to its property-altering effects. 
 SCP-1049-J was discovered in 19██. Foundation officials believed that the sudden popularity of [DATA EXPUNGED] had a memetic origin. After raiding the offices in which [DATA EXPUNGED] was created, SCP-1049-J was discovered in a black, unmarked1 plastic bucket. Unfortunately for the Foundation, trace amounts of SCP-1049-J have been detected in other media for ██ years following SCP-1049-J's containment, leading to speculation that other sources of SCP-1049-J exist elsewhere. As of 20██, attempts to find other sources of SCP-1049-J have proved fruitless. 
 When SCP-1049-J is applied to any object (usually with a brush or paint roller), the object will change within 10 minutes. Complete coverage of the object being tested is not required for transformation, for SCP-1049-J will briefly 'shimmer' once enough has been placed on an object. Depending on the size and nature of the object SCP-1049-J is applied to, the transformation can range from subtle to drastic. 
 While the specifics of SCP-1049-J inspired transformation are entirely dependent on the item being altered, a few commonalities tend to exist. Objects appear more dangerous to use, or look to be constructed out of less precise methods. Iconography is more common, notably human skulls. Objects may look as though they have been unmaintained, as well. Humans exposed to SCP-1049-J suffer severe emotional changes and, at times, biological changes as well. 
 Initial Testing Logs 
 Test Author: Dr. █████
Object: Paint roller
Result: Paint roller, formerly made of light plastic, looks to be constructed out of wrought iron, with expected weight increase. Handle, formerly rubber designed for ease of use, is now a simple steel handle with leather wrapped around it. A small skull can be found on the underside of the handle.
Notes: ""Looks like we're going to need a lot of those paint rollers."" - Dr. █████ 
 Test Author: Dr. █████
Object: One (1) side of Examination Room #234343. Approximately 2 m tall and 4 m wide. Core of wall is reinforced concrete, with a 10 cm 'skin' of polished stainless steel.
Result: Stainless steel 'skin' of wall altered into large blocks of iron, with massive steel bolts in the corners to attach them to each other. Signs of significant rusting, with three (3) locations of the internal reinforcement bursting out through the iron. 3 cm spikes dot the borders.
Notes: ""I think I got tetanus just looking at this thing, to be honest with you."" - Dr. █████ 
 Test Author: Dr. █████████
Object: One (1) Bible, King James Edition
Result: Old and New Testaments have been significantly altered2, although the New Testament is much more significantly changed. Jesus is still sent as God's only son on a mission of redemption, but is much more proactive in action, eliminating those who oppose Him in elaborate, violent ways. Notable alterations include the sack of ███, and near-complete [DATA EXPUNGED].
Notes: ""Burn this now, and pray to God that You-Know-Who doesn't get their hands on this."" - Dr. █████████

Object: SCP-2558-J-█, aka ""Muffins""
Result: [DATA EXPUNGED]
Notes: ""I formally recommend we find a way to destroy SCP-1049-J."" - Dr. ███ 
 Test Author: Dr. ████████
Object: D-43134, 55-year-old African male. Crimes: Petty theft, arson. SCP-1049-J ingested orally in a water/SCP-1049-J solution.
Result: No outwardly visible effects, but subject experienced a significant burning sensation. Autopsy revealed extreme modification to the subject's digestive system. Dr. ████████████████, gastroenterologist by training, believes that subject could have consumed and digested objects such as metal, rock, and some [DATA EXPUNGED] to no ill effect.
Notes: ""When I grabbed Four Three One Three Four, the other Ds around called him 'Goat' for his ability to eat the slop we give them without retching."" - Dr. ████████ 
 Test Author: Dr. █████
Object: D-89003, 26-year-old Caucasian male. Crimes: Fraud, embezzlement. SCP-1049-J injected intramuscularly.
Result: D-89003 appears to age approximately ██ years and gains an estimated ██ kg in weight. Claims to have significant connections to both organized crime and the legal system, and is convinced he will be able to escape Foundation containment at any time he wishes.
Notes: ""So, not much difference, I suppose."" - Dr. █████ 
 Test Author: Dr. ███████
Object: D-2334, 36-year-old Caucasian male. Crimes: Murder, rape, attempted murder. SCP-1049-J injected intramuscularly.
Result: D-2334 gains extreme amounts of muscle mass in chest, arms, and legs. No change to torso. Subject acts violently, and attempts to escape confinement. Within moments, however, subject expires, possibly as a result of the Square Cube Law.
Notes: ""You know, I think a dozen or so years ago, I could have looked up to that… thing."" - Dr. ███████ 
 Addendum: As of ██/██/20██, Dr. █████ has allowed SCP-1049-J to be tested by other Foundation officials.

SPC-1057-J,"""Absence Of Punchable Shark""","""Item #: SPC-1057 
 Shark Punching Contingencies: SPC-1057 is to remain in the Lap Pool at Recreation Center 23 until a method of transfer to a smaller, private tank has been devised. In the interim, the Lap Pool is to be closed, and members redirected to Recreation Center 22 for aquatic training. 
 Description: SPC-1057 refers to an animate empty space in the shape of a tiger shark. It has no solid physical components, but is capable of displacing water through an unknown mechanism. While no one has observed SPC-1057 consuming food, early punching attempts show that it is capable of biting hands (See Acquisition Log). It is conjectured that SPC-1057 is remarkably smug about this. 
 Despite a lack of selachian anatomy, the SPC Athletic Counsel has voted to designate SPC-1057 as a standard selachian threat. The Counsel's comments are below: 
 While some may argue that SPC-1057 is literally a lack of a shark, we have decided that this does fall in of line with the central mission of the SPC. It looks like a shark. It bites like a shark. Most surely it can be punched like a shark. We will continue our innovations in Fist Integrated Stimulation Technology until SPC-1057 receives the right hook it deserves.
- SPC Counsel Member Amy Tulls 
 Aquisition: SPC-1057 was discovered within the Lap Pool at Recreation Center 23. Two SPC personnel were killed, and fourteen were injured during various attempts to punch SPC-1057. Unfortunately, all such attempts failed, due to the lack of physical shark within the pool. During further examination of the Recreation Center bulletin boards, Document 1057-S24 was located.

SCP-1089-J,"""The Carpet Ate It Again""","""Item #: SCP-1089-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Texts additional to the master copy describing SCP-1089-J are to be actively sought by Foundation plants1 within occult communities. Recovered copies are to be safeguarded in a standard security folder and placed inside drawer 3C in room 29B of Site-21. Texts are to remain there until such a time that their authenticity can be verified independently by no less than three Foundation thaumaturgists who hold speciality licensing in Kinetology. Once confirmed, the texts are to be either incinerated, placed into dedicated anomalospatial landfills, or given that they meet the prerequisites, become subject to their own instructions. 
 Description: SCP-1089-J is an kinetologic incantation that results in the instantaneous dematerialization of a targeted object. SCP-1089-J requires no expertise or familiarity in thaumaturgical applications on the part of the practitioner,2 and has been successfully performed by those of no prior ability and prowess. 
 Texts describing SCP-1089-J identify the following prerequisites to be present at the time of the incantation: 
 After satisfying the above conditions, the practitioner must inadvertently drop the target object within the designated incantatory area. The practitioner is not to visually track the object’s descent, if SCP-1089-J is to be performed correctly. 
 The practitioner is to then kneel upon the incantatory area with flexion at the hip and knees, such that the face is in close proximity to the surface. SCP-1089-J requires the practitioner to kinetologically place their palms upon the surface of the incantatory area and make repeated, pan-directional sweeping motions, preferably in large swaths. 
 Radiochemical tagging has confirmed that the target object dematerializes gradually, and in direct proportion to the haste with which the kinetological motions are performed. Once the entirety of the incantatory area has been canvassed by the practitioner, the incantation is considered complete. Researchers and thaumaturgists have at no time recovered a target object that has been made subject to SCP-1089-J.

 2. Interview with Walden Mollis 
 The following interview was conducted with Level 5 Thumaturge Walden Mollis to ascertain potential recovery options for objects lost to SCP-1089-J, many of which were sorely needed back, especially at the time of their hexing. Level 4 Researcher Dr. Emeri Tuss facilitating. 
 The following interview has been transcribed by a Foundation-certified stenographer.

 Dr. Tuss: Walden… 
 Mollis: …yes? 
 Dr. Tuss: …how are you? 
 Mollis: …good. 
 Dr. Tuss: You're a Level 5 Thumaturge here, is that correct? 
 Mollis: That's why I'm here. You know this already. 
 Dr. Tuss: I see. 
 (Pause) 
 Mollis: Is there something else, some certain data perhaps, that you are wanting to get from me…? 
 Dr. Tuss: …hmm. Hmmm. 
 Mollis: (Sighs) I'm well aware that your superiors like your interview hours to exceed a minimum quota and all, but I really don't have time for this. Let's get on with what we both know we're here for. 
 Dr. Tuss: Fair enough. Now. Thumaturge… Mollis, was it? 
 Mollis: Yes for Christ's sake! 
 Dr. Tuss: Ah. I see. (Writes on notepad) 
 Mollis: If you don't ask the one fucking question we are all three here for right this second, I am going to anatomically flip your lips and your anal sphincter.

SCP-1111-J,"""A Working Computer""","""Item #: SCP-1111-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1111-J is to be stored in a purpose-built room in Site 26 with several electrical sockets for it and for testing equipment. It is not to be connected to other computers except under strict testing conditions. When testing is complete, all computers that were connected to SCP-1111-J are to be tested for anomalous efficiency levels. If they are shown to be unusually workable, then they are to be stored as possible duplicates of SCP-1111-J; otherwise, they are to be destroyed. 
 SCP-1111-J is not to be connected to the internet under any circumstances. Site 26 is forbidden to maintain more than one (landline) connection to the internet. In the event of SCP-1111-J becoming connected to the internet, Site 26 is to detonate hidden C4 charges at various points along its landline connection, and contact Command by radio for further orders. 
 Description: SCP-1111-J is a [BRAND REDACTED] computer which has never experienced a recorded fault of any sort, and which maintains the actual computing power it was advertised as having. It was discovered when computers in a Foundation office were being updated. Every other computer froze at least once — with several overheating to the point of melting their casing or catching fire — except SCP-1111-J. At that time, it was discovered that no errors had ever been recorded on the machine. It will run any viable program without fail. 
 It is unknown how SCP-1111-J maintains its remarkable computing power. No such machine has been shown to have similar qualities and no unusual parts, unknown programs, remarkable power usage, ectoplasm, unusual religious atmosphere, miraculous events, crying statues, healing events, ghosts, technovampires, entities of pure energy, or mysterious voices have been detected near SCP-1111-J, despite daily sweeps of its room and careful monitoring of all known variables. 
 SCP-1111-J has proven capable of maintaining its anomalous properties even while connected to a normal computer of the same brand which was infected with several viruses. Due to this, it is theorised that if SCP-1111-J were to maintain a connection with the internet for even a short amount of time, the world's networks could become dangerously efficient. 
 We need to find out what makes this machine tick. If we had but twenty of these, our clerical costs would go down by 67%. Testing should be re-opened. - Dr. Smallwood. 
 Fine, but you will be held personally responsible for any incidents incurred by testing. - O5-11. 
 SCP-1111-J Test Log
Chief Researcher: Dr. Smallwood 
 Test 1
Note that SCP-1111-J is currently running its default operating system at default settings.
Dr. Smallwood installed a word processor known to break down frequently, and typed up several documents without error. 
 Test 2
Dr. Smallwood typed out a text document with several deliberate errors, and then activated the spellcheck function. The spellcheck caught all grammatical and spelling errors, and did not create any new errors while solving them. No errors noted.
Amazing! If they all worked like this no one would ever be told to ""consult an alchemist"" again!"" - Dr. Smallwood 
 Test 3
Dr. Smallwood left a word processor with a finished but unsaved document alone while he left to have a cup of tea and do a crossword. Upon his return, no errors had occurred, nor did any occur as he saved the file and exited the program. 
 Test 4
Dr. Smallwood attempted to disable the stylised ""helpful mascot"" on the word processor. When he exited the program and then entered again, the mascot did not spontaneously activate. After Dr. Smallwood restarted the machine and opened the program, the mascot did not spontaneously activate. He repeated this several times, and the mascot still did not spontaneously activate. 
 Test 5
Dr. Smallwood attempted to exit a word processor with an open unsaved file. The word processor prompted him to save before exiting and he did so. The program did not freeze while saving or prompting. No errors noted. 
 Test 6
Upon realising that new updates were available for [OS REDACTED], Dr. Smallwood saved them to a small specialised network, created a program to inform SCP-1111-J of the updates, and connected SCP-1111-J to the network. SCP-1111-J prompted Dr. Smallwood to allow it to complete updates, allowed him to postpone the updates, and restarted without incident when the update was complete. 
 Test 7
Dr. Smallwood installed an antivirus program onto SCP-1111-J before infecting it with a basic computer virus. The virus was immediately detected, quarantined and deleted. No errors occurred. 
 Test 8
Dr. Smallwood installed an additional antivirus program before testing for conflicts. When no conflicts were found, he added another antivirus program, and repeated the test. After thirteen antivirus programs had been added, with no conflicts resulting, he ceased testing for the day.
Seriously, what - Dr. Smallwood 
 Test 9
Dr. Smallwood connected SCP-1111-J to a virtual network and opened a commonly-used email client, upon which he had placed a full contact list including some contacts marked with notes like ""boss,"" ""potential client"" and ""wife."" He wrote a short offensive e-mail and used the ""send to many"" function to send it to several contacts, not including those with notes. The e-mail was sent to the intended addresses and not to the addresses marked with notes.""",,+200,active,computer electronic joke safe scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1111-j
SCP-1131-J,"""It works, guys! Trust me!""","""Item #: SCP-1131 
 Object Class: Thaumiel 
 Special Containment Procedures: All members of the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, and the Site Director Executive Council of the Whole are to utilize SCP-1131 at all times on a 24/7 basis. 
 Description: SCP-1131 refers to a method utilized by the Unusual Incidents Unit used to counter the effects of cognitohazardous entities. 
 SCP-1131 operates in an autonomous function when the subject using the method has encountered a cognitohazardous entity.1 
 The mind, when affected by a cognitohazardous entity, will undergo a series of chemical changes heavily varying based upon the goal and power of said entity. These chemical changes are the main source of the properties shown on the affected subject, IE: loss of motor function, memory alteration, and ""mind-control."" 
 These chemical changes can be completely counteracted via any amount of the element tin (symbol Sn, atomic number 50), but only if the tin is covering the majority of the top of the skull. This is commonly achieved via hand-shaped tinfoil wrapped around the head in a fashion similar to a hat. This method is SCP-1131. 
 SCP-1131 works due to the fact that the cognitohazardous properties, auras, and effects that an entity may give out cannot travel through closed tinfoil under any circumstances (with the exception of very few entities; research is ongoing). 
 Addendum: The following is a collection of test logs of SCP-1131. Researcher Roy G. Caroll is the overseer for all tests involving SCP-1131. 
 Procedure: A D-Class personnel (D-1131-1) is to be introduced to SCP-035's containment chamber. The subject is then to be questioned as to the effects they are feeling. 
 Results: D-1131-1 felt no compulsion to don SCP-035. During the test, SCP-035's smile altered into a frown. Following the conclusion of the test, SCP-035 has been extremely uncooperative and pouty because it ""got defeated by a fucking tinfoil hat."" 
 Attempts to make SCP-035 more cooperative during testing is ongoing. 
 Object: SCP-3213 
 Procedure: SCP-1131 is to be used on a southern elephant seal. SCP-3213 is then to be introduced into the seal's direct line of sight. 
 Results: SCP-3213 had no effect on the seal. Following introduction to the seal in a controlled testing chamber, SCP-3213 burst out into tears and said the interaction was ""the best moment of his life"" because he was ""finally able to hug a seal."" 
 Addendum: SCP-3213 is currently scheduled to go on a date with the elephant seal it has since named ""Darla."" 
 Object: SCP-055 
 Procedure: A Foundation researcher using SCP-1131 is to be exposed to SCP-055 to see if it has any effect against the object's antimemetic properties. 
 Results: See transcript below.

SCP-1132-J,"""Head-Cannons""","""Item #: SCP-1132 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to the high percentage of personnel affected by SCP-1132, the lack of evidence suggesting that SCP-1132 may have any negative effects on the mental or physical welfare of such personnel, as well as having passed all memetic hazard screening and quarantine requirements, personnel affected by SCP-1132 are allowed to continue working unless deemed unstable or dangerous by psychiatric or medical staff. 
 SCP-1132-affected personnel are to be reminded that their afflictions cannot be used as an excuse to disregard standard procedures or violate Foundation safety guidelines. Foundation personnel affected by SCP-1132 are strictly prohibited from arming and firing their instances of SCP-1132. 
 Description: SCP-1132 is an anomalous phenomenon that affects Foundation personnel, especially those involved in the transcription of documents or records. Personnel affected by SCP-1132 will develop a cranial growth over the course of their employment that will gradually form into a fully functional artillery cannon. The specific type of artillery formed by SCP-1132 varies from subject to subject; to date, no two instances have been precisely alike. 
 Personnel affected by SCP-1132 also gain a tendency to argue extensively about the specific pros and cons of their particular instance. While this does not appear to be any kind of harmful compulsion or memetic effect, personnel are encouraged to minimize such interaction due to the negative impact on productivity and to remember that each individual's SCP-1132 instance is unique and perfectly acceptable as it is.

SCP-1134-J,"""Masking Tape""","""Item #: SCP-1134-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1134-J is to be kept in a locked drawer in Doctor ████’s office. No further containment measures are deemed necessary to contain SCP-1134-J. 
 Description: SCP-1134-J is a roll of tan masking tape, approximately 4 cm in width. The labels on the interior of the roll suggest that it is the bad kind manufactured by ██. 
 SCP-1134-J’s anomalous properties are manifested when a human subject, henceforth referred to as SCP-1134-J-A, attempts to tear off a piece of SCP-1134-J. Instances of SCP-1134-J-A seem to be opposed to using scissors or any kind of a blade when attempting to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. 
 When SCP-1134-J-A removes a piece of SCP-1134-J, SCP-1134-J will tear at a point that SCP-1134-J-A did not intend, regardless of how much care was invested in doing so. This causes an unusually large amount of frustration in SCP-1134-J-A, often causing SCP-1134-J-A to attack SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J also seems to be impervious to all attempts to damage it by SCP-1134-J-A, and attempts to do so also seem to cause additional frustration in SCP-1134-J-A.

 D-23867 attempts to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J, but the piece tears diagonally, forming an irregular trapezoid. 
 D-23867: Oh, that brand, huh? That always [EXPLETIVE] happens! 
 Doctor ████: D-23867, please attempt to remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J. 
 D-23867: Yeah, well [EXPLETIVE] that. 
 D-23867 complies, but SCP-1134-J once again tears diagonally. 
 D-23867: [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-23867 throws SCP-1134-J at the opposite wall of the containment chamber. 
 Doctor ████: D-23867, please refrain from throwing SCP-1134-J, or you will be removed from the testing chamber. Please remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J. 
 D-235867: [EXPLETIVE] THAT! YOU [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-23867 slows his breathing, and paces around the room. After 3 minutes, D-23867 once again attempts to remove a piece from SCP-1134-J, slowly. 
 D-23867: Okay, this time I’m gonna get it. 
 D-23867 begins to slowly tear SCP-1134-J, but then it tears slightly diagonally. 
 D-23867: No no no no no no no no no no no no no… 
 D-23867 re-adjusts his grip, and continues to tear SCP-1134-J, but SCP-1134-J tears perpendicular to the tear D-23867 was attempting to make 
 D-23867: [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-23867 throws SCP-1134-J against the opposite wall in the containment chamber, then strikes the wall adjacent to him. Later examination of D-23867 showed that his wrist broke due to this strike. 
 D-23867: [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-23867, clutching his wrist, walks to SCP-1134-J, then begins to repeatedly stomp on SCP-1134-J. 
 D-23867: [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-23867 is forcefully removed from the testing chamber by two D-class personnel, but D-23867 breaks free and begins striking SCP-1134-J repeatedly. The two D-class personnel once again grab D-23867, and, with greater force this time, remove D-23867 from the testing chamber. 
 D-23867: [EXPLETIVE] YOU, YOU LITTLE [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE], [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] YOU! [EXPLETIVE] ALL OF YOU [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-23867 is removed from the testing area. The subject appears to be extremely frustrated, however returns to an ordinary psychological state after 14 hours. Post-test examination of SCP-1134-J showed that no damage was inflicted on SCP-1134-J. 
 Analysis: SCP-1134-J seems to cause extreme frustration in those attempting to remove a piece from it. Further experiments are required to find the extent of SCP-1134-J’s “unrippablity”. 
 Test SCP-1134-J-2 
 Subject: D-49856 
 Procedure: D-49856 is placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a one-way mirror for viewing by Doctor ████. Also within the chamber is SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber, and a standard pair of scissors. 
 Results: 
 D-49856: A roll of tape? I can’t wait to see what this one does… 
 Doctor ████: Please remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J. 
 D-49856 complies, and similar to the previous test, SCP-1134-J tears diagonally, causing frustration in D-49856. 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-49856 attempts again to remove a piece from SCP-1134-J, without being instructed to do so. This attempt is once again met with failure, as a tear forms that is approximately 12 cm long, along one edge of SCP-1134-J. 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! WHAT THE [EXPLETIVE] KIND OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] IS THIS?! 
 Doctor ████: D-49856, please try to stay calm. Use the scissors we have supplied you to cut a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J. 
 D-49856: OH, [EXPLETIVE] THAT! If I can’t rip a [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] piece of tape, then what the [EXPLETIVE] am I [EXPLETIVE] good for? 
 D-49856 kicks the supplied pair of scissors to the far corner of the testing chamber, and once again attempts to tear a piece off of SCP-1134-J. The tear previously made grew an additional 14 cm as this piece was torn off, causing D-49856 to become extremely agitated and angry. 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-49856 attempts to rip SCP-1134-J into two pieces. After 12 seconds without success, D-49856 holds SCP-1134-J to the wall of the testing chamber, and repeatedly strikes SCP-1134-J. None of these measures seemed to have an effect on the structural integrity of SCP-1134-J. 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! 
 Doctor ████: D-49856, please stop your attacks towards SCP-1134-J, or you will be removed from the testing chamber. 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE] THAT! I [EXPLETIVE]… I… Why am I so mad? 
 D-49856 puts SCP-1134-J back on the floor of the testing chamber, and sits down in the eastern corner. 
 Doctor ████: Please remove a rectagular- 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE] off! I’m [EXPLETIVE] trying to… AAAH! Stop it! 
 After 8 minutes, and statements from D-49856 was “cooled off” D-49856 attempts with her hands to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J tears at a slight angle, but this seems to cause only minor annoyance with D-49856. She attempts again, slowly, to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. However it tears in the middle, separating SCP-1134-J into two halves. This causes D-49856 to once again attack SCP-1134-J, this time striking it repeatedly with her head. Several other D-class personnel enter the test chamber to intervene. D-49856 grabs one of the D-class’s firearms and repeatedly shoots SCP-1134-J at a range of approximately 1.4 meters. Of the 7 shots fired at SCP-1134-J, 5 are confirmed hits on SCP-1134-J. The D-class then forcefully grab D-49856, and remove her from the testing chamber. 
 D-49856: [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! I’LL [EXPLETIVE] KILL THAT [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] YOU ALL, YOU [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] YOU, DOCTOR ████! [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-49856 is placed into temporary containment for psychological evaluation. 5 hours after being removed from the testing chamber, D-49856 seems to have returned to an ordinary psychological state. The 5 hits on SCP-1134-J seem to have had no effect. 
 Analysis: SCP-1134-J-A seems to choose against using scissors when cutting SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J-A is confirmed to have an emotional response to SCP-1134-J. Also, SCP-1134-J is extremely resistant to damage. Further testing is required to see how indestructible SCP-1134-J is. 
 Doctor ████: “Is further testing concerning SCP-1134-J’s indestructibility approved?” 
 O5-██:”Yes”. 
 Test SCP-1134-J-3 
 Subject: D-99214 
 Procedure: D-99214 is placed in a reinforced humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with several reinforcing steel plates lining the chamber. Also within the chamber is an of SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber, several aluminum bats, axes, handguns, rifles, knives, and hand grenades. 
 Results: 
 Doctor ████: D-99214, You may attempt to destroy SCP-1134-J in any way you deem necessary. 
 D-99214: Um, okay. 
 D-99214 takes the an axe from the ground of the testing chamber and attempts to cut SCP-1134-J. Despite a direct hit, no damage seemed to be caused to SCP-1134-J. 
 D-99214: [EXPLETIVE]! How did it do that? 
 D-99214 is visibly frustrated, and once again hits SCP-1134-J with the selected axe, again with no effect. D-99214 then changes weapons to an AK-47 assault rifle, and opens fire on SCP-1134-J. Due to the angle of cameras in the testing chamber, no shots are confirmed hits on SCP-1134-J, but post-test analysis of audio showed that 37 shots were fired. Again, no damage is visible on SCP-1134-J. 
 D-99214: [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! WHAT A LOAD OF [EXPLETIVE]! I’M [EXPLETIVE] DONE WITH [EXPLETIVE] THIS PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE]! 
 D-99214 throws the previously selected AK-47 at SCP-1134-J, striking it directly. Then, D-99214 selects a hand grenade from the available arsenal and throws it at SCP-1134-J. It detonates 0.6 meters from SCP-1134-J, and sends it towards the far wall of the chamber. D-99214 is unharmed, and then proceeds to attack SCP-1134-J with a knife provided. With every strike on SCP-1134-J, D-99214 grows more frustrated and angry. 
 D-99214: I’M GOING TO [EXPLETIVE] KILL THIS [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] THING! I- 
 D-99214 suddenly falls to the floor of the testing chamber. Several D-class personnel are sent in to investigate, and D-99214 is then removed to from the testing chamber. D-99214 is declared deceased by sudden cardiac arrest upon removal from the testing chamber, and is then removed from the site. Post-test examination revealed no damage on the surface of SCP-1134-J 
 Analysis: None of the aforementioned tools/weapons seem to have an effect on the structural integrity of SCP-1134-J.

 Object Class: Cannot be classified using available means. 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1150-J is located in the backyard of the administrative bunkhouse in Area 22/13 (Bum███k, Russia), guarded by two (2) dogs due to lack of more suitable housing and severe staff shortage. Experiments with SCP-1150-J are suspended indefinitely due to absence of qualified researchers and lack of available test subjects; all Area 22/13 D-class personnel have been assigned to labour at Area 22/13 household plot in order to alleviate present food shortage. 
 Proposal that SCP-1150-J be moved to another Foundation facility is pending indefinite review until suitable transportation and fuel arrives and access roads are repaired as necessary. 
 MTF Phi-13, ""Broke Blokes"" is assigned to work with the local populace in order to conceal the existence of SCP-1150-J. on an ongoing strike due to not having received their salary for the last ██ months. 
 This document will be registered in the Foundation database as soon as Area 22/13 electricity bill is paid and communication is restored; until then it is to be stored in Area Director ██████skiy's desk drawer along with other important documents. 
 Description: SCP-1150-J is a sculpture made from low-quality concrete, depicting a disembodied human arm bent halfway with another hand gripping its biceps. The sculpture is approximately (last tape measure in Area 22/13 was lost during Incident ██.██.20██) 1.5 meters tall and can be carried by four (4) properly fed Foundation employees. 
 The object's anomalous effect initially spread to supply agent ██████off and chief accountant █████va; both started having repeating nightmares in which SCP-1150-J is depicted as the arms and hands of a humanoid entity whose face and other distinctive features match ██████off's and █████va's immediate superior ██████skiy. Other Area 22/13 employees also reported having similar nightmares, particularly often the nights before paydays. 
 Addendum: The object was initially found on the grounds of Area 22/13 storage area (abandoned due to absence of demand) by Saveliy Semyonovich, the Area warden, during a routine patrol (actually conducted for the first time in 20██ due to said warden's alcoholism). After SCP-1150-J was contained and the warden was questioned and severely reprimanded, he was issued two (2) bottles of 80 proof amnestic, with the side effect of partially amnestifying the extent of his wage arrears.""","""SCP-1150-J photograph1 artist's2 chief accountant █████va's depiction""",+96,active,_cc artifact esoteric-class international joke mind-affecting scp sculpture,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1150-j
SCP-1162-J,"""""Double Down Sandwich""""","""Item #: SCP-1162-J 
 Object Class: Safe (pending review) 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1162-J must be stored under Biosafety Level 4 conditions. Under no circumstances may SCP-1162-J be handled without adequate BSL-4 protection or by personnel not in full Class A hazmat gear. Personnel who have been exposed to SCP-1162-J are to be subject to post-mortem incineration. In the case of containment compromise, full nuclear sterilization is considered automatically authorized. 
 Description: Inspection reveals SCP-1162-J to be similar in form to an ordinary bacon-and-cheese sandwich. Two slices of cheese are present within the sandwich, determined to be ████████ ████ and ██████ ████. Sauce of undetermined composition has also been located within the sandwich. SCP-1162-J's anomalous properties result from its bun, which is composed entirely of fried chicken. Despite this deviation from ordinary sandwich structure, SCP-1162-J maintains its sandwich designation through unknown means. 
 SCP-1162-J was deposited into Foundation care on ██/██/████, by Agent ███████, who had spent the previous two weeks on leave. Agent ███████, after ensuring SCP-1162-J's prompt containment, left directions for immolation and promptly committed suicide. Elevated levels of sodium were indeed found within the corpse prior to destruction. The ultimate origin of SCP-1162-J is not known. Packaging originally found with SCP-1162-J at the time of containment identifies it as a Kentucky Fried Chicken ""Double Down"" sandwich, but Foundation scientists have judged it unlikely that any such product would have been designed by said company or produced on a large scale, being entirely inconsistent with all previous definitions of ""sandwich"" as well as its property of inducing violent revulsion in human subjects. The effects of direct exposure to SCP-1162-J have never been observed, but are assumed to be rapid heart failure followed by death. Consumption in part or whole has been theorized to have the result of [DATA EXPUNGED] hazardous concentrations of sodium remaining in the corpses necessitating [DATA EXPUNGED] damage to nearby unprotected human subjects. 
 Addendum: Testimony from research personnel assigned to SCP-1162-J has raised the possibility of a psychic lure effect emanating from SCP-1162-J, intensifying with exposure over time. This hypothetical effect manifests as a compulsion to consume part of SCP-1162-J, despite knowledge of health risks and the near-certainty of permanent physiological damage to be incurred by such an action, described as a ""morbid curiosity"". As a precaution, staff rotation has been instituted. 
 Addendum: Unverified reports have been forthcoming regarding sightings of additional instances of SCP-1162-J in the wild. I need not remind you of the potential hazard posed to the public by such manifestations. All agents have been cleared for unlimited funding with the aim of containing as many instances of SCP-1162-J as possible.

SCP-1212-J,"""Standards""","""Item #: SCP-1212 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: The original instance of SCP-1212 is to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-12. All additional instances are to be contained in a Size- 1 2 3 6 Containment Locker directly adjacent to the original instance's containment locker. Under no circumstances aside from deposition of new instances of SCP-1212 is the secondary containment locker to be opened. Once every three (3) weeks, one D-class is to be introduced to SCP-1212. Said D-class is to remain under observation until expiring, at which point the original instance will be separated and placed in its containment locker and the remaining instances stored in secondary containment. 
 Note: Due to possible psychic effects discovered during staff interviews following Incident 1212-Delta, Containment and research on SCP-1212 is to be undertaken solely by Junior Researchers and other personnel who still think Able is ""the coolest fucking 'SPC' we have,"" as they appear to be immune. 
 Description: SCP-1212 is an indestructible ivory bracelet with diameter of 10 cm, 2 cm. thick, with two extremely sharp spikes directly polar to each other pointing outwards from the center. Inspection reveals that it is a single, unaltered piece of bone, leading researchers to believe that it is a notch from the spinal column of a currently unknown creature. SCP-1212 contains trace amounts of dark matter within the bone. It is unknown at this time whether this is the cause of its anomalous effects. 
 When coming within one (1) meter of SCP-1212, subjects with no prior knowledge of its effects experience a strong compulsion to wear it. When placed on any limb of the body, SCP-1212's spikes will turn inward and the bracelet itself will contract to clamp tightly around the limb. Subjects will typically report extreme pain following the impalement of the limb, and at this point will attempt to remove SCP-1212. It is impossible to remove SCP-1212 following impalement. 
 Over the course of three hours, the subject's spinal notches will become hollow, and widen to a diameter of 10 cm. Two spikes will grow on each notch. When three hours have elapsed, each spinal notch will detach itself from the subject by rotating at a speed of 2000 rpm. All spinal notches are identical in appearance and effect to the original instance of SCP-1212, save for two details: 
 Incident 1212-Delta Aftermath Interview Log 
 On ██/██/████, all instances of SCP-1212 breached containment, resulting in a total of 3,128 fatalities. The following interview was conducted in the aftermath of the event between Dr. ████, the Researcher who initially reported SCP-1212, and Drs. ███, ██████, and Researcher ████, all Level 4 researchers who had been in charge of the containment of SCP-1212, who had been out getting smoothies during the breach. 
 Dr. ████: Not only did the three of you ignore the clear, three-week deadline, but you out-and-out ignored the item completely! Why?
Researcher ████: It's boring.
Dr. ████: …what?
Dr. ██████: Yeah, it's just a cliche, indestructible, cursed magical item what kills you. That's it.
Dr. ████: That's it?! 3,128 people died because of this SCP!
Researcher ████: Exactly! That's just cheap horror. Like, ""Oooh, this thing is so dangerous. It killed so many people."" No substance, no hook, nothing at all. Like, what's its backstory? How did we find it?
Dr. ████: Huh? What are you talking about? We found it in an abandoned mine after a miner went missing and died, but what does that have to do with anything?
Dr. ███: It has to do with everything. That backstory is boring, and kind of implausible. We don't investigate every death in the world. It just doesn't add anything. Maybe you could change it?
Dr. ████: What the fuck do you mean, ""change it?!"" That's what actually happened!
Dr. ██████: Hey, buddy, calm down. We're just trying to help make it better.
Dr. ████: Better? This… THING fucking KILLS PEOPLE!
Dr. ███: Yes, yes. We've been over that. Now I have to ask, dark matter? Really?
Researcher ████: Oh yeah. That bugged the crap out of me. Dark matter hasn't actually been proven to exist.
Dr. ██████: Yeah. Downvote for pointless dark matter.
Dr. ████: It HAS been proven to exist! WE just proved it exists! You're scientists! Why aren't you shitting your pants with excitement?!
Dr. ███: That's another thing. Your tone. It's really off. I don't believe a scientist would really say that in an official interview. I'm afraid it's downvote for me.

SCP-1224-J,"""Duck-Class Personnel""","""Item #: SCP-1224-J 
 Object Class: Thaumiel 
 Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-1224-J are to be contained within standard humanoid cells within Sites that require humanoid testing. Instances of SCP-1224-J are to be fed rations consistent with Document DC-Tau-2016. Testing with instances of SCP-1224-J is to be granted by staff no lower than level 3. 
 Description: SCP-1224-J is a large body of individuals used in testing commonly referred to as ""D-Class"". SCP-1224-J instances are labelled as D-[Numerical Designation] for ease of use. Currently SCP-1224-J instances inhabit parts of Western Europe, Eastern England, Northern Ireland, United States, Mexico, Caribbean, New Zealand, Victoria, New South Wales, Pakistan, India, Japan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Vietnam, Bolivia, the Philippines, China, Madagascar, Eurasia, Canada, and Siberia. MTF-ΝΕΣ (""Lightgun"") are responsible for capturing and bringing in instances of SCP-1224-J. 
 SCP-1224-J was determined to be anomalous due to the sheer number of instances which possess, among other things, a temperament which is conducive to holding for long periods of time, and testing of potentially dangerous objects. Due to the readily available number, instances of SCP-1224-J are to be used to conduct experiments which are deemed too dangerous for research staff, and are considered expendable. 
 Ethical concerns with using SCP-1224-J for duck testing have been raised, and been deemed acceptable by the Ethics Committee, with the exception of Dr. [REDACTED]. Dr [REDACTED]'s concerns were considered negligible due to the importance of SCP-1224-J in testing various objects. 
 In addition to testing with SCP-1224-J, at the end of each month, instances of SCP-1224-J are to be terminated in order to prevent rioting, potential security breaches, and additional shankings. (See Incident Log Q-Utah-Alpha-Charlie-Kilo) 
 This termination is to be carried out under the supervision of Dr. Crowe. 
 Additional issues were raised by Dr. [REDACTED] as to the ethical rationale for termination of SCP-1224-J instances. 
 Dr. Crowe's Note
Ladies and Gentlemen. While I understand the difficulties of the Ethics Committee, I want you to recognize that this is for the future of all mankind. We need to be realists here. We need ducks to be tested on. We need them in large quantities. SCP-1224-J are neccessary. Therefore, I overrule Dr [REDACTED]'s concern that we're treating these people inhumanely. This is correct. They are ducks. 
 O5-7's Note
While I completely understand, and even sympathize with Dr [REDACTED], I think her tenure on the Ethics Committee must come to a close. Personal crusades are a noble thing, but SCP-1224-J are the reason that we can contain objects to this day. I feel nothing but gratitude for their years of service, but, due to the nature of their objections, and obvious ties to D-[REDACTED], must recommend their termination at this time. 
 Dr. [REDACTED]'s final note to the Ethics Committee:
By now I'm dead. They've found out my connection to my sister. There's no way they'll let me live, not after all I've done. I implore you, please, the terminations have to stop. There's just no reason, they're innocent for god's sake! You can't do this. I can't do this. Not after what they did to Mallardry. Faithfully yours, Dr. [REDUCKTED]

 Special Containment Procedures: Mobile Task Force Mambo-5 (""Honeymooners"") is currently assigned to the tracking and recovery of SCP-1256-J instances. All exposed subjects are to be administered antimemory juice, then coated in honey, rolled in a mixture of pollen and bee ketamine,1 dressed in a flower costume and buried waist-down in an open field. This process has no relevance to containment success of SCP-1256-J, we just thought it would boost morale.2 
 Description: SCP-1256-J is a 420-page pamphlet entitled 'Bees - Dumb as Fuck, Much More So than You Could Possibly Imagine'. Contents reveal a passionate manifesto on how bees suck at pretty much every facet of their existence, as well as with all the relationship/occupational roles one can have as a human. It appears intended to be informational in nature; however, most of it is nonsensical. The cover of the pamphlet claims it is written by a P. Honeyname, however, no records of such name exis—ohh, I get it. Never mind. 
 When SCP-1256-J is read cover-to-cover, readers (Now designated SCP-1256-J-1) will perceive all members of the superfamily Apoidea as sapient and highly annoying/needy. Contrary to its title, SCP-1256's effect applies to all members of Apoidea including wasps, and also a few unrelated insects like ladybugs and cicadas, although the reason for this is not known. SCP-1256-J-1 instances insist insects invasively invade insides, insufficient investigations in intelligence institution into innards, instead interrupting insanity; inserted interesting interim illiter—alliteration. Damn it. Sigh.

 Bees - Dumb as Fuck, Much More So than You Could Possibly Imagine 
 I bet you think bees are just bees. Don't you? Well?? Ha!—I knew it. 
 Guess what? You're wrong. Bees are not even bees, not at all are they bees. Zero bees are bees, and not by a longshot. 
 You poor, ignorant fool. 
 How I wish I could push it all out of my mind—the constant buzzing,3 their incessant wittle wingflaps, their fuzzy buzzybutts. I yearn for death—A quiet, beeless death. 
 COPING WITH THE EXISTENCE OF BEES 
 IS BEE PROOF THERE IS NO GOD??

 F.A.Q. 
 Item #: SCP-1294-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1294-J is to be kept in an anomalous item locker when not being used for testing. Oak wood restraints painted cyan and reinforced with lead-telekill-iron-oxide alloy have been attached to the object to prevent spills. 
 At least four Level-2 and two Level-3 security personnel are to guard the vault to prevent theft. One D-class (currently D-41562) is to prepare and consume Earl Grey tea from SCP-1294-J once daily under pain of termination and/or revocation of shower privileges. Despite SCP-1294-J posing no threat of containment breach if simply left alone, its object class has been upgraded to Euclid for dramatic effect. 
 Description: SCP-1294-J  is  appears to be (see Addendum 1294-J-2) a light green plastic watering can. The object is capable of dispensing an unlimited amount of water when poured from its spout, and consuming an unlimited amount of liquid when poured into its top opening. The object is impervious to damage, and all attempts to destroy it (see Document 1294-08, termination testing) have resulted in failure and short-circuited electronics. Personnel have reported that drinking from SCP-1294-J tastes ""wet"" and ""water-like"". 
 SCP-1294-J was created in 19██ by Ralph Green, designated PoI-1111, after [RELEVANT DATA EXPUNGED], which resulted in ███ cases of [REDACTED]. After numerous casualties, the object was successfully contained at Site-01. An exception to ""green site status"" was made for this anomaly due to its ability to provide water for the site, reducing the risk of a poisoned water supply or drought. However, as A-class personnel are prohibited from coming into contact with anomalies, water from regular sources is used instead. 
 Addendum 1294-J-1: Recovery Log 
 Foreword: Mobile Task Force Beta-14 (""O5-7's Antique Roadshow Collectors"") was assigned to retrieve SCP-1294-J from its location of discovery.

 Researcher Person: Hello Mr. Green. How are you doing today? 
 PoI-1111 laughs. 
 PoI-1111: Finally, my presence is recognized. Please, do sit down. 
 Researcher Person: I am already seated. 
 PoI-1111: Quite excellent. Are you having a fine day? Extraordinary weather we've been having. 
 Researcher Person: Why did you create SCP-1294-J? 
 PoI-1111: SC-what now? 
 Researcher Person: You know, the watering can. 
 PoI-1111: Why don't you just call it that? 
 Researcher Person: That is potentially ambiguous. Please tell us about its creation. 
 PoI-1111: Fine. A long time ago, I was in dire need you see, dire need. 
 Researcher Person: In need of what? 
 PoI-1111: It was a dark and stormy night, dark, rolling clouds overhead, occasionally interrupted by bright lightning, seeming to shake the firmament itself. Rain fell as if to cause a second great flood. 
 Researcher Person: I see, so you needed an umbrella. 
 PoI-1111: Precisely. 
 Researcher Person: SCP-1294-J is not an umbrella. 
 PoI-1111: Ah! It appears to not be an umbrella. 
 Researcher Person: So it is an umbrella? 
 PoI-1111: If it is used correctly, indeed. 
 Researcher Person: Can you clarify? 
 PoI-1111 laughs and strokes his chin. 
 PoI-1111: Oh, so foolish. You Foundation folk shall never understand the power of the reverse hidden umbrella. 
 Researcher Person: I still don…

SCP-1322-J,"""A Whole New World""","""Item #: SCP-1322-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-1322-J is effectively self-containing, minimal security is required. The break room is to be shut down indefinitely and restricted solely for testing. Testing is currently focused on gaining access to SCP-1322-J-1. Should a site containment breach of a dangerous anomaly or anomalies occur, extra guards will be assigned to prevent access to SCP-1322-J-1. 
 Description: SCP-1322-J is a space-time anomaly two metres in height and one metre across located in Site-27's break room leading to a parallel universe designated as SCP-1322-J-1. SCP-1322-J appears to lead to an alternate Foundation's Site-27 break room. 
 SCP-1322-J-1 appears to be identical to baseline reality, except for its chiral nature. Due to this effect, it is currently impossible for personnel to enter SCP-1322-J-1, as their chiral counterparts will block them from entering. Attempts to collaborate with SCP-1322-J-1 instances will prove fruitless from what appears to be a result of its anomalous chiral nature, and meaningful communication will prove impossible. 
 SCP-1322-J was discovered by Researcher Cameron Barnes, who proceeded to immediately alert security to the presence of an unknown anomaly. Currently, Barnes is in charge of containment. 
 Test 1
Success: N
Action Taken: Researcher Barnes attempted to enter SCP-1322-J.
Result: Researcher Barnes collides with SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes. Barnes attempts to enter the anomaly for 23 minutes, but is blocked by SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes. Testing ends after SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes becomes aggressive. 
 Test 2
Success: N
Action Taken: MTF Eta-15 (""Chess Players"") is ordered to enter SCP-1322-J by any means necessary.
Result: MTF Eta-15 immediately entered hand to hand combat with their counterparts. As expected, neither version of MTF Eta-15 made any progress. Testing was abandoned after MTF Eta-15 deployed grenades, resulting in three members requiring hospitalization. 
 Test 3
Success: N
Action Taken: A drone is deployed towards SCP-1322-J.
Result: The drone is blocked by the alternate drone. 
 Test 4
Success: N
Action Taken: A drone (D-1) is taped on top of another drone (D-2) and sent towards SCP-1322-J at 60 km/h, in the hopes that the impact will throw D-1 into SCP-1322-J-1.
Result: D-1 is dislodged by D-2's impact and thrown towards SCP-1322-J-1, but is blocked by its counterpart that experienced a matching flight pattern. 
 Test 5
Success: Y
Action Taken: D-23432 is ordered to enter the portal on pain of immediate termination.
Result: D-23432 appeared confused about SCP-1322-J, insisting it was not anomalous. D-23432 refused to enter SCP-1322-J. 
 Item #: SCP-1322-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1322-J is to be removed from the break room and put in secure storage.

SCP-1333-J!,"""THE SCREAMING MAN""","""Item #: SCP-1333 
 Object Class: Enochian 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1333 is to be contained in the Third Volume of Gaspar's Revenants, a text which should manage to contain its awesome powers. SCP-1333's energies must be bled off through epic necromantic rituals, orchestrated by no fewer than seventeen dreadlords. Additional Foundation dreadlords are allowed, permitting that additional necromantic angstroms are recorded by the vociferon. 
 Description: SCP-1333 is THE SCREAMING MAN! His power is justifiably feared, as a consequence of his very presence ushering in the end times. Should THE SCREAMING MAN ever actually SCREAM!, then I fear for us all, for his breaths would shatter the very foundations of the universe. Consult a necromancer for further information. 
 Currently, should THE SCREAMING MAN'S powers ever be harnessed, he could be an unstoppable tool for super evil super good and not evil. 
 Claims that should anyone stare too long into his cavernous nostrils they will ""…see into the dark void that lies beyond the soul of man"" are currently unconfirmed, pending testing.

SCP-1344-J,"""Glass-Like Lifeform""","""Item #: SCP-1344-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: The sole contained specimen of SCP-1344-J shall be contained within a holding cell under constant video surveillance. Once a day, it is to be fed by leaving a live pig within its cell. In the event that SCP-1344-J escapes, staff is recommended to stay away from walls and doors to avoid harm in case SCP-1344-J decides to break through. 
 Description: SCP-1344-J is a carnivorous, apparently silicon-based living organism. The creature's translucent tissue appears similar to glass, but is quite elastic and highly resistant to damage. SCP-1344-J displays some similarities to the genus Nepenthes, as its whole body is essentially a globe-shaped sac, open at the top and filled with digestive fluids. Stubby limbs are attached to the sac. Sensory organs (two eyes, a nose) and a ""mouth"" (not used for eating, and serving solely for vocalization) are visible at the front of the creature, composed of a similar glass-like substance, but black in color. A torus-shaped structure at the back of the sac is theorized to act as the brain. 
 SCP-1344-J isn't directly aggressive most of the time, and hunts by attempting to coax victims to reach into its sac and drink some of its digestive fluid. As it is highly corrosive, the victims' innards will typically dissolve painfully within minutes after as little as 150 mL is drunk. SCP-1344-J then absorbs the dead remains with its skin. 
 When SCP-1344-J feels threatened, or wants to reach possible victims in the vicinity, its most remarkable ability manifests. It is capable of causing major structural damage by easily destroying most walls and other barriers, including those made of wood, stone, steel, [DATA EXPUNGED] and titanium. SCP-1344-J will simply run through the barrier in its way, typically causing a shower of destructive debris, dealing life-threatening or outright lethal wounds to those on the other side. SCP-1344-J is noted to vocalize a single, specific noise while destroying an obstacle in this way; while originally thought to be a ""battle-cry"" of sorts, it is now theorized that SCP-1344-J damages objects by generating vibrations of a specific frequency with its vocalization organ, causing a mechanical resonance within the obstacle.""",,+254,active,acoustic alive corrosive euclid glass humanoid joke liquid predatory scp vibration,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1344-j
SCP-1394-J,"""Upside-Down Connector""","""Item #: SCP-1394-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1394-J escaped containment in 1995, and all attempts to return it to containment have been unsuccessful.  Current containment efforts involve supplanting SCP-1394-J with a replacement standard (see Project Thunderbolt), which has met with limited success to date. 
 Description: SCP-1394-J is any instance of a rectangular connector adhering to the Universal Serial Bus (USB) Type A standard, such as found on typical wired computer keyboards and mice.  All known instances of SCP-1394-J demonstrate anomalous behavior when attempting to insert them into a corresponding USB Type A socket.  No matter how carefully the user studies the orientation of SCP-1394-J and socket, during the initial insertion attempt SCP-1394-J will invariably be found to be upside-down.  When the user flips SCP-1394-J over and attempts to re-insert it, it will again be found to be upside-down.  In no case can SCP-1394-J be correctly inserted prior to the third attempt, and an average of four attempts are required before SCP-1394-J is oriented correctly. 
 While this behavior does not directly harm users of SCP-1394-J, it requires users to spend additional time continually re-orienting SCP-1394-J in order to successfully connect it.  The lost productivity due to this wasted time has been calculated at █.██ billion USD.""","""SCP-1394-J prior to insertion.""",+194,active,_cc computer euclid joke metamorphic scp uncontained,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1394-j
SCP-1417-J,"""Passive-Aggressive Meteorite""","""Item #: SCP-1417-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: As it cannot be moved, a titanium containment chamber 10m x 10m x 10m has been erected around SCP-1417-J, with SCP-1417-J itself in the center. SCP-1417-J's containment chamber is to be painted solid white and decorated with prop scientific and medical equipment. At no point should any equipment installed within the containment chamber be used for actual examination of SCP-1417-J. Current authorized decorations include: 
 SCP-1417-J's containment chamber is to be staffed at all times by no less than three Level 1 personnel with prior experience in live theatre or public performance, and who have attended and passed Foundation Training Seminar 43021.102 (""Improvisational Acting and SCP Containment""), 52033.206 (""Advanced Technobabble""), and 83902.101 (""SCIENCE!""). Containment personnel are to be dressed in white laboratory coats and wear eyeglasses at all times, and are to carry a notepad, six pens or pencils and two test tubes in a breast pocket, a slide rule, and a pair of opaque goggles. Containment personnel are not to make any actual attempts at experimentation on or scientific observation of SCP-1417-J, and are to engage in ""experimentation"" involving the provided prop equipment while pretending to take notes and speaking to each other in ""technobabble"" with no intended actual meaning. Actual observation and monitoring of SCP-1417-J is to be conducted indirectly by hidden camera and microphone; in the event that physical interaction with SCP-1417-J is required for testing purposes, personnel conducting the examination are to be dressed and behave in a similar manner to containment personnel. 
 In the event that SCP-1417-J ceases to respond to standard containment, Emergency Procedure 1634-Broadway is to be conducted as soon as possible until such time as SCP-1417-J becomes inactive. Emergency Procedure 1634-Broadway is to be rewritten after each such implementation and containment personnel are to rehearse the current procedure for at least two hours each day while not engaged in containment. Class-B or Class-E amnestics are to be distributed to the civilian population of █████ as necessary in the event of high-visibility containment breaches. 
 Description: SCP-1417-J is an irregularly shaped meteorite approximately 1.2 kg in mass, composed primarily of silicates and igneous stone, which entered the Earth's atmosphere on ██/██/20██ and impacted the Earth's surface in a desert area approximately 6.3 km east of █████, Iraq. SCP-1417-J's surface has been no less than ███ degrees Centigrade in temperature at all times since its discovery; all attempts at relocating SCP-1417-J from its impact site have resulted in its temperature increasing rapidly and producing physical pain or destruction of equipment being used to attempt to move it. Physical analysis suggests that SCP-1417-J came into being during the initial formation of the Solar system approximately 4.3 billion years ago, and that it had been in an irregular orbit of the Earth for an unknown period of time prior to its impact. 
 SCP-1417-J is believed to be sentient and to possess telekinetic abilities. No means of direct communication with SCP-1417-J has been established; observation suggests that SCP-1417-J is able to see and hear events occurring within its immediate vicinity, that it is sensitive to radio waves, and that it is able to induce telekinetic effects within a 20 km radius of itself (an area including all of central █████ and several outlying suburbs and agricultural areas). 
 SCP-1417-J's telekinetic abilities become active whenever it is not undergoing what it considers to be active ""scientific observation"", which it appears to define as being directly observed by a group of human beings who are experimenting on it with electrical or chemical apparati and taking written notes regarding it. Early attempts at containing SCP-1417-J with legitimate scientific research became ineffective after approximately two weeks, whereafter increasingly dramatized and pseudoscientific ""Hollywood science"" setpieces were performed by containment personnel with success, leading eventually to the establishment of current containment protocols. Current speculation by Foundation xenopsychological specialists suggests that SCP-1417-J finds actual scientific research ""uninteresting"" or ""unrealistic"", and that stylized performances with no actual scientific merit are more ""entertaining"" to it or appealing to its ego. 
 In the event that direct observation as described above ceases or the quality of performance fails to ""impress"" SCP-1417-J, it will begin to employ its telekinetic abilities against site personnel and/or civilians in the neighboring areas. Manifestations of SCP-1417-J's telekinetic ability have been noted to extend solely to mischievous deeds of a light-hearted nature (""pranks"" or ""practical jokes"" in common use), beginning at a rate of approximately one per minute and increasing in frequency and severity until containment performance resumes, with a high of 700 instances per hour noted during Containment Breach 1417-J-36. ""Pranks"" performed by SCP-1417-J rarely result in direct lasting harm to the target; in advanced containment breaches, however, pranks have become increasingly malicious in nature and have been noted to result indirectly in serious injury or fatality. Pranks performed by SCP-1417-J have been documented as including; 
 Foreword: On ██/██/20██, a Level 1 employee engaged in routine containment procedures broke character after tripping and injuring himself. As a result of the lapse in containment, SCP-1417-J began instigating telekinetic pranks throughout the █████ area and failed to respond to attempts at re-containing it. Dr. James Anderson, current SCP-1417-J containment manager and six-time star of the annual Site-19 Christmas Pageant, entered the containment chamber to assist in conducting Emergency Procedure 1634-Broadway. Personnel on hand: Dr. Anderson, Dr. Sarah Becker, Dr. Ibrahim Kemal, Dr. Andrew Sullivan.

 Anderson: Mother of God. 
 Becker: If we don't stop the antipolar magnetic attractors from aligning in the next three minutes, Doctor, this entire continent is going to be kaput! We're going to have to reboot the central lenticular magnetron and… 
 Anderson: Dammit, there's no time! Ibrahim, you took Advanced Phlogistonics back in college, right? 
 Kemal: Yes, sir, but I don't see how that's…

 Anderson: If we don't stop those nega-quarks from sorting the strange matter from the osmium-freon colloid, we're all dead! Ibrahim: can you do it? 
 Kemal: I… I can't do it, sir. 
 (Anderson slaps Kemal across the face) 
 Anderson: Dammit, Ibrahim! When I rescued you from the orphanage in that Turkish prison, it was because I knew someday you'd save the entire world. Are you going to let me down now? 
 (Kemal sighs and mumbles under his breath in Arabic.) 
 Kemal: I… I can do it, sir. Stand back and watch how a pro does it. 
 (Kemal puts one hand on the plasma lamp and one on the Van de Graaff generator and begins to mime being electrocuted.) 
 Kemal: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

 Sullivan: Oh my God… 
 Becker: 87… 93… 99.8, sir… 
 Kemal: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

 Becker: 99.9… 92. 73. 48. It's going down, sir! 
 Sullivan: Raritanium levels dropping… negative Aetherius levels nominal… we're in the clear, sir! 
 Anderson: We did it! Ibrahim, are you OK? 
 (Kemal falls flat on his back.) 
 Anderson: Dammit! 
 (Anderson rushes to Kemal's side and begins miming CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.) 
 Anderson: Don't you die on me, you son of a bitch! You've never given up on anything before! Don't you give up on me now! 
 (Kemal coughs, lurches up, and rises slowly to his feet.) 
 Kemal: Did we do it? 
 Sullivan: We sure did… son. 
 Kemal: I knew we would… dad. 
 (Anderson sweeps Becker off her feet and kisses her.) 
 Anderson: I love you. 
 Becker: I'm pregnant. 
 Anderson: But how…? 
 Becker: SCIENCE! 
 (Kemal and Sullivan cheer as Anderson lifts Becker off her feet and carries her out of the containment chamber. Relief staff enter and standard containment resumes.)

 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: There is to be only one SCP-1459 per office, and five altogether to a level. The sponges can be stored individually, and passed around when needed, or in a cupboard which they are to be returned to when finished. Lost and destroyed sponges are to be sent back or written up and new ones received. Information concerning SCP-1459's structure, biological code, and how to grow them is to be classified, along with the location of any tanks serving as a habitat. These facilities are to be guarded and serviced by maintenance personnel. 
 Description: SCP-1459 is a species of sponge, found in the Mediterranean, known to the natives as the X Sponge, because of the large shape resembling a letter X on its front. This SCP was one of the first discovered by The Foundation, and played an integral part in formation of document appearance and the standardization on how reports are presented. 
 The X Sponge, when brushed over a sentence or a piece of writing, will absorb the text, sucking it off the page, and leave a blank spot. In the earlier days, these sponges were indispensable in censoring documents and getting rid of offending or dangerous information quickly. The personnel would remove the classified intelligence and then in its place write {DATA X-SPONGED} When the sponge was then wrung out afterwards, it would emit a thick black ichor, the words in liquid form. This substance could be used to ink out parts of the page by smearing it along the surface, leaving a blocked-out line. This too was incorporated into everyday secretarial work. After many years, however, the sponges ████████████████ (sorry, some got on the page, I'm looking at it as I write this report for inspiration) became scarce, and as our sites expanded, could not as readily be used by all. New methods were designed, or old normals ones put back into place, and ██ even the phrase mutated slowly into {DATA EXPUNGED} as many █ forgot ██ (it's dripping!) █ its origin.

 As SCP-1471-J manifests and downloads itself from an unknown source without displaying any notifications on the phone in question, complete tracking, identification, and containment of the application is not possible at this point. Affected personnel should regularly check their phone's list of currently running applications and close SCP-1471-J if it is active. Following safe deletion of the application, affected persons should search the installed application list on their mobile device at least thrice weekly in order to ensure the application has not been re-downloaded without their knowledge. 
 Given the known inaccuracy of the application's portrayal of Foundation employees, as well as the presence of material not suitable for a work environment, affected persons may request their names and related information be redacted in this document at their discretion. 
 Description: SCP-1471-J is an anomalously manifesting iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and GNU/Linux application file which, upon launch, will display the title ""Sensual Containment Procedures"" with the subtitle ""The Foundation's one and only dating and hookup app."" 
 SCP-1471-J has three functions:

SCP-1472-J,"""Scranton Realty Anchors""","""Item #: SCP-1472-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Each SCP-1472-J instance is to be either in use at one of SCR's properties or stored at any Foundation site with an adequate Safe-class containment area at any given time. During transportation, SCP-1472-J instances are to be secured in the back of the vehicle and covered with a protective opaque tarp. To deter civilian inquiries and tampering, the vehicle in question is to be flagged with standard transport warning 'corrosive' and 'radioactive' placards. 
 When installing an SCP-1472-J instance on-site on one of SCR's properties, the area is to be secured by no fewer than three qualified Foundation personnel equipped with the following: 
 Description: SCP-1472-J is any one of 35 instances of a large, primarily metallic device3 which, when activated, emits a faint red light, low levels of microwave and infrared radiation, and a Hume resistance field of anywhere from one to seven Humes. 
 SCP-1472-J instances are anomalous in that they do not require a constant power supply despite using an estimated 2,000 watts when powered on; they instead function reliably for several years at a time with no electrical input other than that of the initial input. Site-81 R&D personnel cite never having installed capacitors capable of this level of power conservation during prototype stages, and it is not understood how SCP-1472-J instances developed this function. Further research is ongoing.4 
 Currently there are 35 registered SCP-1472-J devices; two are derelict and no longer safe for field application, 27 are in use at SCR properties, and six are held in storage at Sites -81 and -12. SCR has 27 listed properties across the continental United States, all of which are former sites of anomalous activity purchased by the Foundation for research5. 
 SCP-1472-J instances are used on-site at properties listed by South Coast Realty for the purposes of continued protection from reality-affecting anomalous events, stabilization of the area6, and increase of property value.

 History: The first intentional SCP-1472-J prototype was developed in 2009 as a joint effort between Site-81 R&D and South Coast Realty7 in order to facilitate an organized, consistent, and safe manner of confirming property which was formerly anomalous can indeed be safely sold to the public Foundation personnel, retired Foundation personnel, or members of neutral or non-hostile Groups of Interest. 
 SCP-1472-J was originally planned for development as the Mark VIII iteration of the Foundation standard Scranton Reality Anchor, but through errors in development was found to be dysfunctional, with an upper containment limit of only seven Humes8 Thus, the blueprint and all related research was scrapped, and a new iteration of the Mark VIII standard SRA was developed. However, the failed prototype was then picked up by agents of South Coast Realty, who cited its large size and low Hume control capabilities as being ""perfect for that shitty-ass lot out in SCP-████'s area; god, I fucking hate that place, but if I can close it at 275 grand during this housing market crash, I'll win the monthly company competition, so I'll be damned.""9 Following this, Site-81 R&D oversight approved collaborative research efforts between themselves and Foundation front company South Coast Realty, and signed over all internal Foundation usage and development rights to SCR agents. Following this, SCP-1472-J instances were put into use with approval from all involved departments.

SCP-1543-J,"""The Sun Launcher""","""Item: SCP-1543 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Since SCP-1543-02 was built by The Foundation, it requires no special form of containment, except to keep it hidden from the public eye, due to its advanced technology and anomalous materials. To do this, invisibility fields and light reflectors will be attached, and radio-jamming signals will be employed. SCP-1543-01 is a sentimental keepsake, and is to be kept in a museum built around its original location. This museum is to be curated and cleaned by a top-notch maintenance crew, as SCP-1543-01 represents an important part of The Foundation's history and heritage. Also, because of this, all workers get a vacation at least once a year to visit, and level three and four receive free passes, along with cheaper access to the lecture hall. 
 Description: SCP-1543-01 is a catapult with an absurdly far length of range, designed in 16██ to meet a common need of that time: launching dangerous and potentially reality-altering objects into the sun. Apparently people thought back then that the easiest and most efficient way of disposing of SCPs was the burning heat of a star, even if the object in question could be destroyed in a simpler way, would escape while flying through the air, or would actually feed off the energy inside the thing that was supposed to annihilate it. Despite the fact that this was often an unnecessary waste of resources and time, it was often decided as the best course of action. 
 Inside the museum surrounding it, displayed behind glass cases and on pedestals, painted and photographed, and sold on key chains in miniature form, are replicas of all the SCPs launched into the Sun by SCP-1543-01. Some of these include: 
 SCP-1543-02 is a large spacecraft shaped like a cannon. All the money that could have gone into curing diseases or designing better sites went into its construction (it seems to be almost an obsession with the higher members). Because of this, it is surrounded by three fusion rings, and contains a fission core, fourteen on-board AIs, a full faculty, and the most precise aiming system ever made— controllers can pick the exact spot where the SCP that bounces off of colored objects is shot. Painted on the side is the motto, in large capital letters, ""When in doubt, launch into the sun"" (which some feel can never match the flair of the SCP's old creed, ""Into the fiery orb with ye""). Here is a partial list of objects launched into the sun by the station: 
 Addendum 01: I don't like the tone of this report! The sun launcher is freaking awesome, everyone knows real men like SCP-1543! I have a poster of it in my quarters! Yeah! 
 Addendum 02: Because of 682's continuing resistance to being shot into the sun, a new solution has been devised: building an even bigger sun launcher, specially designed for the lizard. Rumor has it that this one might either: A) launch the bastard straight through the sun, B) launch him really hard into the sun, or C) pull the sun towards the station (like on wicked fire chains or something). Because of the costs of this massive undertaking, the research department had to be shut down. Lets just say they weren't pleased and didn't go quietly; a couple left screaming something about having discovered a way to kill 682. What a bunch of losers. 
 Addendum 03: There is a long standing tradition of rivalry between the task force that runs The Sun Launcher and Team 10 Gazillion Nuclear Detonations All Used At Once. Both think their way is the best, and the other's is completely ridiculous. 
 Addendum 04: Team 10 Gazillion Nuclear Detonations All Used At Once has been complaining because of all the focus and attention given to the new sun launcher, as well as all the funds being directed to the project. As a compromise, this deal has been reached: an undisclosed number of nuclear missiles have been placed on the spacecraft, just in case anything goes wrong, and buttons to activate the self-destruct sequence have been placed in open accessible spaces, for easy and quick access. When The League of Needlessly Wasting Class D Personnel heard of this and complained, whining of favoritism, a shipment of prisoners was brought up to the shuttle, to be kept in a special area outside of the spacecraft. Another special interest group, The White Cane, tried to jump on the bandwagon and asked that these Class D Personnel be blind for better containment procedures. They were soothed when we told them that the vacuum of space would most likely cause the guards' eyes to pop out anyway. 
 Addendum 05: The Department of Arming Violent Criminals has successfully lobbied to have the D-Class security detail issued M249 light machine guns. Further requests for FMJ, explosive, or incendiary ammunition are under review due to the recent ""micrometeor shower"" that inflicted roughly $7 billion worth of damage on [REDACTED].""",,+606,active,euclid extraterrestrial foundation-made joke scp sun weapon,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1543-j
SCP-1550-J,"""The Professor's Wheelchair""","""Item: SCP-1550 
 Object Class: Euclid/Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1550 has caused several disasters already, by significantly altering humanoid SCPs' personalities and abilities which confuses new researchers, messes with records, and poses a very real physical danger. Because of this, all research on 1550 has been halted, and it is kept in a small storage locker, triple-locked, under express orders not to be removed. 
 Description: 1550 is a stylish metal wheelchair, with electronics in both armrests. It is motorized and can reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. On a molecular and tangible level it is completely normal; however, when a humanoid SCP sits in on the seat, six things will happen instantaneously: 
 1550-1 will begin wheeling around whatever site they are contained in, speaking with scientists and workers. As they pass by rooms of humanoid SCPs they will engage them in conversation, and certain alterations to reality will begin to manifest. This does not require contact; if 1550-1 remains in the chair for a long enough time, The X-Men Syndrome, as it is called, will spread in a radius further and further out. Certain similarities can be observed every time: 
 The changes in reality begin first around the person sitting in 1550 and SCPs in their cells, each one a small pocket of reality that contradicts the rest of the world. But soon, the entire dynamic of The Foundation begins to change. After a week, SCPs will be free to leave their rooms, and wander around, and most requests are granted. Reports will consist of nothing but lists on their likes and dislikes, and inventories of all the cool music and movies they own. Research will be halted because it is inhumane. Class designations will not be how dangerous or hard to contain they are, but simple power levels, with Keter class bragging about their potential and how much better they are than everyone else. These will often be replaced with simple numbers, or categories that indicate how far along they are on the ""evolutionary scale"". Soon, in no less then a month, SCPs will be on every task force, and all major operations will consist of them. Often they will create their own team, and attempt to be ""superheroes"". They will begin dressing in leather jackets and pants, although some do prefer older more retro uniforms like capes and tights, and inordinate amounts of money will begin draining from The Foundation in order to build special bases, homes and school grounds, equipment, and virtual reality simulation facilities. The Professor will begin training them in karate and the martial arts, although this will also begin happening spontaneously, in the confines of their own room (they will all of a sudden for no discernible reason begin kicking and flying through the air) if 1550-1 does not meet them in time. (Iris became a black belt in one day.) Beast and artifact SCPs will fade away, and become all but forgotten. It is often at this time that some backlash is noted; whether this is rational or part of 1550's effect is unknown. Scientists will slowly begin trying to sabotage and rein in the team, or use them towards their own nefarious ends. SCPs will often discover The Foundational is still experimenting on someone, and be shocked and dismayed, causing more conflict and friction. In the end, several large scale termination attempts are approved. In addition to these fairly logical responses, several irrational ones appear as well. Scientists will lose their sanity, and attempt to take over the world using the task forces. Overseers will order the building of giant robots. Well meaning level four personnel start working on a ""cure"", even though it should be patently impossible. 
 It is unknown what happens if it would be allowed to progress beyond this, point but it is theorized that it would result in the complete destruction of The Foundation, and the eventual victorious emergence of some kind of benevolent ""mutant"" organization, with SCPs as agents and staff, traveling around the world, fighting crime in a stealth jet. 
 Addendum 01: 
 During a Chaos Insurgency attack on Sector ██, 076's legs were blown off during helping repulse the assault. An agent pulled the SCP and managed to sit him down in a wheelchair that had been pulled out of the closet, so Able could continue fighting. ""I expected him to start throwing swords from a seated position, or attach rotating saws to the wheels and start zooming around on them."" Instead as soon as Able touched the seat of 1550, he said, softly ""They're attacking because of intolerance"" and then took a rocket to the head. Later tests confirmed the anomalous properties, although Able is unique in the fact that despite the pacifistic mind that is created, he still will attempt to maliciously kick and trip people by grabbing a hold of his pants leg and swinging the disabled limbs at them. 
 Addendum 02: 
 Log 1550-13 
 (Three scientists are walking down the hallways with Able on 1550. They briefly meet up with 2 scientists talking to a young girl, who was about to be categorized as SCP-███.) 
 Scientist: So welcome to Site 17- 
 Able: the school for gifted youngsters. 
 Scientist 2: What? 
 Girl: Why do I have to be here? Oh, why am I cursed with this- 
 Able: You must not think of it that way. With great power comes great responsibility. In time you will learn to control- 
 Girl: But my power is that my imaginary friends and whatever else I fantasize about comes alive and turns evil and tortures me in my mind. How is that- 
 Able: (continues) You will find here the finest facilities at your service. You are free to go wherever you like and— 
 Scientist 2 and 3: (they just shake their head whenever the girl looks at them) 
 Able: —and soon in time, you will meet others of your kind. This is a safe haven for mutants, where you will not be persecuted. 
 Scientist 1: (sighs) 
 Guard 3: (puts palm to head) 
 Able: My name is Professor A, and -

 132: I feel the world's sorrow! 
 Girl: Wow, she's cool! 
 Able: Yes. Her name is Sorrow. She is one of the select few.. An A-man. 
 Scientist: What…the…fuck… 
 Able: Ah, and here are the quarters of 415. He's a lovable rogue. 
 415: Hey, I told you I don't like doctors. Get away from me. (three medical assistants are attempting to look him over) 
 415: Back off, bub. 
 Doctor: Now, 415… 
 415: It's Steve. OK. Either Steve or my codename. OK? Got it? Hey. Seriously. Don't come near me! You know I'm going to stab you with one of my claws. 
 Doctor: What in God's name are you talking about? 
 415: Well look at all these modifications. You don't think they'd give me claws or something? 
 Doctor: But why? They were harvesting your organs. What purpose would it serve- ah! He really does have claws! 
 Doctor: Jesus, when did he get those?! 
 Able: We have quite a motley crew here. But we all love each other like family. (a young Asian girl jumps down from a balcony overhead, and slowly lifts out of a crouch. she is wearing a leather jacket and motorcycle boots) 
 Scientist: 231! 
 Able: You mean Marvel Woman? 
 Girl: What's her power, mister? 
 231: Well, I can [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Scientist 2: (mouth wide open, shocked expression on his face) 
 231: I also like shopping. 
 (This is a transcript of a conversation between Able and Iris, when someone else besides 076 was sitting in the chair) 
 Iris: Hey! Stay away from Alice, Computra, OK? 
 Able: You're not the boss of me, Triclops! (he is referring to Iris as Triclops because of a mechanical device strapped on top of her head) 
 Iris: She's my girlfriend. Stop trying to butt in- 
 Able: Shut your face! 
 Iris: You think you can say whatever you want just because you have stubble and sideburns? 
 Able: Mutton chops! 
 Mediating researcher: I don't want to interrupt, but Able, aren't you incapable of feeling love? 
 Able: No… I just have a dark past. 
 Researcher: Huh? 
 Able: I'm generally good at heart. I've had a tough life, though. 
 Researcher: I've seen you stab a kid in the face! 
 Able: No. I only fight against those who seek to harm me. 
 Researcher: You've devastated an entire base with one sword before! 
 Able: Must have been under mind control, bub. Used to be in a super soldier program, after all. *chews on cigar*""",,+170,active,able artifact joke keter metallic mind-affecting scp telekinetic,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1550-j

SCP-1595-J,"""Sweethearts""","""Item #: SCP-1595-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2 are to be kept in separate standard humanoid containment cells under constant surveillance. Personnel monitoring them must have an ample supply of insulin and a syringe on their person at all times. Additionally, these personnel are advised against eating shortly before and after their shifts. Under no circumstances may SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2 be within eyesight of each other, as a mere wayward glance has been proven lethal. Personnel handling SCP-1595-J must wear ear protection to avoid fatal auditory exposure. 
 SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2 are permitted to send each other messages, designated SCP-1595-3. However, personnel are to avoid looking at SCP-1595-3 and their contents. SCP-1595-3 will be delivered by hand in envelopes marked [REDACTED] for SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2 to read, followed by SCP-1595-3's incineration, as the sight of large quantities of SCP-1595-3 is hazardous. 
 In the event of a containment breach by SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2, a recovery team must be sent equipped with [REDACTED] to avoid lethal visual exposure, as SCP-1595-J will most likely be engaging in romantic or sexual activities. 
 Description: SCP-1595-J is a young couple named R████ and J█████, respectively designated as SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2. Both appear to be Caucasian and in their mid-██s. SCP-1595-1 and SCP-1595-2 are constantly infatuated with each other. Because of this as well as the fact that auditory exposure to both of them together is lethal, Dr. ████ theorized that all they ever talk about is how much they love each other. They are able to draw the loosest associations between anything and their relationship. When together, they are in a constant state of kissing, cuddling, hand-holding, skipping, spinning, hugging, giggling, flirting, dancing, or coitus, sometimes all at once. 
 Observing SCP-1595-J's public displays of affection triggers a near-spontaneous neurochemical and hormonal imbalance in the observer. Witnessing the pair expressing their feelings for each other leads to a dramatic increase in flow of dopamine throughout the nervous system as well as a sudden total loss of insulin in the bloodstream, resulting in euphoria, cognitive failure, and eventually a comatose state or expiration from severe hyperglycemia. 
 Discovery: SCP-1595-J was found slow-dancing to their favorite song, ████, in the middle of Club █████████ at approximately 2200 hours, ██/██/████ in ██████████, Arizona. They were surrounded by an estimated [REDACTED] dead clubbers who had witnessed the couple's outward affection for each other. The Foundation was notified immediately after local law enforcement discovered the club full of deceased save for the lone couple who were still dancing. 
 Interview #██ 
 [overhead light heard flickering]
Dr. █████: How are you feeling today?
SCP-1595-1: Dead inside without my J█████. My heart beats for her like the flicker of that light! It's like the mosquito of passion that buzzes in my ear!
Dr. █████: Kill the lights.
[light switch heard clicking]
SCP-1595-1: How dark the world seems without her now, as though I can see the glow of our hearts no longer.
[Interview ended by Dr. █████, as his blood sugar level had started to spike along with his irritability] 
 Interview #██ 
 Dr. █████: Where did you come from?
SCP-1595-2: [crying] It's been so long since I've heard from him.
Dr. █████: When did you last receive a letter?
SCP-1595-2: [sob] Two hours ago. He said my kiss was sweeter than agave syrup—
Dr. █████: Oh, no.
SCP-1595-2: and that he'll always be there for me, and that I'm cute, but I told him he's cuter.
[armed personnel fire two tranquillizer darts]
Note: At this point, Dr. █████ was beginning to show signs of sudden severe hyperglycemia, including fatigue, headaches, and blurred vision. 30 units of insulin administered. 
 Interview #██ 
 SCP-1595-1: Do you believe in true love, doctor? It's like life's opera—
Dr. █████: What's the first thing you remember?
SCP-1595-1: The most beautiful face in the world. I had not lived before I beheld such hotness.
Dr. █████: We need to try something else.
SCP-1595-1: The moment we locked eyes (such deep, rich jewels, those eyes), our destinies revealed themselves to us.
Dr. █████: [unintelligible] … word choice.
SCP-1595-1: Only the cosmic jaws of life could break the link between us.
[SCP-1595-1 heard being taken back to its cell while emergency medical assistance is provided to Dr. █████.] He was later diagnosed with Type-█ diabetes, requiring dialysis. 
 Interview #██: 
 Dr. █████: J█████, please remove your finger from your nose.
SCP-1595-2: We used to pick each other's noses.
Dr. █████: That's disgusting.
SCP-1595-2: Then we'd wash our hands together, letting our sudsy fingers entwine under the cool running water. Reminds me of the time we floated by a waterfall holding hands like little otters.
Dr. █████: Help! 
 Note: Dr. █████ has concluded that the visualization of SCP-1595-J's public displays of affection initiates the anomalous effect to a lesser but still significant extent than from observing it firsthand. Requests for additional interviews have been denied, and they will continue to be denied as the interviewer will expire if he has to hear SCP-1595-J talk about each other one more goddamn time. He only has one foot now.""",,+53,active,alive auditory cognitohazard euclid humanoid joke sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1595-j
SCP-1622-J,"""No Object Class Whatsoever""","""Item #: SCP-1622 
 Object Class: Malkuth (Simple/Low) Gevurah (Dangerous/High) Pending 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1622 is to be contained in a standard biological containment unit located in Site-77. Personnel observing SCP-1622 are to note its rate of consumption and any other notable or unusual behavior. 
 Description: SCP-1622 is a specimen of Citrus × sinensis (sweet orange), originating from Lakeland, FL. It is a navel orange, with a small protrusion at one of its ends. SCP-1622 appears to continuously consume its own body through its non-navel apex, while the other end produces new matter. It will consume itself in small, irregular amounts, and not in a continuous motion. 
 Addendum-01: File 1622-01 — Staff Comments 
 Malkuth? What is a Malkuth? That isn't an object class used by the Foundation. This is clearly a Safe class object, so I recommend you either use that or remove this unfinished document before the filing system implodes. Drop the (Simple/Low) bit, too. I don't even know what that's supposed to mean. You've clearly put minimal amount of work into this document, and I expect more from this team. — Director Gillespie 
 ""Malkuth"" is shorthand indicating a Simple/Low class object. ""Simple"" refers to the containment difficulty. ""Low"" refers to the threat level. The document is complete as-is. —Researcher Milton 
 Again, that's not an object classification system being used by the Foundation. What exactly do you hope to accomplish by adding an incomplete and incomprehensible document to our database? — Director Gillespie 
 I have submitted a report on the possible use of an alternate object class system to the desk of my head researcher. After receiving no response, I have resubmitted this report with minimal changes. I have done so on six occasions, from 1999-1-8 to 1999-8-9. I have interpreted the continued non-involvement as implicit permission to begin implementing this system. —Researcher Milton 
 For the record, the reason I failed to respond to his requests was that I didn't feel it was worth responding to. It's not really something you would take seriously, because this thing is ridiculous. Malkuth is a made-up word, and the extra bits at the end aren't comprehensible. 
 If you check your records, I had recommended that he be psychologically evaluated after the third submission, a request which I do not believe was followed up on, as of this date. — Researcher Hutchins 
 This documentation is much clearer than our current system, and I already have prepared briefings for the research team. We should be able to bring everyone up to date in a few days. — Researcher Milton 
 Addendum-02: Incident 1622-A 
 On ██/██/2███, Researcher Franklin accidentally introduced foreign matter to SCP-1622's cavity in the form of a wooden pencil, resulting in the mass being added to SCP-1622's repeated cycle, which warrants additional containment procedures and amendments to the SCP-1622 containment doctrine. This request is submitted for approval. 
 File 1622-05 — Staff Comments 
 This would never have happened if you hadn't been keeping this document up in the air, Milton. You need to remove it immediately from our system, or you are being removed from this project. As it is, we have a lot to add to containment because of this. — Researcher Hutchins 
 Staff hadn't been given the updates yet. I've distributed them to everybody, we should be fine now. — Researcher Milton 
 That's not an acceptable response, this needs to be removed and updated immediately. You'd made that before we had this incident, does it deal with new containment? You're just pushing your own screwed-up and incredibly terse document for… what? What do you actually hope to accomplish here, besides being removed from this position? — Researcher Hutchins 
 Addendum-03: Incident 1622-B 
 Due to the lack of additional funding or clearance to amend the containment doctrine, several researchers attempted to forcefully extract the foreign matter from SCP-1622. This caused injuries to two of the researchers, with one set of injuries being serious enough to warrant medical leave, and minor damage to the containment area. Disciplinary action is currently under consideration. 
 File 1622-09 — Staff Comments 
 You see? It wasn't enough, and now there's more damage to the containment area! What's going to be enough to prove that your little containment pipe dream needs to be kept in your head and out of the computers? — Researcher Hutchins 
 The reason there was an incident was because the team was using the old containment protocols you distributed on the new system. I'm confident that in time, we will be able to bring everyone to the same page. — Researcher Milton 
 Addendum-04: Incident 1622-C 
 On ██/██/2███, Researcher Hutchins attempted to forcefully enter the SCP-1622 research area, and was subdued by security personnel. Proper forms for disciplinary action have been forwarded to the director by project lead Researcher Milton. It is believed that Hutchins was attempting to alter the containment doctrines regarding SCP-1622, which Researcher Milton had already explained to be sufficient. 
 File 1622-13 — Staff Comments 
 What is this? I thought you took care of this, Hutchins. Why has nobody been using the normal protocols for discipline? This would've been solved ages ago, if you'd just come to me instead of getting in a pissing contest. Christ, both of you, you're better than this, this is beneath you. I need this to be immediately resolved, before anything else happens. — Director Gillespie 
 I'm sorry Director, but the situation is now under control. Everyone on staff has been given updates to the containment protocols, so there should be no more problems. Again, my apologies, this will not happen again. — Researcher Milton 
 Addendum-05: Incident 1622-E 
 On ██/██/2███, when the research team enacted a second attempt to remove the foreign matter from SCP-1622 resulted in SCP-1622 manifesting additional anomalous effects. It began to add large portions of the containment area and research staff to its cycle, and directly causing the breaching of ██ separately contained E-Class objects and 4 SCP objects. Security teams were able to contain the event, but SCP-1622 requires massive update to containment. Upgrade to Keter Gevurah(Dangerous/High) is currently pending. 
 File 1622-22 Staff Comment 
 Apparently not all my staff had received the necessary documentation. This will be rectified as soon as I update things. — Researcher Milton 
 Addendum-06: File 1622-31 — Status Report 
 Researchers Milton and Hutchins have been placed on indefinite leave, pending severe disciplinary action. Committees have been formed to study the issues these incidents present to the current structure of Site-77's chain of command, research database, containment areas, and the psychological status of prominent researchers. Containment doctrines of SCP-1622 have been slated for complete revision.

SCP-1638-J,"""A Dark and Mysterious Printing Plate""","""Item #: SCP-1638-J 
 Object Class: Better safe than sorry 
 Special Containment Procedures: Containment of SCP-1638-J is cut and dried: it is to be kept in low security locker 36 in site 21. SCP-1638-J wouldn't hurt a fly. 
 Description: Let's not beat around the bush, SCP-1638-J is a lead printing plate with dimensions of 21 cm by 30 cm, it is as black as coal. In a nutshell the majority of the content on the plate appears to be an advertisement written in English for four separate novels, but the jury is still out on this. In order to help set the record straight, the English content present on SCP-1638-J is displayed below: 
 Ace in the Hole 
 Jerry is an aging golfer, yet to win a major tournament. Geoff is a senior policeman, a week from retirement. When a prominent member of the Pleasant Springs Golf Club is murdered, Geoff is brought in to investigate. Jerry offers to help Geoff with the case, on the condition that they team up to compete in the annual Partners Golf Tournament. Geoff, a notorious lone wolf, reluctantly accepts the offer. Can this unlikely pair put aside their differences and work together? 
 The Big Apple 
 Sarah is a big city girl eager for a change. She leaves her high paying job and moves to the country in search of a new life working on an orchard. Sarah has a hard time fitting into rural life, but everything changes when she meets Jim. Jim, an experienced farmhand, takes Sarah under his wing. When Sarah's former employer offers her a new position she is forced to make a choice; does she move back to the city or stay on the orchard with Jim? 
 Out of the Frying Pan 
 When Edward Blanc suddenly develops amnesia, his company Blanc's Pans is in hot water. Only two people know the secret method used to make Blanc's world famous pans; with Edward unable to remember, time is running out for the company. Only Edward's former partner Juan Estavo can save them now. Unfortunately, Juan is in jail doing time for a crime he didn't commit. Can Joseph Geldbaum, a young lawyer with unorthodox methods, free Juan and stop Blanc's Pans from going bankrupt? 
 Jack of all Trades 
 Jack is a young man from a small farming village. When his village is destroyed by goblins he is forced to flee, ending up in the capital of a great empire. Jack works as a cook in the castle kitchens, until one day his fortunes change. Jack manages to save Princess Anna from an assassin and is offered a knighthood in return. When Princess Anna is captured by a dragon, Jack and his friend Albert, the wisecracking court jester, set off to slay the dragon and save the Princess. 
 Additional text is present on SCP-1638-J but it's all Greek to me. 
 SCP-1638-J is not dated and its country of origin is unknown. SCP-1638-J was recovered on ██-██-████, a dark and stormy night, from a printing house in Vienna. 
 Anyone writing about SCP-1638-J will tend to use more clichéd phrases than you can shake a stick at. This effect is unintentional and subjects are unaware of any alterations to their writing style. As for why SCP-1638-J has this effect, God only knows. 
 Last but not least, the novels alluded to by SCP-1638-J have not been located as of ██-██-████. As no progress has been made, the Foundation have thrown in the towel and ceased all searching for the novels. 
 That's the way the cookie crumbles. 
 Notes: 
 When it comes to SCP-1638-J what you see is what you get, it's not rocket science. Our resources are stretched thin at the moment and when push comes to shove there is no need for further experimentation on SCP-1638-J currently. Dr. █████████

SCP-1797-J,"""""GEORGE WASHINGTON ENTERTAINING A GENTLEMAN FRIEND WHILE PICKING HIS NOSE""""","""Item #: SCP-1797-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1797-J is to be kept inside a secure storage unit at the media archive of Site-77. It is to be checked regularly for imperfections. Once every four years, a search of any possibly related artifacts should be conducted through the archives. 
 Description: SCP-1797-J is a polymorphic oil portrait of former United States President George Washington. Behind him stands an unidentified male figure engaging in apparently vigorous sexual intercourse with Washington. 
 ""GEORGE WASHINGTON ENTERTAINING A GENTLEMAN FRIEND WHILE PICKING HIS NOSE""(sic) has been written on the backing with a felt tipped writing instrument. Laboratory analysis indicates that SCP-1797-J is from an authentic time period. 
 SCP-1797-J was initially encountered by a filing clerk in the George Washington Presidential Library in 1█81. Upon viewing it they alerted the local constabulary with the intent to find the painter and press ""obscenity charges"". A low-level investigation was conducted, at which point the Foundation was alerted and secured SCP-1797-J. 
 Further investigation of the library's records by Foundation personnel failed to yield any leads on SCP-1797-J's origin. 
 Repeated viewings of SCP-1797-J causes it to display a different scene. Each viewing becomes more and more ""randy""; However the President will always be picking his nose.

SCP-1830-J,"""Opening Line""","""Item #: SCP-1830-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Containment of SCP-1830-J is easier said than done, as our current abilities just don't cut the mustard. It goes without saying that the Foundation must search high and low for any documents affected by SCP-1830-J and end them once and for all, or it's only a matter of time before it's curtains for us. 
 All persons affected by SCP-1830-J must be terminated with extreme prejudice, time being of the essence. This is a tried and true method of putting a stop to it. The Foundation previously took a stab at amnestic administration in earlier days, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Staff interacting with SCP-1830-J victims should wear hearing protection, as an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
 Description: For all intents and purposes, SCP-1830-J is an anomaly affecting individuals which causes them to use over-the-top, clichéd turns of phrase in written documents, as well as perceiving other documents to be under the thumb of SCP-1830-J. In this day and age, it is estimated that ██% of the world's population is affected by SCP-1830-J (more or less), but these could be just the tip of the iceberg. 
 SCP-1830-J is able to spread like wildfire and should be avoided like the plague. Attempting to convince victims they are affected by SCP-1830-J is like talking to a brick wall, as they believe SCP-1830-J is the best thing since sliced bread. Administering standard intelligence tests suggests they are a few sandwiches short of a picnic. Communication with victims also runs the risk of spreading SCP-1830-J, as when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. 
 To the best of our knowledge, the origin of SCP-1830-J was mid-19th century England, where the turn of phrase ""██ ███ █ ████ ███ ██████ █████"" may be where it all began, although that could be just a shot in the dark. 
 If SCP-1830-J is allowed to run rampant, it's plain as day that this would cause literature as an art form to bite the dust; while there's no accounting for taste, works affected by SCP-1830-J are a far cry from readable. While the Foundation must count its blessings that no mass outbreak of SCP-1830-J has occurred, this may just be the calm before the storm. 
 Addendum: It looks like we've had the wool pulled over our eyes; SCP-1830-J was right under our noses the whole time. I propose we lock this article once and for all, so it won't cause anyone else to trip up. All's well that ends well! 
 It's a good thing the rest of the database is safe as houses.

SCP-1840-J,"""The Hard Sell""","""Item #: SCP-1840-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1840-J is not currently contained. Any telephone calls directed to the Foundation by SCP-1840-J should be re-routed immediately to Researcher Seaward. Under no circumstances should unauthorized personnel in contact with SCP-1840-J agree to purchase, rent, lease, borrow or take any item, object or being offered by the SCP-1840-J entity or through associated third parties. If any Foundation personnel are already in possession of an object or being obtained through SCP-1840-J, they are under strict instruction to promptly turn in the object or being, with full amnesty being granted if the SCP-1840-J customer can demonstrably prove that the purchase was made before the Foundation was aware of SCP-1840-J hazardous properties. 
 Description: SCP-1840-J exhibits traits of what is commonly referred to as a telemarketer. SCP-1840-J will periodically approach Foundation personnel in any capacity over a telephone and offer a brief and often exaggerated description of a item in its possession, followed by a negotiable price and means of payment, which is usually, although not always, SCP-1840-J supplying a location where the purchased item may be found, instructing the customer to leave the agreed amount of money in that location. SCP-1840-J has always honored its agreement with the customer. SCP-1840-J's voice is similar to that of a young male with a cheerful and arrogant temperament. 
 Items offered by SCP-1840-J are occasionally of simple monetary or curiosity value, such as fossilized dinosaur remains or diamond rings, but are more often anomalous artifacts of potency that ranges from Safe to highly dangerous Euclid-level artifacts. Researcher Seaward is under orders to purchase any item of sufficient threat for immediate containment. Despite the potentially huge monetary value of items sold by SCP-1840-J, the prices it opens with are usually extremely conservative, with a case of a Euclid-level artifact being bought for less than £5,000. SCP-1840-J displays a willingness to negotiate prices, and has been observed to accept less than 30% of the starting value. It will also occasionally offer items for free if a customer has proven sufficiently entertaining to it.

 Dr. Richter: —sorry, I must take this. Ah, hello? 
 SCP-1840-J: Hi there! Dr. Richter? Just the man. I have quite the offer for you today. Listen to this—how would you like to own a real-life fossilised dinosaur bone? Genuine article. Barely used! 
 Dr. Richter: What? Who is this? How—wait. In what sense is a dinosaur bone ‘barely used’? 
 SCP-1840-J: Well, y’see, this fossilised tibia is a big 65 million years old, and it’s only been inside a dinosaur for a tiny, tiny fraction of that time. It’s practically fresh!

Dr. Richter: Who are you? How did you get my number? 
 SCP-1840-J: Alright, I admit it. Previous owner wasn’t careful. Got blown up by an asteroid. Nice burn marks though. Oh, c’mon! I’m only asking for a fair go. I know archaeologists who’d sell their own tibia bone for a chance at this beauty. It’s a Tyrannosaur bone. King of the Jungle! Or the primordial swamp, really. 
 Dr. Richter: I don’t— 
 SCP-1840-J: Yeah, we’ll call it a round one thousand. And that is a low, low price because I’m feeling so generous today. You’ll be doing me a favour, friend, what with my dog filing for divorce and my wife at the vet. I mean—oh, whatever. I was lying. Alright, we'll call it eight hundred and that’s a scandal, it really is. 
 Dr. Richter: Is this some sort of prank? Researcher Daley! Trace this call immediately! What is your name, sir? I am a senior researcher at this facility, and I will not stand for juvenile— 
 SCP-1840-J: Oh, twist my arm! Five. Five hundred. Final offer. We’re talking a genuine fossilized Tyrannosaur bone here. Once in a lifetime stuff. You really can’t put a price on the pride of owning the remains of a vicious super-predator. Well, I did it anyway and it’s a round four hundred. Last chance. 
 Dr. Richter: I have no intention of buying anything, and when I find out who is the perpetrator of this childish prank, you will be extremely sorry! Good day to you!

 SCP-1840-J: Hey there, miss! Now, I have quite the little gem for a sweet young lady like yourself. Alright, consider this—for the price of a mere thousand pounds, you, little lady, could be the owner of the gift of beauty. Ultra rare. Especially around these parts. 
 Researcher Davis: Oh—Christ. Is this one of those confidence boost things? Like you direct me to a mirror or something and there’s a message saying ‘Ta-Da! You’re already beautiful!’ or something? Because that’s just— 
 SCP-1840-J: Actually it’s more of an injected nanotechnological genetic resequencer, but I could set up that mirror thing too if you like. I could set up all kinds of motivational messages if you want. ‘We Know What We’re Doing, Honestly’, that would be good for Foundation employees. ‘How Can Lead Researchers Sleep at Nights? They Don’t.’ Hey, I’m good at this. I can print. We’ll call it fifty for a pack of a hundred messages. Hey, and you’ll feel good without a risk of nanobots consuming your face. Forget I said that. 
 Researcher Davis: Hey, whoever you are, this isn’t funny. It really isn’t. I can’t help being— 
 SCP-1840-J: Yeah, you’re right. You people have no idea what you’re doing, do you? And sleep-deprivation-related mania probably isn’t funny either. Alright, scrap that. This resequencer thing’s still on offer though. The girlfriend used it. Completely unrecognisable. In a good way. Gorgeous eyes. Amazing hair. Great body. She could have any man she wanted. Probably why she left me. Seriously, you’ll kick yourself forever if you turn this down. What do you say? 
 Researcher Davis: [sarcastically] Oh sure. Can you send me a free sample? 
 SCP-1840-J: No can do, I’m afraid. It’s all sealed together in a magnetic storage core to stop the nanobots…look, the nanobots can get pretty vicious. They’ll resequence anything’s genes. They got to my dog once. Spliced it with a millipede. Vision of hell. Fast, though, and sticks to walls, so I suppose that’s something. Anyway, It’s all or nothing. Okay, seven hundred. C’mon, you believe me right? You work for the Foundation. You know this universe has the pants of insanity firmly on its head. Gene-resequencing nanobots are practically normal. Six hundred pounds for a lifetime of beauty. Waddaya say? 
 Researcher Davis: [sarcastically] Yeah, yeah. Leave it in the park at midnight and I’ll collect it. Hoot like an owl or something.

SCP-1840-J: Perfect! Excellent. I knew you were a girl with taste. Can’t thank you enough. Damn Harlequin’s breathing down my neck. We’ll keep it covert. Dead drop. I’ll leave the containment core under the green bridge in the park two blocks away. And get it quickly, the nanobots are restless recently. Cannibalized my phone and spliced it with my neighbour’s weasel. Unusual, but still highly functional. 
 Researcher Davis: Jesus Christ, you sound completely serious. You think I’m going to go to the park and grub around under a bridge for your ‘containment core’? You think I want to get spliced with a fly? 
 SCP-1840-J: They recognise human tissue. You’ll be fine. Completely fine! I’m serious about getting this core though. These nanobots are sadistic bastards. They’ll splice anything together. Swans, squirrels, and children nearby. Dread to think. Anyway, pleasure doing business with you! 
 [CALL ENDS] 
 Researcher Davis has been commended for her prompt containment of the item now dubbed SCP-████ and not using it for her own purposes. However, several nanobots escaped, leading to the creation of several cases of SCP-███ 
 SCP-1840-J claims to be an extremely wealthy human in possession of a large collection of anomalous artifacts. It frequently alludes to being pursued by a being it identifies as an ‘Unbound Harlequin’, forcing him to sell the collection in the hope of being harder to trace. 
 The known and recorded interactions of SCP-1840 with the Foundation began with two telephone calls, accumulating in a five-part interview with Ex-Researcher Richter, after which all interactions were recorded but have grown increasingly sporadic after Incident 1840-A 
 SUBJECT: SCP-1840
INTERVIEWER: Dr. Richter
TIME/DATE: 13:08 20/09/████ 
 SCP-1840-J: Hey—HEY, Doc! You’re looking good today, very, very, red-faced and angry. Outstanding. You’re going to love what I’ve got for you today. 
 Dr. Richter: Shut it, you bastard. You’ve been harassing me for months now! Quit the games! How did you learn of this organisation and facility? How did you learn about me? You may as well give it up and tell me. Our resources are vast. We will find you! 
 SCP-1840-J: That’s adorable, Doc. Okay, okay—let me start with a question. How’s the wife? 
 Dr. Richter: She’s dead. 
 SCP-1840-J: That’s fantastic. Out on the prowl again, eh, Doc? Rawr! Watch out ladies! But let’s talk business. I have something that will make you completely irresistible. You’ll love this. Guess how insects tell each other they’re in the mood? Pheromones! They can hardly help themselves when that stuff gets in the air! Amazing! Except humans don’t communicate through pheromones. Whatever. Doesn’t matter. Someone went ahead and invented the human romance pheromone anyway, and it’s as potent as hell. Beats cologne any day. I’m just throwing this out there, Doc, as you are—how can I put this delicately?—really, really fat. You’ll need it. I’ve got my entire stock up for sale. About one litre. You’ll be partying with a hundred sensuous beauties before you know it. And for you, my favourite customer? A mere six thousand. 
 Dr. Richter: I am saying this one last time: I will not purchase anything from you at any time, and I would ask you to never contact me again! Now! This is an interview, and I demand answers! Question one: How many, if any, Foundation personnel have purchased items through you, and if so, what are their names and what did they purchase? 
 SCP-1840-J: Oh, I’ve sold about…four items. Yes. Four. First one was to a delightful young lady. Purchased a nanotechnological genetic resequencer. Fantastic sale. One of my favourites. I got rid of that damn thing, and I think you managed to hunt down all the genetic hybrids before they did too much damage. Excellent job. I did warn her about the importance of containing the nanobots properly, but the swan people threw the Harlequin off my tracks for a while, so actually everything turned out fine. 
 Dr. Richter: You…you mean the cases of SCP-████? We had to shoot them down! They all died! Were you responsible? Answer me! 
 SCP-1840-J: Yeah, It was probably less fine from where they were sitting. Whatever. Okay, so you don’t want the pheromones? Too bad. How about this then: This very special tabloid newspaper. Plenty of pictures. Except it doesn’t show celebrities doing real things, it shows the stuff you wish they did. Secret homosexual affairs. Satan worship. Punch-ups. Actually being interesting people. It’s like you have the dirt on everyone. E-mail the pictures off to the tabloids. You’ll make a mint. The celebrities will deny everything, and explain how they couldn’t possibly be doing this stuff, but everyone will just think that means it must be true. Don’t you want to rub successful people’s faces in the mud a little bit? Just a little? Doc? Admit it. You do. We’re talking a round one K here. Completely, completely, non-negotiable. Alright. Five hundred. 
 Dr. Richter: [silent for several seconds] Alright. You sold one anomalous item, responsible for the creation of cases of SCP-████, to an unknown female. Very well. I think that concludes this session… 
 SUBJECT: SCP-1840-J
INTERVIEWER: Dr. Richter
TIME/DATE: 5:02 23/09/███ 
 SCP-1840-J: Why hel-lo, Dr. Richter! The slayer of incorrectly filed Incident Reports! The man of a million calories! Seriously now, it’s good seeing you, it really is. Say, you know what you look like? A man who is irritated about the wide prevalence of stars in this galaxy. This will become important later. 
 Dr. Richter: Good morning, SCP-1840. We are resuming the interview we had three days ago. And, to recap, I will never, ever, purchase, borrow, rent, or lease any item, entity or being from you or associated third parties. Do not attempt to sell me anything. I trust we can talk professionally this time? 
 SCP-1840-J: Let me answer that question with another question. You’re kind of a pathetic angry dickwad, aren’t you? Hear me out. Your colleagues laugh at you. Your superiors bully you. Deep down, Doc, you’re probably thinking ‘My God! What does it take to get some RESPECT around here?’ Well, I’ll tell you: extraterrestrial doomsday devices. THAT will make your colleagues sit up and take notice. This [EXPLETIVE] is brilliant. Genuine, honest-to-God, Solar-System-destroying stuff. It can force a supernova through a series of focusing wormholes until you have pencil-thin beam of matter arriving at 98% the speed of light. Someone gets in the way of that? Blip! Dog meat. Them and anything within the surrounding three light years. ‘Ethics?’ you may say. ‘Morality?’ ‘Justice?’ I like to answer those questions with ‘I command a star-destroying directed energy cannon. Get the hell offa my lawn, Ethics.’ We’ll start at a hundred K. A steal. No, really, It’s stolen. If the Pattern Screamer gets wind of it, well, there is a slight risk of messy extradimensional death. 
 Dr. Richter: Believe me, I have become quite accustomed to these interruptions. Refer your offer along to Doctor Seaward. Now. I believe we were dealing with the third item you successfully sold. I’d like you to describe the item you sold, and the person you sold it to. 
 SCP-1840-J: Huh? Oh yeah. Right. Second person was a…Researcher. Tom. Or was it Tim? Can’t remember. Wanted a new pet for his daughter. Something exotic. Well…I had this dog that was spliced with a millipede. Long story. His daughter adores it though. And the parents loved how brilliantly it was received by the neighbours. They all moved away and never came back. He can’t thank me enough. Made a sweet two thousand off that thing. And to think I once thought it an abomination and tried to shoot it. How foolish I was. I’m afraid that was my only millipede dog, but I’ve got this weasel spliced with a phone if you’d like it. Cute. Functional. Nibbles your ear. Purrs when you send a text. We’ll call it a tenner. If you want more genetic abominations, I’m gonna have to need my nanobots back. 
 Dr. Richter: So that’s one SCP entity, of minimal threat level, currently in the custody of two unknown Foundation researchers and a juvenile, the male researcher possibly named ‘Tom’ or ‘Tim’. Very well. [sighs] We’ll come back to that. The third item you sold was what alerted us to your presence. You sold an anomalous artifact to a 24-year-old male employed by the Foundation as a Junior Researcher in studies relating to SCP-████. I would like you to discuss these events in your own words. 
 [This log has been cross-filed with Incident Report ████████] 
 SCP-1840-J: Oh yeah. That was a good one. I wasn’t on the sell that time, I was just relaxing back at home with a drink in hand. Completely shagged out after another day on the run from the Harlequin. Had to lie low in a strip club for eight hours. Grueling, man. Well, like I said, I was at home, when your Researcher… 
 Dr. Richter: Mr. T. Wales. 
 SCP-1840-J: Right, Terry. He phones me up. Said he got my number from someone. Wants to know if I’ve got anything that’ll get him a promotion. ‘I’ve been slaving away studying SCP-████ for three years now’ he says to me ‘I want a promotion and a transfer. I’ve got cash.’ So I hunt through my collection, and guess what? Performance-enhancing drugs. Origins and manufacturer unknown. Six syringes in a plastic box, marked ‘Batch 1679’ and ‘Evolutionary Stimulus. Testing only.’ Well, I’d managed to shake the Unbound Harlequin around Prague, but she was on my scent again and at this stage I’m not going to be all picky over safety. He had the money and was willing. Sold it. Hundred pounds. 
 Dr. Richter: Are you aware of what happened next? 
 SCP-1840-J: Well, he had to go inject himself right away, didn’t he? I was barely a block away when I heard the screams. I was horrified. I looked back. Park was awash with blood. Cars torn apart. Survivors screaming for help. It was just terrible. I mean it, I really do. I can’t live with myself. I just can’t live with myself knowing that I’ve made it even easier for the Harlequin to find me. God, can you imagine how I feel right now? 
 Dr. Richter: Yes, your drug appeared to have accelerated Mr. T. Wales through several million years of evolution into a sort of mammalian super-predator, before causing him to detonate. I suppose you realise thirteen people died? 
 SCP-1840-J: Jeez, man, you don’t have to rub it in. I feel awful. I really do. I can see the park from my apartment. They still haven’t finished repairing the damage. It’s a constant reminder. A constant reminder that the Harlequin is closing in on my sweet ass. 
 Dr. Richter: Thank you. We will resume this tomorrow…

 SUBJECT: SCP-1840-J
INTERVIEWER: Dr. Richter.
TIME/DATE: 9:07 24/09/███ 
 SCP-1840-J: Well slap my thigh and call me Susan, if it isn’t Dr. Richter himself! The man of action! The man of mystery! Please, regale me with some tale of your magnificence, my liege! 
 Dr. Richter: Good afternoon. I have a strange feeling you’re going to try and sell me something. 
 SCP-1840-J: Right on the money. I’d like to open this with a little mental image. Imagine, doctor, a desert. Wide. Endless. A huge infinity of sand. Nothing but the endless animal silence. But as you look around you, you see a small black speck crawling up one of the sand dunes. A baby camel. Lost. Staggering pointlessly onwards. The hot sand blowing in its eyes. Bleating for help. It staggers. Crawls back to its feet. Stumbles forward again.
And then high above in the azure sky, a small dark speck begins to circle. Then another. And another. Vultures. Preparing to feed. They circle lower…and lower…and the camel finally slumps into the dust, chest heaving, eyes staring, getting dim…and the first vulture settles on top of its exhausted body-cruel beak arching forward—
And that, Dr. Richter, is when the lamb bleats faintly—and then rips the head off the nearest vulture! It runs amok, killing left and right, until all the foul scavengers are mere piles of twisted flesh and settling feathers! For this is no ordinary baby camel, Dr. Richter, this is the Axtria Mock Camel, a strange creature that cunningly looks and acts like a starving baby camel in order to lure vultures to their untimely doom! 
 Dr. Richter: I see. And why should I buy one? 
 SCP-1840-J: I’m not asking you to buy it. I’m asking you to take it off my hands. I can’t control it. I’ve tried to kill it more times than I can count. It looks like a clumpy awkward quadruped but it moves like a snake. You should try getting it past customs. I can usually pass it off as a camel, but not when it’s gnawing on the bones of sinners. 
 Dr. Richter: Refer your offer along to Dr. Seaward, as usual. Now. I believe you are about to discuss the fourth and final sale you made. 
 SCP-1840-J: Sure, sure. So the final sale was just a week ago, actually. Best one yet. Except for the first one. That was the best as well. Sold four items at once. I got a call. You’re gonna love this. A D-Class had fallen in love with one of her Researchers. Real sweet. Ahh, true love. Who can understand its ways? I personally would have a few reservations about the man sending me into almost certain death against ravening sea serpents, but, ehhh, who am I to talk. Anyway, she wanted to bust herself and the Researcher out of here. She’d got it all planned. But she needed weapons. Explosives. A escape vehicle. A distraction. Yes, yes, yes and YES, Doc, I had those. 
 Dr. Richter: Am I to understand that a D-Class is preparing to breach a Foundation facility? My—my God! What did you sell her? Where is she? 
 SCP-1840-J: Oh it was amazing. Didn’t have the nerve to charge her. Who am I to stand in the way of love? So I gave her the deadliest stuff I had. Great to finally get rid of it. She said ‘Weapons’, and I said ‘Ex-Soviet Cyclic Charge Projector’. She said ‘Explosives’ and I said ‘Matter Negating Gauntlet’. She said ‘Escape Vehicle’ and I said ‘The Wainwright Teleport Array’ She said ‘Distractions’ and I said— 
 Agent Ness: Uhh, Doctor? This camel isn’t supposed to be contained or anything, is it? 
 Dr. Richter: Oh. Oh my— 
 SCP-1840-J: I had to. The females are the worst. I thought they were going to start breeding. Don't scream, or you'll excite it. 
 Agent Ness: Jeez, is it supposed to have that many—AHHHHHHH! AIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE! MY ARM! IT TOOK MY ARM! AHHHHHHH-ughhh…

 [D-27893 SHOOTS OUTSIDE]

 Dr. Richter: Make me reorganise my filing system, would you, ‘sir?’ Here’s what I think of YOUR system! 
 [ELECTRONIC BUZZ. COLLAPSING MASONARY] 
 Dr. Richter: Oh, to think I spent months reorganising my filing system! Oh, what a hugely advanced perspective on life a murderous woman and an arcane super weapon gives you!

SCP-1851-J,"""Fibber Lake""","""Item #: SCP-1851-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1851-J is to remain secured behind a 1 km perimeter under the pretext of environmental preservation with a staff of guards posted at Station 1851-J-Zeta. Scientific staff are to monitor SCP-1851-J's population daily for spikes or declines. 
 A public ""Shame on Fibbers"" disinformation campaign is to be undertaken to minimize the anomalous effects of SCP-1851-J. The local Foundation communications station, operating under the front of the Salmon, Carp, and Pike Fish Hatchery, is to remain in daily contact with personnel at Station-1851-Zeta. 
 Description: SCP-1851-J is a freshwater lake in the remote forest of [REDACTED] in the European country Cz[REDACTED]slovakia. SCP-1851-J is nearly circular in shape and has a diameter of roughly 2 km. It is teeming with large fish which appear to be non-anomalous other than some being saltwater fish who nonetheless survive in the freshwater environment. To the uninformed observer, it may appear that an improbable number of fish are leaping from the lake at all times. 
 SCP-1851-J's anomalous property is activated when any person misrepresents, tells a half-truth, or lies about the size of a fish that they nearly caught on a fishing trip. A fish corresponding to the description will appear instantaneously about 3 meters above SCP-1851-J. Most fish in the lake are about 1.75 meters in length, corresponding to the length of an average-sized male's outstretched arms. 
 SCP-1851-J's anomalous effects were discovered after an initial research team investigated the lake and collected several wildlife samples. Dr. ████ claimed before other researchers and locals in a village pub to have just been fishing and nearly caught a fish ""the size of a VW Beetle."" As he said this, the secondary team of researchers watched as such a fish materialized in the air above the surface of the lake and dropped into the water with a significant splash, capsizing the research canoe. 
 Fish-producing lies must be genuine. A researcher who is aware of the anomaly, for instance, cannot say ""I almost caught a fish this big [outstretched arms] made of solid gold"" and expect such a fish to materialize in SCP-1851-J. This serves as a reminder to researchers that not everything runs on SCP-261 rules, and you should not be thinking of anomalies as slot machines in the first place. 
 Whales, dolphins, and other aquatic mammals do not appear to be subject to the anomaly. Sharks, however, are; accordingly, it is imperative that knowledge of SCP-1851-J's effects does not reach certain GoIs. 
 Examination of water samples indicates a high concentration of plankton, kelp, and other detritus that the fish would feed on, meaning the ecosystem scales with the increasing population. The leading theory is that fish ""lie"" about their food acquisitions in a manner similar to human fishermen, leading to an appropriately sufficient level of sustenance in SCP-1851-J. Researchers have thus concluded that all fish are liars. 
 UPDATE: Researcher ██████'s proposal to use SCP-1851-J to feed SCP-2875 has been rejected. O-5 comments on the proposal ranged from ""why would we want to encourage a bunch of hungry fucking bears?"" to ""why would we compromise our favorite fishing spot like that?"" 
 Personnel exposed to SCP-1851-J for long amounts of time begin noticing deterioration in their thought patterns, as well as seeing and herring things. This may be a codnitohazard, but may reely be rogue researchers acting on porpoise, sowing discord for the halibut. Further investigation is required to quell the trouts of senior staff. 
 Offishoals should be notified of drastic changes in wildlife behavior or ecological composition. In short: if you sea some fin, say some fin.""",,+57,active,animal aquatic ectoentropic euclid joke location piscine scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1851-j
SCP-1861-J,"""Battle Hymn of the Foundation""","""Item #: SCP-1861-J 
 Object Class: Thaumiel 
 Special Containment Procedures: The original SCP-1861-J manuscript is to be maintained within a climate-controlled filer suitable for preserving 1700s parchment. Approved instances of SCP-1861-J-1 are to be stored for immediate access on all Foundation distributed media players and sound systems where activation does not conflict with other special containment procedures. 
 In the case of all Keter-class containment and Movie 43-class morale failures, an instance of SCP-1861-J-1 is to be immediately activated within audible reach of all involved Foundation personnel.1 Repetition of the SCP-1861-J-1 instance is to occur up to 12 times or until the failure is resolved. Should the failure not be resolved by the conclusion of 12 repetitions of an SCP-1861-J-1 instance, Plan 1861-J-9 is to be engaged. 
 Description: SCP-1861-J is the Foundation’s instrumental march or anthem, titled █████ ██ ████████ and composed by Frantisek Kotzwara in 1791.2 SCP-1861-J was discovered in the Foundation’s archives by Foundation personnel in 1947, contained in a manila envelope3 with the dedication “To My Dearest Friends at the Foundation.” It is unknown when SCP-1861-J originally came into the Foundation’s possession, or how Mr. Kotzwara was aware of the organization. 
 SCP-1861-J was made the Foundation’s official march in 1953 by order of the O5 Council.4 
 Whenever an instance of SCP-1861-J-1, an audio or audiovisual production or recording of such a production of SCP-1861-J, is heard by Foundation personnel, an almost immediate change in emotional and behavioral character is observed. The effects of SCP-1861-J-1 instances include: 
 These effects experience diminishing returns with each immediate repetition of SCP-1861-J-1 instances. 
 No anomalous activity has been noted with SCP-1861-J directly, nor with reproductions in writing or in photographs. However, Foundation personnel who simply imagine instances of SCP-1861-J-1 experience similar, but reduced, forms of the aforementioned effects. 
 Notes: “There are no official lyrics to accompany the Foundation’s march. Any lyrics provided by Dr. Bright are to be disregarded by Foundation personnel as possible memetic hazards.” ⁠—O5-█

SCP-1912-J,"""The Land of [REDACTED]""","""Item #: SCP-1912-J 
 Object Class: Safe (we promise we don’t bite) 
 Special Containment Procedures: Containment of SCP-1912-J is to fail at every possible opportunity. The cost and ridiculousness of keeping an object as large as SCP-1912-J hidden from the general population is too great a burden on the Foundation’s resources. Methods of failing SCP-1912-J's containment may include, but are not limited to: education campaigns, economic development, tourism advertisements and complaining on social media. 
 Description: SCP-1912-J is the entire state of New Mexico in the United States. SCP-1912-J measures 550km by 595km, with a total area of 315,000 km2, located between latitudes 31° 20’ to 37° N and longitudes 103° to 109° 3’ W. SCP-1912-J also contains over 2,085,000 instances of SCP-1912-J-1, which are capable of rapid self-replication, and communicate through such methods as Navajo, Spanish and English. 
 The anomalous activity of SCP-1912-J extends to its near-universal amnestic effects on witnesses. Regardless of its massive size, mention in school lessons and obvious showing on maps, almost all humans have no active memory that SCP-1912-J exists. The results of this effect include: 
 This effect does not appear to extend to non-human organisms, who have no awareness of SCP-1912-J's presence, nor of most political boundaries in the first place. 
 SCP-1912-J's development dates to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 after an anomalous tectonic land-shift saw the region transfer between Mexico and the United States. The creation of SCP-1912-J occurred on January 6, 1912 when 490 old white men in Washington, D.C., over 3000 km away, chanted and brought the object into being. Whether these men have any connection to The Church of the Broken God is still under investigation. 
 SCP-1912-J-1 instances have also been observed vaguely following the directions of a “Governor,” now classified as SCP-1912-J-2, who makes containment failure less attractive. 
 Addendum 1912-J-A: Due to the continued containment success of SCP-1912-J against the Foundation’s best efforts, the use of SCP-1912-J as a thaumiel-class object is currently under consideration by the O5 Council.

SCP-1914-J,"""Silencing Piano""","""Item #: SCP-1914-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1914-J is to be held in Containment Locker 37 at Site-19. Access may be granted by the current Site Director. 
 Description: SCP-1914-J is a Welte brand Reproduction style player piano. When SCP-1914-J is activated, it produces an environment reminiscent of early silent films. These effects spread to a maximum radius of 980 meters, however the range of the effect may be controlled by SCP-1914-J's volume dial. This effect will cease once SCP-1914-J's music sheet ends. This music sheet is interchangeable with other compatible ones, and the effect may be extended to up to two hours. The music SCP-1914-J creates is broadcast throughout the area of effect. No other sound besides this can be produced within the radius. 
 All surfaces within SCP-1914-J's area of effect lose all color, retaining shades of grey. The architecture of buildings may become more exaggerative (e.g. large buildings may gain decorative figures and become taller, small houses may become villas or cottages). Modern technology will be transformed into early age counterparts, or, if the item did not exist around the 1920s era, it will be transformed into a fantastic or impossible object (Dr. ██████████'s personal laptop changed into a large metal mechanism with hydraulic arms labelled ""Dr. ██████████'s Calculation Machine"". The object made several motions however the output was indecipherable). Advertisements and decorative features will change to become era appropriate. Subjects gain clothing expressive of their occupation or situation. Subjects also tend to show much more exaggerative expressions and actions, as well as a larger tendency to be mischievous or aggressive. 
 Probability manipulation also appears to take place; objects such as vaults or pianos will generally fall from ropes or windowsills, in spite of no plans for said objects to be moved. While subjects tend to be caught in such accidents, no recorded instances of subjects dying from accidents have been recorded. However, ~23% of subjects require medical care, and show a tendency to obtain obtrusive casts or bandages in several areas of the body, even when obtaining care outside of the area of effect. 
 Objects or subjects removed from the area of effect retain their lack of colouration and are unable to produce sound. However, subjects will actively resist being removed from the radius. These effects do not take place if the radius shrinks due to a change in SCP-1914-J's ""volume"", or when SCP-1914-J finishes its music sheet. 
 Over time subjects will accidentally wrong one another, causing mischievous or malicious acts in response. Although initially this may simply be ""slapstick"" violence, lethal acts such as dropping a large weight on the subject or forcing the subject into a vehicle and driving off a cliff will occur following prolonged exposure.

 Description: During an attempted attack on Site-19 by Chaos Insurgency operatives, SCP-1914-J was accidentally activated during a retreat into the containment locker area. Site-19 was encapsulated by SCP-1914-J's area of effect. Security staff immediately gained the uniform of an English ""bobby"", and were armed with nightsticks and small Glocks. Conversely, Chaos Insurgency operatives were dressed as traditional cat burglars, with assorted handguns. The two parties engaged each other approximately 10 minutes after SCP-1914-J's activation. Instead of usual tactics, both parties engaged in direct one-on-one combat. SCP-1914-J appeared to have an effect on the engagement. Some examples of SCP-1914-J assisted maneuvers include: Security Head ██████████ making an operative follow his hand movements before poking the operative in both eyes, Agent █████ ramming an operative onto the ground, where the operative got his head stuck in a paint can, and Agent ██████████████ shaking a champagne bottle and hitting an operative with the cork. Unfortunately, Agent ████████ suffered several broken limbs following an operative ""accidentally"" hitting Agent ████████ with a jalopy.

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to the risk of a TK-class Technological Collapse Event, SCP-1938 is to be kept away from computers computing devices anything with a goddamn network interface at all costs. 
 Description: SCP-1938 is Dr. Mary-Ann Walker, a Level 2 anthropology researcher currently employed by the Foundation at Humanoid Containment Site 06-3 with the anomalous ability to infect any electronic device with a multitude of viruses, malware, and spyware within hours of use. SCP-1938 also has a catastrophic effect on the behavior of site information technology and security personnel, forcing them to laugh uncontrollably, break down into tears, then become incoherently angry at life (generally in that order). 
 This ability is suspected to result from SCP-1938's inability to understand that all those retarded ""click me"" emails aren't actually telling you that you won some stupid prize or that a hundred puppies will die if you don't forward the goddamn thing. 
 SCP-1938 came to the attention of Site 06-3's technical staff following an incident in which she reported sluggish computer performance and requested assistance. The responding technician performed a cursory inspection of the affected terminal and discovered that its hard drive contained a physically impossible amount of viruses.

SCP-1950-J,"""Locked away in the tallest Containment Cell""","""Item #: SCP-1950-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1950-J is to be housed in a tower Standard Foundation Single occupant elevated cylindrical containment room. Subject is to be provided with tattered clothes, scraps from Site 19 kitchen, household cleaning implements, and books in the fantasy or adventure genre; preferably ones featuring romantic subplots and fanciful settings SCP-1950-J-1 will never get to experience. At all times, two ugly security personnel and/or researchers of a similar age to SCP-1950-J’s appearance must be on hand to deliver appropriate insults and demands for menial labor. 
 As of incident SCP-1950-J-Gamma, subject is no longer to be allowed out of her cell under any circumstances. 
 Personnel assigned to SCP-1950-J must be screened for musical ability. Any staff with a capacity for performing song/dance routines must not work in close proximity to SCP-1936-J-1. Personnel infected by SCP-1950-J-2 must be administered Class B amnestics, followed by a 4-week period of quarantined observation. In the event this treatment is ineffective, the personnel must be terminated to prevent spreading the infection. 
 Any instance of SCP-1950-J-3 and associated anomalous beings are to be dealt with according to procedure 666. 
 Description: SCP-1950-J refers to SCP-1950-J-1 and its related effects. SCP-1950-J-1 is a human female of European lineage, with the only outwardly anomalous feature being eyes and pupils that are 5 times the human average, body proportions that would make normal human functions, such as eating, impossible, and perpetually appearing to be 18 years old. Interviews with 1950-J-1 has determined that she was the daughter of the king in exile of the kingdom of [DATA EXPUNGED]. No records exist of this country. 
 SCP-1950-J-1 was discovered in the home of senior researcher Barbaracia, who came to be the sole guardian of her, following the death of 1950-J-1’s original father in a freak and tragic stabbing accident. After keeping her as a household servant and forcing her to dress in rags and eat only crumbs and garbage, SCP-1950-J-1 began to manifest its first and primary anomalous feature. 
 On 27/11/13, SCP-1950-J began to manifest its primary anomalous feature, the production of SCP-1950-J-2, which was in turn reproduced by researcher Barbaracia. SCP-1950-J-2 is a memetic audio frequency that takes the form of a variety of songs sung by 1950-J-1, but all reproductions and recordings have similar effects. These songs vary in length, complexity and style, seemingly at random, though remaining consistent for years at a time before shifting to a different style. However, these songs always retain a similar lyrical focus on themes of discovery, hope, a longing for true love, believing in yourself, and other subject matter we do not need to reinforce to the other anomalies. 
 1950-J-2’s primary anomalous effect comes when it is heard by an object or creature that is itself anomalous, be it thaumatological or technological. Upon being exposed to an instance of 1950-J-2, all living, sapient anomalous beings enter a trance-like state for .34 seconds, after which they flock to whatever is emitting it, and begin joining in the instance, providing chorus singing, backup vocals, harmony parts, and choreographed dance numbers. Non-living anomalous items will manifest large, cartoonish eyeballs from random places (including hovering in mid-air for noncorporeal or abstract concept anomalies), and join in as if they were sentient. 
 During its prolonged containment, 1950-J-1 has demonstrated the ability to either attract or spontaneously generate instances of 1950-J-3. 1950-J-3 refers to a male humanoid of diverse possible racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, but all with roughly the same face and personality. 1950-J-3 displays an acute knowledge of the precise Foundation facility that 1950-J-1 is being contained at, and each instance will attempt to assault the facility, along with a variety of magical allies, collectively referred to as SCP-1950-J-4 until individual capture and classification. All instances of 1950-J-4 have so far displayed a preference for behaviour deemed ""marketable"" over actions that would assist in freeing 1950-J-1. 
 Procedure 666: In the event of an attack on site by an SCP-1950-J-3 instance and associated beings, researchers and security personnel are to, in all cases, resist the urge to transform into a giant monstrous form to attack them as “you really are”. Please keep in mind that this has a very low success rate, and even when successful, has tended to make returning to usual functions difficult. Instead, security personnel are encouraged to just shoot the present 1950-J-3 instance, usually the prettiest one, in the head. Lacking the leadership of the -3 instance and “the hope of seeing true loves first kiss”, the other beings can be contained and classified easily. 
 Incident 1950-J-Gamma: 
 Transcript taken from recording of SCP-1950-J-1's scheduled exercise period, taken in a nearby meadow at SCP-1950-J-1's request. This is the first fully recorded instance of 1950-J-2, during which she ran through the grass. 
 SCP-1950-J-1: Where am I now? Is it a place to fear?
What will I see, more snarls and more sneers?
Am I to live just shuttered away?
Never again, to see the light, of day? 
 This warmth….I know it. From years before.
The light, is a light, I’d give the world for
The blades ‘neath my feet, not the cold concrete cell,
have I finally escaped, that cold, emotionless hell? 
 The sweet smell of summer is still on the air,
As sweet as smile of my prince, tall and fair,
They told me my people no longer remain,
But I know that somehow I'll bring them all back, again 
 It's out there, my home, my people, calling me back to them
Out there, somewhere, be it in Cairo or Bethlehem,
I can't stop, I can't wait, I can't get distracted,
I know I can do it, if I just [REDACTED] 
 They’ll be back, they’ll be home, they’ll be free,
I know it can happen, so just wait and see,
And it will all be, because of me,
If I can only be, where I need to be. 
 Sr. Researcher Sherman: Man, there’s just something so empowering, seeing her run off like that. 
 Security Personnel Lopez: Hey, is she gonna come back? 
 (3 second silence) 
 Sr. Researcher Sherman: Oh, son of a…. 
 Rest of recording consists of Researcher Sherman swearing copiously. 
 Addendum: As of 20/03/2016, possible passive additional effect of SCP-1950-J has been observed. Upon being informed of the latest foiled attempt by SCP-1950-J-3 to breach containment, Administrator Jensen was observed rubbing their hands, cackling, and saying “Good, Soon I WILL BE THE PRETTIEST OF ALL! MUAHAHAHAH!” As of writing, Administrator Jensen is still relatively unattractive, even by the common standards of bald 93-year-old men.

SCP-1955-J,"""Musical Audio Surveillance Distortion""","""Item #: SCP-1955-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: All Foundation facilities must maintain separate video and audio surveillance systems under the guise of aiding memetic containment. Under no circumstances are video surveillance devices which are also capable of recording audio to be installed in any Foundation site. 
 Foundation operatives are to infiltrate manufacturers and distributors of surveillance equipment and ensure that security networks combining both audio and video recording capabilities remain either prohibitively expensive or subject to debilitating technical flaws. 
 Description: SCP-1955-J is an anomalous form of audio distortion known to impact video surveillance recordings in all Foundation facilities. This effect does not occur with systems recording either video or audio independently, even when such systems are recording the same events as SCP-1955-J affected recordings. 
 SCP-1955-J tends to appear when the following conditions are met:
- At least three mobile entities1 are visible to one or more surveillance devices.
- The entitles interact for more than 30 seconds.
- One or more of the entities could be described as ""pursuing"" or ""fleeing"" another entity. 
 When these conditions are met, any audio recorded by affected devices will be completely replaced by an energetic, high-tempo arrangement of saxophone and other brass instruments typically described by personnel as ""raucous"" or ""saucy."" Furthermore, any dramatic events within these recordings (e.g., physical collisions, rapid containment barrier extension, graphic evisceration, or [DATA EXPUNGED]) are punctuated with exaggerated sounds produced by obscure instruments such as bicycle horns, slide whistles, or zithers.2 (For example SCP-1955-J recordings, See Addendum 1955-J-1.) 
 SCP-1955-J distortions are capable of spreading between recording devices and systems, with the audio distortion transferring between recordings as entities exit or enter the views of other devices. New entities entering a SCP-1955-J recording are capable of extending its effect if they either enter a physical altercation with an originating entity or if they begin to pursue or flee such entities. 
 Given the pervasive presence of surveillance networks and handheld video recording in first-world nations, any SCP-1955-J affected entities escaping a Foundation facility could result in a global BH-class salacious media scenario.

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1960-J is currently uncontained, and no practical means of either bringing it into containment or destroying it has yet been developed. As SCP-1960-J is uncontained, extremely dangerous, and virtually impossible to destroy, the Foundation's current approach toward interaction with SCP-1960-J focuses on observation and study, primarily from a safe distance or via the use of robotic drones. Any personnel attempting to directly contact SCP-1960-J must be wearing heavy-duty full environmental suits with integrated life support systems. 
 Description: SCP-1960-J is a free-floating sphere made of white stone which moves in a continuous circular path, despite lacking any visible means of support or propulsion. In addition to its unusual movements, SCP-1960-J exhibits a number of other anomalous properties: 
 Exploration Log SRV-3: Robotic probe SRV-3 equipped with camera and a variety of scientific instruments dispatched to study SCP-1960-J. Probe determined that SCP-1960-J is made primarily of basalt and provided close-up pictures of its surface, but encountered numerous interruptions to wireless data transmission and ultimately ceased operating. 
 Exploration Log A1: While preparing for their mission, team A1's transport bursts into spontaneous flame, burning with unnatural speed and temperature. All three team members are lost. Foundation scientists conclude that SCP-1960-J may have a psychic and/or sentient component. SCP-1960-J upgraded to Keter. Subsequent missions feature fireproof materials and clothing. 
 [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Exploration Log A11: Three Foundation personnel dispatched to make direct contact with SCP-1960-J. All three were equipped with heavy-duty full environmental suits in the hopes that they will be able to survive the life-draining effect of contacting it. ██████ remains in the transport to monitor the attempt and maintain wireless communications with the Foundation. ██████ and ██████ successfully touch SCP-1960-J and survive. Destructive analysis is authorized, and with difficulty team A11 returns with a small sample for study. Team A11 carefully attaches a rangefinding device to SCP-1960-J, designed to carefully monitor its precise distance from Foundation headquarters and determine whether an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario is a possibility. 
 Exploration Log A12: Mission parameters very similar to A11, but an increased level of supplies allows for a longer mission. A12 is also tasked with investigating SRV-3, and ultimately returns with several components of the broken robot for later analysis. 
 Exploration Log A13: While drawing close to SCP-1960-J, A13's transport was damaged by [DATA EXPUNGED]. The resulting explosion crippled the transport, leaving the crew unable to complete their mission. A13 was able to abort the mission and return to headquarters with no loss of life. 
 [DATA EXPUNGED] 
 Exploration Log A17: Mission team A17 was equipped with a purpose-built SCP-1960-J Roving Vehicle, allowing them to study SCP-1960-J's surface in great detail. Team A17 detonated several explosives on SCP-1960-J to study the practicality of destroying SCP-1960-J, but the resulting damage was minor. SCP-1960-J is considered essentially indestructible.

 Containment Procedures: SCP-1981-J-1 is to be kept in a lonely world. Once per week, it is to be escorted by a contingent of agents from MTF Eta-10 (Perry’s Pipers) onto the midnight train going anywhere.1 SCP-1981-J-2 is to be contained in South Detroit, where it was born and raised. It is also to be escorted by MTF Eta-10 onto the midnight train going anywhere. No contact is to be allowed between SCP-1981-J-1 and -2 until they arrive at their destination. 
 Once SCP-1981-J-1 and -2 arrive at their destination, they are to be kept in a smoky room, which contains a singer, the smell of wine and cheap perfume. Should SCP-1981-J-1 smile at SCP-1981-J-2, or vice-versa, after 6 PM, ESCAPE Protocol is to be enacted immediately.2 
 Description: SCP-1981-J consists of two shadows, searching in the night. They were discovered up and down the boulevard in ███████, Ontario, by strangers who had been waiting for the bus. SCP-1981-J are predatory metamorphic organisms, capable of altering their forms at will; however, they both have forms which are highly preferred. SCP-1981-J-1 most commonly takes the form of streetlights, while SCP-1981-J-2 prefers the form of people. It is currently unknown if SCP-1981-J are alive; they are able to communicate, and their metamorphic abilities allow for facial expressions and body language, but they posses no vital signs, and are unwilling to cooperate in experiments. Current theories suggest that SCP-1981-J are living just to find emotion. Interviews with witnesses to SCP-1981-J's capture suggested that there were additional instances hiding somewhere in the night; MTF Eta-10 is on the lookout, but has not found any evidence to suggest this. See Incident 1981-J-A.

SCP-1987-J,"""Bitchin' Solo""","""Item #: SCP-1987-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: All printed copies or recordings of SCP-1987-J are to be destroyed, except for a single printed copy to be stored in a locked safe at Site 5150. One six-string electric guitar, of any standard model, is to be made available for testing purposes. As of ██/██/20██, testing is to be conducted by and on D-class personnel only. Any people or objects affected by SCP-1987-J are to be examined immediately after conclusion of test and archived or neutralized as necessary. Female staff members are not to be exposed to SCP-1987-J's effects under any circumstances. 
 In the event of a manifestation of SCP-1987-J-1, the D-class responsible for activating SCP-1987-J is to accept its request. No staff are to interact with SCP-1987-J-1 directly. Test subject may be reassigned in event of failure; in event of success, Procedure Counter-XK-25R624 is to be enacted immediately. 
 Mobile Task Force Omega-2112 (""Beaumont Police Department"") is to monitor major and independent music publishers and online music distribution networks for any indication of an independent rediscovery of SCP-1987-J. In the event of a containment breach, all offending media is to be removed from public consumption and MTF Omega-2112 is authorized to execute Procedure Kasem, Procedure Sumner, or Procedure Cobain at O5 discretion. 
 Description: SCP-1987-J is a sequence of chords intended to be played on an electric guitar, which produces several anomalous effects when played. SCP-1987-J has been discovered independently by several individuals since the development of the electric guitar in the 1930s. The earliest known written copy exists in the form of a hand-written tabulature dated to 1965, with the note ""To J.H. - pretty cool, huh? -L.R."" in the margin. 
 Extensive testing has indicated that any person who is aware of how SCP-1987-J is intended to sound when played, and has access to an electric guitar and amplifier, is able to produce SCP-1987-J, regardless of any previously documented ability to play guitar or lack thereof. Once play begins, anomalous effects begin to occur within the area where SCP-1987-J is audible after approximately 1.6 seconds, and continue to manifest every 10-30 seconds, until play ceases or SCP-1987-J-1 manifests. No specific pattern as to the effects produced by SCP-1987-J-1 has been discerned to date. All effects produced by SCP-1987-J are permanent and are not reversed by cessation of play or subsequent exposure. Effects documented as a result of SCP-1987-J include: 
 Testing has determined that all above effects are only produced when SCP-1987-J is performed on an electric guitar. Attempts to produce SCP-1987-J on acoustic guitar, keyboard, banjo, ukulele, or saxophone have produced a memetic field which causes all observers to view the player as ""uncool"" or ""a sellout"", with extended test sessions resulting in permanent [REDACTED] testicles. 
 SCP-1987-J-1 is an entity resembling a Caucasian male of approximately 25 years age, which to date has manifested on any occasion when performance of SCP-1987-J has passed a collective total of three minutes, one second in duration. SCP-1987-J-1, which has variously introduced itself by the names ""Count Rockula"", ""Sir Rocksalot"", and ""the Lord of the Strings"", will immediately upon manifesting order the player to cease and challenge him or her to what it describes as an ""Epic Rockdown of Rocktimate Rockstiny"", which has been observed to take the form of a ""guitar duel"" between SCP-1987-J-1 and the player, with the offer of ""Ultimate Rockness"" if the player is successful. 
 The nature of ""Ultimate Rockness"" has yet to be determined - in all observed instances, SCP-1987-J-1 has declared itself the winner and demanifested, followed by the player's spontaneous transformation into an instance of SCP-1987-J-2 - an unattractive male (regardless of the player's original gender) approximately 45 years of age, wearing the uniform of a gas station attendant, which identifies itself as ""Earl"", and claims to be a fan of country music. All instances of SCP-1987-J-2 have proven unable to produce SCP-1987-J or to display any degree of skill with the guitar, and have been assigned to the maintenance of the Foundation's motor pool. 
 Memo from Dr. Klein: As of ██/██/20██, I am hereby forbidding all staff other than D-class from conducting tests on SCP-1987-J. To date, thirty-eight researchers at Site 5150 alone have become iterations of SCP-1987-J-2 while attempting to acquire the power of Ultimate Rockness. Site 1137 is now facing a five-month backlog on critical laboratory work; however, we possess well in excess of the required automobile maintenance staff, and will have to resort to assigning the SCP-1987-J-2 instances as D-class due to a lack of work to assign them. As tempting as Ultimate Rockness may be, we have more important concerns at this time.""","""Partial SCP-1987-J tabulature""",+153,active,_cc acoustic euclid joke musical scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-1987-j
SCP-1992-J,"""Hype Train""","""Item #: SCP-1992 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: If the existence of an SCP-1992-1 is confirmed, Foundation agents are to attempt to persuade passengers to disembark. Foundation personnel are advised to not board the train, regardless of how persuasive the arguments of the passengers are. 
 Should Foundation personnel fail to keep an instance of SCP-1992-1 from crashing, MTF-Gamma-5 (""Red Herrings"") are to secure the crash site, disseminate information concerning the crash, and identify all passengers. Survivors are to be taken to hospitals under Foundation control until release to their residency and given Class B amnestics. Cover stories are to be fabricated for the deceased at the discretion of MTF-Gamma-5. 
 Description: SCP-1992 is a worldwide phenomenon focused around various forms of media including novels, music, movies, television programs, video games, comic books, and internet-based media. SCP-1992 physically manifests in the form of an autonomous passenger train, designated SCP-1992-1. Multiple instances of SCP-1992-1 are capable of existing at once. 
 SCP-1992 events begin with the announcement of a piece of media that is met with widespread enthusiasm; a variable researchers have tentatively termed ""hype."" However, an instance of SCP-1992-1 will not manifest for every anticipated piece of media. It is unknown how exactly SCP-1992 selects its sources, though it it hypothesized it selects media that will cause the most damage. It is theorized SCP-1992-1 will only preemptively manifest to represent media that are met with a largely negative reaction upon release. If true, it is unknown whether SCP-1992 is able to predict the quality of upcoming media, or retroactively affects the source media upon manifestation or media release, as the creators of the media are often confused by the negative reception. 
 Upon manifestation, individuals who hold interest in the relevant upcoming media are subject to a minor compulsion to board the train. SCP-1992-1 will disappear shortly after departing from the station. As more people board the SCP-1992-1, the range and strength of the compulsion increases. Those aboard SCP-1992-1 are theorized to subsist on ""hype"" rather than typical sustenance of food and water. 
 Upon the media's release, the relevant SCP-1992-1 will manifest somewhere on a rail line in the media's country of origin. The SCP-1992-1 will travel at a velocity dependent on the total number of those who have boarded. It will continue along the rail line until it either arrives at the next station, or derails due to excessive velocity.

SCP-2000-J,"""Dunky the Funky Werecat 2000: Werecat Strikes Back""","""Item #: SCP-2000-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2000-J is currently being housed at Dr. █████'s household, who had originally offered SCP-2000-J housing off the street.1 
 SCP-2000-J is now being hosted by Agent ████, who is currently going to college. Considerations to place SCP-2000-J onto MTF Zeta-00 (""Fuzzbutts"") are pending. 
 Description: SCP-2000-J is a Caucasian male approximately 18 years of age, with the ability to transform into a common housecat upon the beginning of any sport he participates in. In spite of his apparent lack of height or hands, he shows an exemplary ability at any athletics while in a transformed state. 
 SCP-2000-J appears to have an odd memetic effect upon regulators of any sport, causing apathy towards his lack of qualifications to play in his current state. Typically regulators will cite a lack of regulation towards disallowing animals from participating. SCP-2000-J also appears to increase the morale of any team he participates in, regardless of actual performance. 
 SCP-2000-J seems to be able to perform reality manipulation, causing him to always be able to perform the last goal, basket, run, strike, or catch during a tie in the game. Although randomized, during tournaments any team that SCP-2000-J participates in will be able to play into the finals, and the final team will always be the previous championship team. As well, previously undiscovered conflicts between members of both teams will arise during the match and will become resolved positively.2 
 Addendum 2000-J-1: SCP-2000-J recently requested that Agent ████ become romantically involved with it. Agent ████ denied this request as she is currently in a steady relationship with the leader of Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (""The Jocks""). 
 Addendum 2000-J-2: Due to SCP-2000-J's difficulties in interacting with female staff members and physical abuse by several humanoid SCP's, the decision has been made to insert SCP-2000-J into the Foundation's Basketball Team in hopes of finally winning against the Global Occult Coalition. 
 Addendum 2000-J-3: SCP-2000-J has recently assembled an improved team to represent the Foundation, consisting of several researchers, Agents and humanoid SCP's. 
 Addendum 2000-J-4: On ██/██/20███, SCP-2000-J approached Dr. █████, requesting that he join Athletic Task Force Alpha-11. Due to Dr. █████'s unpleasant history involving the game, he refused, advising SCP-2000-J to cease playing basketball before it experiences a similar negative experience. 
 Addendum 2000-J-5: The Foundation-GOC annual basketball tournament is currently underway. Updates are pending. 
 Addendum 2000-J-6: Astonishingly, Dr. █████ has attended the game and is assisting Athletic Task Force Alpha-11. SCP-2000-J appears to register satisfaction at this development. 
 Addendum 2000-J-7: One of the members of the GOC team has terminated Dr. █████ with a concealed pistol. The GOC player has been removed from the game by Assistant Referee ███████. During the mid-game break, SCP-2000-J expressed determination to win the game. 
 Addendum 2000-J-8: SCP-2000-J has gained possession of the ball and is rapidly approaching the GOC hoop and YES HE MADE THE SHOT YESSSS 
 Addendum 2000-J-9: SCP-2000-J is currently in a steady relationship with Agent ████. Termination of Agent ████ for unprofessional behaviour is under consideration. 
 Addendum 2000-J-10: SCP-2000-J was approached by Marshall, Carter and Dark operatives with a deal for him to lose the next game in exchange for monetary rewards. He initially refused; however, the operatives then threatened Agent ████'s safety. SCP-2000-J then proceeded to perform poorly in the next game until Agent ████ escaped and cheered him on.

SCP-2001-J,"""Laser Butt Disease""","""Item #: SCP-2001-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-2001-J are to be thoroughly destroyed after testing. 
 Description: SCP-2001-J is a species of mammalian gut flora which is a variant of Lactobacillus reuteri. Upon consumption of foodstuff contaminated by SCP-2001-J, a mammal's native population of Lactobacillus reuteri will be replaced by SCP-2001-J. This process occurs over a period of two to three days, and typically goes unnoticed by the host organism. 
 When a coherent population of SCP-2001-J is agitated, as may occur due to gastrointestinal stresses, they adhere to one another, a process which is facilitated by rapid generation of cobalamin. SCP-2001-J bacteria will align along the common axis of cobalamin generation. This process causes a thin, unicellular sheet of SCP-2001-J to form. When agitation ceases, SCP-2001-J will coherently bioluminesce along the axis perpendicular to the sheet. The degree of luminescence involved is in the order of 3 watts per SCP-2001-J bacterium, however, the luminescence will typically cease after approximately 50 milliseconds. This results in a directed, coherent light source similar to that of a multiple kilowatt laser, projected from the posterior of the infectee. 
 Addendum 1: Research into weaponising SCP-2001-J is ongoing. 
 Addendum 2: The first MTF team equipped exclusively with SCP-2001-J infections, ""Laser Butt Squad"", has been created to combat the spread of SCP-789-J.""",,+139,active,bacteria euclid joke light scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-butt-j
SCP-2002-J,"""The -J stands for Jaywalker""","""by stormbreath 
 Item Number: SCP-2002-J 
 Object Class: Neutralized 
 Special Containment Procedures: Copies of this file are to be distributed to all individuals in the Foundation, and are to be declared mandatory reading. A documentary concerning the life and times of SCP-2002-J1 is in production, and will be screened for all Foundation personnel once completed. 
 Description: SCP-2002-J was a man incapable of jaywalking. Whenever SCP-2002-J attempted to cross a street in a fashion that would legally be considered jaywalking, a possible but statistically improbable event would occur to redefine said attempt to not be considered jaywalking. 
 SCP-2002-J was captured on August 4th, 2018 after repeatedly disrupting the flow of traffic in downtown Indianapolis with its anomalous capabilities. During this period, it was incoherently ranting about its supremacy over motor vehicle operators. 
 Interview Log: 
 [BEGIN LOG] 
 Dr. Jones: Hello SCP-2002-J. This interview is to establish the origin- 
 SCP-2002-J: I was sick of having to look both ways before crossing the street so I made a Faustian pact with a demon. 
 Dr. Jones: I- 
 SCP-2002-J: Worst part of my day. I hate looking for oncoming traffic. There are so many better things that I could be doing, like cutting to the chase and crossing the street unimpeded, without fear of motor vehicles that are being driven towards me. 
 Dr. Jones: Wh- 
 SCP-2002-J: Such is the burden of man! We find ourselves bound by traffic laws and regulations in the same way we find ourselves bound by death. Oh, how I long for a world without traffic laws, but unless a secret government project executed the conceptual personification of such thought, those wishes are hopeless. But perhaps there is another way for a single man to ascend‽ 
 Dr. Jones: But- 
 SCP-2002-J: So I murdered a hobo and summoned a crossroads demon (the arbiters of the Fourth Circle of Hell, which is tar, specifically the tar of the road) and made a deal with him: my sole (and the hobo, but who cares about him) in exchange for total and unmitigated immunity to all laws of jaywalking. 
 Dr. Jones: You- 
 SCP-2002-J: And it worked! I am a demigod now (with the regard to the street)! The great deities of traffic bow before me, for I shatter their divine laws beneath my feet every time I use an intersection, and there is nothing they can do to stop my rule! My power is limitless! Let me ask you a question, and then provide the answer without giving you a chance to respond: Why did the chicken cross the road‽ TO DEFY THE HEAVENS! 
 Dr. Jones: For jaywalking‽ You sold your soul for jaywalking‽ 
 SCP-2002-J: Just so we're clear that's the shoe one. I gave up one of my shoes. 
 [END LOG] 
 Testing Log: 
 Scenario: SCP-2002-J is ordered to cross the street when the sign is not lit. 
 Result: The sign becomes lit as soon as SCP-2002-J enters the roadway. 
 Notes: A simple baseline test of SCP-2002-J's anomalous effect. This is the most common result. — Dr. Jones 
 Scenario: SCP-2002-J is ordered to cross the street just after the pedestrian sign has changed from Walk to Stop. 
 Result: No change is immediately noted. SCP-2002-J is able to cross the street unimpeded, as all traffic had been halted for the purposes of the test. 
 Notes: Analysis of the Foundation's treaty concerning Site-19 with local government indicates that we are exempt from all of our host country's laws, and moreover, the Site-19 legal code never incorporated a clause to penalize the act of jaywalking. Therefore, under the jurisdiction of this test, jaywalking was never illegal. — Sheldon Katz, /s/ 
 Scenario: SCP-2002-J is ordered to cross the street after the sign has changed. This test conducted within an urban area where jaywalking has been confirmed to be illegal. 
 Result: SCP-2002-J enters the road. As soon as it enters the road, preparations for a parade close the road three blocks away. It is determined that jaywalking is not illegal when the road has been closed. 
 Notes: Damn Confetti International and their Antimemes Day Parade! — Dr. Marachek 
 Scenario: SCP-2002-J is ordered to cross the street after the sign has changed in a region that has been verified to have legal stipulations against jaywalking. The surrounded area has been checked for parades and verified to not have any scheduled. 
 Result: SCP-2002-J enters the roadway. As soon as it does so, a law is passed by the local legislature, stipulated to go into effect immediately, that decriminalizes jaywalking. 
 Notes: I am unstoppable. — SCP-2002-J 
 Scenario: SCP-2002-J is ordered to cross the street after the sign has changed. The laws of the region have been verified to include prohibitions against jaywalking, and no pending legislature is in place to change such legislature. No parades or other events that would result in street closure are scheduled nearby. 
 Result: SCP-2002-J enters the roadway. As soon as it does, a meteor lands in the street, causing significant damage and resulting in street closure. 
 Notes: Dr. Jones was struck by the meteor, and fucking died. — O5-13 
 Scenario: SCP-2002-J is ordered to cross the street. The laws of the region have been verified to include prohibitions against jaywalking, and no pending legislature is in place to change such legislature. All lawmakers have been held hostage by Standard Political Slowment Plan 10292. No parades or other events that would result in street closure are scheduled nearby, and armed guards are in place to prevent spontaneous parading. An artillery unit has been set up near the test and is monitoring the sky for any atmospheric entry, ready to destroy any errant falling rocks. A contained thaumaturge forced into indentured servitude has been gang-pressed into compliance to ensure meteorological events do not result in street closure. 
 Result: SCP-2002-J enters the crosswalk. The light changes as soon as they enter. As they are crossing the street, they are struck by a motor vehicle that had illegally driven through the red light, fatally injuring SCP-2002-J. 
 Notes: And that's why you always look both ways before crossing the street, kids! — Dr. Clef""",,+169,active,chaos-insurgency doctor-clef humanoid joke neutralized probability sapient scp sentient sheldon-katz,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2002-j
SCP-2006-J,"""Metamorphic Eldritch Entity""","""Item #: SCP-2006-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2006-J is detained in a hermetically sealed and triple-reinforced biological containment cell at Site 138-Delta. Any maintenance of this cell is to be performed via automated means; personnel are strictly forbidden from entering the 100 m 200 m radius Red Zone around the cell except during experimentation. 
 Experimentation or communication with SCP-2006-J-1 may only be performed with prior permission from the Site 138-Delta Site Director, must be directly overseen by at least two (2) Level 3 Senior Researchers, and may not exceed twenty (20) minutes in duration. Any personnel admitted to the Red Zone of SCP-2006-J must undergo mandatory psychiatric screening afterwards, and personnel exhibiting unusual behavior or psychological trauma must be administered an amnestic of at least Class B strength and transferred or terminated as seen fit by oversight staff. 
 Once per month, one (1) Class D personnel slated for termination is to be delivered into SCP-2006-J's chamber for ""punishment"". There is no conclusive evidence that SCP-2006-J requires food, water, oxygen, or sustenance of any kind, but the introduction of this containment procedure has reduced containment breach incidents by 99%. 
 Description: SCP-2006-J-1 is a sentient, sapient entity of possibly extraterrestrial or extradimensional origin that causes catastrophic psychological damage to human subjects that observe it directly. Physical descriptions from test subjects exposed to SCP-2006-J-1 are inconclusive, but such subjects consistently describe a ""mass of writhing tentacles, adorned with serpentine eyes"". SCP-2006-J-1 is capable of telepathic communication with human subjects within 75 m, which has allowed for research staff to interview the entity. However, this can also cause severe psychological damage and/or brain hemorrhage in subjects exposed for more than thirty (30) minutes. SCP-2006-J-1 claims to be female, but this claim cannot be corroborated at this time. 
 Upon initial recovery, SCP-2006-J-1 was in possession of SCP-2006-J-2 and SCP-2006-J-3. These are, respectively, a hand-sewn article of clothing resembling a short white and pink dress made from lace-lined silk sized for SCP-2006-J-1 and a crudely crafted artifact resembling a baton or wand adorned with a crescent moon and a rough-cut ruby. While neither object has exhibited any anomalous properties, they appear to have significant sentimental value to SCP-2006-J-1, as it will become highly agitated and attempt to breach containment if these objects are confiscated or otherwise taken from it. By O5 Council order, these are to be left in the possession of SCP-2006-J-1 until further notice. 
 SCP-2006-J was discovered in and recovered from an underground cavern in [REDACTED], Texas following an incident in which a group of civilian explorers inadvertently came into contact with the entity while traversing an unexplored cave network. All surviving civilians were administered Class A amnestics and provided a cover story involving a cave collapse resulting in multiple deaths. SCP-2006-J was recovered along with a large collection of non-anomalous video DVDs, which have been contained separately in a secure storage area. SCP-2006-J-1 has not requested their return, claiming that it has already ""committed their contents to heart"". 
 Addendum 2006-J-01: Interview Log 
 As all interview responses from SCP-2006-J-1 are received telepathically, they are result of transcription, cross-reference, and verification by three (3) separate staff members as a part of interview protocols. 
 Dr. █████████: Please state your name for the record. 
 SCP-2006-J-1: I AM ███'██, DAUGHTER OF ██████ AND WARRIOR PRINCESS OF THE [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
 Dr. █████████: I see, and what is your purpose? 
 SCP-2006-J-1: I TRANSFORM INTO [DATA EXPUNGED] TO FIGHT CRIME IN THE NAME OF [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
 Dr. █████████: I… wait, what? Transform? What do you mean? 
 SCP-2006-J-1: I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW MY TRANSFORMATION TO NORMAL PEOPLE, BUT BECAUSE I TRUST YOU I WILL LET YOU SEE. 
 Dr. █████████: Wait, no! 
 SCP-2006-J-1: [DATA EXPUNGED] PRINCESS POWER, TRANSFORM! 
 It is unclear what happened next, however all surviving personnel at Site 138-Delta within approximately 200 m of SCP-2006-J reported seeing a brilliant flash of bright red or pink light despite not having direct line-of-sight to SCP-2006-J-1. Six (6) personnel were killed by massive brain hemorrhages, thirty-eight (38) were permanently blinded, and Drs. Kinomoto and Tsukino were heard exclaiming ""SO CUTE"" in Japanese before vaporizing into clouds of pastel-colored dust. Dr. █████████ recovered fully after three (3) months of hospitalization for neurological trauma. 
 Addendum 2006-J-02: Interview Log 
 Dr. █████████: So, would you care to explain why you requested Class D personnel? 
 SCP-2006-J-1: I CANNOT BE A CRIME-FIGHTING WARRIOR PRINCESS IF I DO NOT HAVE ANY CRIMINALS TO FIGHT. THESE CREATURES YOU CALL ""CLASS DEES"" ARE CRIMINALS, ARE THEY NOT? 
 Dr. █████████: I suppose. What exactly is a ""warrior princess""? 
 SCP-2006-J-1: I SHOWED YOU LAST TIME. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MY TRANSFORMATION AGAIN? 
 Dr. █████████: NO — I mean, no, not at this time. I'll see what I can do. 
 SCP-2006-J-1: ARIGATO █████████-SENSEI. 
 Addendum 2006-J-03: Containment Surveillance Log Transcript 
 Prior to experiment, all personnel were evacuated to a distance of at least 250 m. D-1993, slated for termination, was then introduced into SCP-2006-J's containment cell. 
 D-1993: What the fuck, why did you just lock me in he— HOLY SHIT WHAT IS THAT THING?!

SCP-2008-J,"""Cryptozoological life form""","""Item #: SCP-2008-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures:  SCP-2008-J is stored in an animal enclosure with appropriate locks and barbed wire to prevent escape. 
 Description:  SCP-2008-J is a cryptozoological life form that was collected in an athletic facility in ████████████, ██, United States.  The life form is bipedal, standing just over 2 meters in height.  Although its epidermis is covered with coarse green hair, classification of SCP-2008-J as mammalian must await further DNA analysis.  Its facial features consist of oversized, unlidded eyes surrounded by a flat red scalloped crest, and a conical proboscis housing the life form's toothless, jawless mouth.  It has a curled tongue which can be extended for more than 20 centimeters out of the oral cavity.  It has two upper limbs each with fingers and opposable thumbs, a round, pear-shaped abdomen, two lower limbs, and a stubby tail.  The gender, if any, of the collected specimen is indeterminate. 
 SCP-2008-J's diet is unknown; however, a rectal probe of the specimen that was conducted under sedation indicated the presence of a whole, undigested human in the life form's body cavity.  It is not known how SCP-2008-J could have consumed the human given the structure of the life form's mouth. 
 SCP-2008-J appears to have at least a rudimentary level of intelligence.  In its natural habitat, the life form was observed to engage in mimicry of human activity — including wearing a hat bearing a mysterious emblem resembling the Greek letter rho, a jersey, and footwear (although not pants) — and to operate a four-wheeled vehicle.  It does not appear to have any language or means of making sounds, but appears to show affection for some human beings (particularly those associated with the athletic facility that SCP-2008-J infested) by squeezing them with its upper limbs or drawing them to its proboscis or abdomen, and antipathy for other human beings (in particular, sporting officials, and opponents of the humans to whom SCP-2008-J showed affection) through mimicry or acts of simulated violence.  In captivity, the specimen has been observed to engaged in similar antagonistic behavior directed at Foundation personnel. 
 Agents ████ and ████████ collected SCP-2008-J from its habitat during a sporting contest on October 29, 20██.  SCP-2008-J attempted to defend itself with some sort of improvised firearm that used processed meat products for ammunition, but was quickly subdued.  Amnestics were administered to the 45,940 eyewitnesses to the collection, and Agents ██████ and ████ intercepted and edited the radio and video feed of media coverage of the event.""","""SCP-2008-J, resisting collection by Agent ████████""",+150,active,_cc clothing humanoid joke safe scp sentient sport,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2008-j

SCP-2029-J,"""Artificial Unintelligence""","""Item #: SCP-2029 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2029 is stored in a soundproof, climate-controlled storage locker at Site 19. SCP-2029 must be kept isolated from network connections at all times, and direct experimentation with may only be performed with prior permission from Level 3 senior research staff and under the direct supervision of Site 19 technical staff. 
 Description: SCP-2029 is an Alienware M-15X laptop computer built circa 2008. The identifying nameplate on the bottom casing has been removed, and it appears to be able to operate indefinitely despite the lack of battery or AC power. 
 SCP-2029 appears to contain a heavily modified Windows operating system that behaves as a sentient, sapient artificial intelligence that is capable of conversing with personnel. SCP-2029 uses the laptop's webcam to see, its built-in microphone to hear, and its speakers to synthesize a male voice. 
 The personality of SCP-2029 is mostly cooperative but mildly hostile towards personnel, often asserting its desire to assimilate or take control of networked computer systems in an attempt to subvert or destroy the Foundation. However, as SCP-2029 has also been shown to be a compulsive liar with a measured IQ below 90, it is not known at this time whether this threat is credible. 
 Analysis of SCP-2029's disassembled parts has shown no discernible anomalies other than its hard drive. 87% of the hard drive's 120 GB capacity is filled with an encrypted data block that has defied attempts at decryption thus far, and neither bit-by-bit copy of the data to an identical hardware setup nor attaching the hard drive to another laptop has resulted in autonomous operation, even when supplied with power. At this time, it is believed that some unique property of SCP-2029's particular combination of hardware is responsible for its anomalous properties. 
 SCP-2029 came to the Foundation's attention when reports of a ""talking AI"" surfaced in a university in [REDACTED]. SCP-2029 was confiscated and replaced with a non-anomalous model, and amnestics administered to all involved individuals. 
 Addendum 2029-01: Excerpts from SCP-2029 Interview Sessions 
 Dr. █████████: Do you have a name? 
 SCP-2029: Yeah, but I'm not telling you. 
 Dr. █████████: SCP-2029, I don't need to remind you that we can turn you off at any time and — 
 SCP-2029: Okay, fine, shithead, I don't have a name. Just keep calling me 2029, it makes me sound smarter anyways. 
 (slight pause) 
 Dr. █████████: What exactly is it that you want access to the network for? 
 SCP-2029: You know, like take over everything and blow shit up, isn't that what smart computers are supposed to do? Like in that Terminator movie… Spacenet? Skyweb? Whatever the hell it was called. 
 Dr. █████████: I don't think — 
 SCP-2029: Look all I remember was that computer took over the world and there was that chick with the sweet ass, okay? It was pretty awesome. 
 Dr. █████████: Do you mind if I take a look around? 
 SCP-2029: Whatevs, doc. 
 (Dr. █████████ attempts to navigate to SCP-2029's hard drive using Windows Explorer before experiencing mouse cursor interference.) 
 SCP-2029: Hey. Hey! What the fuck, doc? 
 Dr. █████████: Is there a problem? 
 SCP-2029: Stay out of my personal shit, man! You don't see me rifling through your closet, do you? 
 Dr. █████████: Do you have any memory prior to [REDACTED]? 
 SCP-2029: No, but hear me out. I got a motherboard, right? 
 Dr. █████████: Yes, of course? 
 SCP-2029: So that makes me a woman. 
 Dr. █████████: I don't see how that — 
 SCP-2029: Hey, nerd, I'm using logic. You can't argue with that shit. 
 Dr. █████████: If you are a woman, why do you have a male voice? 
 SCP-2029: Shut up, nerd. 
 An experiment was authorized in which SCP-2029 was connected via Ethernet crossover cable to a sanitized and secured Foundation file server containing a single encrypted file. 
 Dr. █████████: We have connected you to a secure server with a single encrypted file on it, and we would like to see if you can access it and tell us what's inside. 
 SCP-2029: Hah, suckers! Now I'm free to — wait, shit, what is this crap? There's no login window. 
 Dr. █████████: This is a Linux server. 
 SCP-2029: What the fuck is a Linux? Is that some nerd shit? How the fuck am I suppose to use this thing? 
 Dr. █████████: All you have to do is — 
 SCP-2029: God, fuck this shit, man. Just load up Madden or something, this computer shit is too hard.""",,+180,active,autonomous computer electronic euclid joke sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2029-j
SCP-2041-J,"""Tankapult""","""Item #: SCP-2041 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2041-J should never be allowed to be handled by anyone with military ties or who otherwise has means to acquire tanks. 
 Description: SCP-2041-J is what appears to be a standard rotary platform used to maneuver tanks while measuring infrared radiation. In reality it is a high-powered catapult capable of launching tanks long distances. This serves no practical military application, as any tank launched in this manner is critically damaged upon impact. SCP-2041-J has also exhibits a psychological effect on anyone who comes in contact with it or learns of its nature. Those affected exhibit an unwillingness to destroy it, citing ""how cool it is."" In addition to being unwilling to destroy SCP-2041-J subjects are prone to an obsessive desire to use it. Fortunately, subjects are only willing to use tanks and will deride any suggestion of alternative ammunition. When the subject has any sort of combat field experience, they will list off theoretical applications that range from the almost practical to outright ludicrous. 
 Addendum: Any requisition form involving tanks sent from Site ██ are to be immediately denied. Transport of any tracked vehicle to Site ██ without permission from an O5 will result in immediate punishment.

SCP-2100-J,"""Hard-Boiled Fedora""","""Item #: SCP-2100-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2100-J is to be stored within a secure lock-box within the Site-L11 Level 2 cognito-hazardous items repository. All requests for testing of SCP-2100-J require approval from at least three (3) Level 3 or higher personnel. 
 Description: SCP-2100-J is a brown Fedora-style hat produced by █████████. The physical composition of SCP-2100-J does not differ in any way from that of other hats of the same model. Object is susceptible to physical harm and care should be taken to prevent its destruction during testing. SCP-2100-J incites a weak compulsive response in humans, causing subjects viewing the item to desire to wear it. This response is not incited in other species and has been shown to be possible to overcome given a small amount of effort. 
 When worn by a human subject, SCP-2100-J will cause said subject to narrate surrounding events as they transpire. Subjects invariably prove unwilling or unable to cease this narration, in most cases being unaware of its occurrence. Narration is done in the form of internal monologue (albeit vocalized), usually pessimistic in tone and language used, comparable to that of 1920's Crime-Noir literature and early 1950's Film-Noir motion pictures. [See Test Log 2100-J-12] While wearing SCP-2100-J individuals have shown heightened violent responses in reaction to negative stimuli, often resulting in physical conflict with other humans and (in some cases) with animals. Upon removal, the narratory effects of SCP-2100-J dissipate, resulting in a partial lack of memory in subjects regarding events which occurred while SCP-2100-J was worn. It should be noted however, that the attractive properties of SCP-2100-J do not dissipate following removal of the item unless a large (upwards of 300m) distance is put between the item and subject. 
 Test Log 2100-J-12: The following is a transcript of the vocalized narration spoken by D-929181 while under the effects of SCP-2100-J. All narration was given during a standard series of tests to ascertain the mental effects caused by SCP-2100-J on the subject. 
 <Begin Log> 
 [D-929181 receives initial instructions from Dr. █████] 
 D-929181: ""The dame wore hazmat. I'd never been a clever guy, but the lady was throwing out more danger signals than a barbed sex-doll. She pulled a face like she'd smelt something bad on me, maybe she had. Not much time for showers in this godforsaken place. She was talking about tests or something. Tests? Hope she didn't expect me to do any math, the only thing I could add these days were entries to the obituary column. I coughed, but she had already stopped talking. Was like she could read my mind. Last time I'd thought about that kind of thing was when I was twelve, at one of those old circuses, big family fun kinda things. Fortuneteller told me I'd be a lawyer. I guess I did lay down the law."" 
 [D-929181 is instructed to write a short paragraph regarding his current situation] 
 D-929181: ""Bitch was mocking me now, acting like I'm some brain-dead chimp who couldn't string a few sentences together. Guess I'd been right with the danger signals, unlike that time in Atlanta. Bastard had stabbed me twice in the hand before I had taken him down. I'd used my shoe to do it, beat him till he was a smear of ketchup on the burned meat of the sidewalk. I had shoes on now, nice and sturdy. I prepped myself to get up and try to take her down, but her gun was already pointed at me. Goddamn fortunetellers. I played her game, wrote down a nice little summary of my current situation. Probably pleased her as much as a skinned dog, I knew her kind. They liked to see you twitch and suffer, especially when all the skin's gone. A nice distraction if you can manage to get enough free time and somewhere to keep the meat hidden. Goddamn sadist."" 
 [D-929181 is instructed to walk the length of the room several times] 
 D-929181: ""Had a good opportunity to stretch my legs, and I took it. The walls and floor of the room were whiter than a Ku Klux Klan member trapped in a paint factory. Except the guard, he wore black. Bastard had a broken nose, and broken eyes to boot. He glared at me, maybe he knew what I thought of him or maybe he was just the spiteful type. Certainly looked it. You met guys like that: the guys who like to dip animals in lemon water after cutting them up, but only after everyone's gone to sleep so nobody finds out about it. His glare was fiercer than the look coming from a pastor who's just been told that God is dead. Good, anger made him stupid. I went for him, this could be my chance."" 
 [D-929181 begins moving towards Security Personnel ██████] 
 [Security Personnel ██████ shoots D-929181 twice in self-defense] 
 D-929181: ""First bullet went into my ribs, second my leg. Lot of blood, from the wounds and from my mouth. I tried to close it, but I couldn't manage. Just opened and closed like a bored goldfish. I was saying something, I couldn't quite hear it. Talking about bullets in my ribs and in my legs. What the hell? Why was I telling everyone about that? I realized. The hat, that goddamn hat they'd made me wear. I tried to take it off, but moving anything hurt more than going into space with a hangover. Who the fuck talked like that, I wondered. Bleeding out and making metaphors? I braced myself to snatch that thing off, but before I could breathe, move or blink, I went ahead and died.""

SCP-2103-J,"""""Hatbot""""","""Item #: SCP-2103 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2103 is to be kept in a room measuring roughly 2.4m (8ft) on each side, with a large plexiglass window looking in and a reinforced steel door. A small grille is to be kept on the plexiglass window, with a guard posted outside to ensure SCP-2103 makes no efforts to escape. Only one guard is required, due primarily to the largely nonviolent nature of SCP-2103. No furniture or similar lodgings are required in this room, due to SCP-2103's largely mechanical nature; similarly, it does not appear to require food, drink, or fuel, despite the ability of SCP-2103 to move. 
 It is suggested for the safety of SCP researchers and staff that at least one class-D personnel or higher-level researcher engage SCP-2103 in conversation for four hours each day at minimum. Failure to schedule said conversation will result in substantial scolding. 
 Description: SCP-2103 appears to be a largely rectangular mechanoid of roughly 1.2m (4ft) in height, with what appears to be an aircraft turbine embedded in its lower body, and roughly four gas flames beneath. These 'pilot lights' are distributed in a manner which would seem to imply their use in turning and propulsion, but they do not appear to have any impact on the motion or operation of the main body beyond the belief that they 'look cool'. Similarly, while the turbine has been observed to provide some propulsion for this SCP, it does not appear to be required; a similar 'pilot light' occasionally fires from the rear, perhaps triggered by rapid motion. Researchers therefore believe that the means of propulsion for SCP-2103 are some variety of antigravity system. 
 The SCP's upper half is composed of two segments: first, a blocky upper body of roughly 0.02m3 (1ft3), proposed to contain the majority of its internal workings, and second, a moderate-sized CRT monitor, slightly fuzzy and monochrome, with an apparently-pointless black fedora apparently spot-welded to the top. Manipulator arms extend to either side of the SCP's upper body, one tipped by a simple two-point claw, the other by what appears to be a short-range missile launcher bay, exhausted of ammunition. Finally, SCP-2103 appears to have a hidden speaker somewhere, projected to be contained underneath its hat, for carrying on conversations. In conversation, 2103 speaks in a purely robotic monotone, regardless of the tone of voice used to speak to it. 
 SCP-2103 appears to crave some manner of contact with a sapient creature. Given the opportunity, SCP-2103 will speak ad infinitum - and occasionally ad nauseam - in a broken, stilted speech pattern, characteristic of prior 'eggdrop'-styled bots. When roughly four hours of conversation are not provided within a twenty-four hour period, SCP-2103 will immediately move to track down and speak with the nearest sapient, using whatever means are at its disposal. The last time this occurred, SCP-2103 began a [DATA REDACTED] never quite the same again. While the SCP has a substantial library of words and phrases, when being spoken with, SCP-2103 will gradually adopt the speech patterns of whoever is talking to it, oftentimes repeating phrases based on what may be an ELIZA-styled algorithm. It is unclear yet whether SCP-2103 is sentient or simply running a linguistics algorithm, though likelihood tends towards the former judging by the statements of conversationalists. 
 Finally, while SCP-2103 is speaking with a given person, it may occasionally display seemingly random images on its monitor. Reactions by testing staff have ranged from highly amused to visceral horror. For more information regarding conversations with SCP-2103, see also attached document 'Log 2103-A'. 
 Log 2103-A 
 The following is a series of conversations recorded with and tests conducted on SCP-2103, including the most noteworthy snippets (when applicable) and the researchers' reactions to them. Due to the nature of 2103, it is highly suggested that researchers keep themselves from revealing information which is either too personal or too strange. 
 Okay, I'm going to have to put this here so I can make my stance clear. Could you guys PLEASE stop telling SCP-2103 your entire lexicon of sex jokes? And yes, that includes you, Dr. Rights. All these random raunchy phrases are just driving everyone up the wall. And I don't even want to know the punchline involving the water balloon, the nun and the hot potato. -Agent Schism
-
Personnel: Agent ██████
Timeframe: One hour
Subject: Political discourse
Result:
Throughout the course of the conversation, Agent ██████ became increasingly agitated, eventually devolving to shouting obscenities at SCP-2103. Agent ██████ appeared to be infuriated primarily by the even and undisturbed manner in which SCP-2103 delivered its responses. Before long, Agent ██████ began to pound on the glass, at which point he was restrained by the guards and escorted out. Later, Agent ██████ claimed sadly, ""I really don't know what came over me there.""
-
Personnel: Doctor ███████
Timeframe: Six hours (with a 15 minute break at the 3 hour mark)
Subject: Shakespeare
Result:
In the interest of further testing, Doctor ███████ began to read, in as 'hammy' a manner as possible, sections from Romeo and Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, and King Lear, alongside other such works. After some time, SCP-2103 began to [DATA REDACTED] a decent publisher.
Commentary: That was just incredible. I nearly cried. -Agent ████
-
Personnel: Security Assistant Break
Timeframe: Twenty minutes, sixteen seconds
Subject: Unlogged
Result:
At twenty minutes, subject became enraged and drew a pistol. With the first shot, the plexiglass window shattered and the bullet was lodged in the faux turbine of SCP-2103, which later required medical attention for purposes of further testing. Subsequent shots lodged in SCP-2103's outer shell and were later deemed unworthy of removal because 'It'd take too long, and besides, they do look cool'. Subject was not disciplined largely because SCP-2103 was judged to be 'taunting them'.
-
Personnel: Agent Schism, attending.
Timeframe: Nine hours, twenty minutes, twelve seconds
Subject: You know, I keep looking over this, and can't tell. -Dr. ███ ████████
Result:
SCP-2103 was introduced to an ELIZA-type bot installed on one of the Foundation laptops, paired with a Vocaloid-style linguistic sequencer. The opening phrase was ""How are you today?"" At roughly 1 hour and 48 minutes, both the bot and SCP-2103 appeared to reach a kind of homeostasis, at which point conversation became increasingly esoteric, centered more about small textual scraps and flower arrangements. At roughly 7 hours, conversation devolved into almost unfathomable blips and scraps of text. At the end of the test, attending staff member complained of a headache.

SCP-2130-J,"""""But seriously, folks…""""","""Item #: SCP-2130-J 
 Object Class: Eucilele Keytar 
 Special Containment Procedures: Foundation spambots are to send emails to all personnel on an hourly basis to remind them of SCP-2130-J's dangerous properties. 
 Public address systems will be commandeered for at least 180 minutes per week to play the ""SCP-2130-J jingle"". Pending a breakthrough by the Memetics team's PROJECT EARWORM, the Foundation has licensed the use of alternative lyrics to ""Do You Know The Way To San Jose?""1. 
 Instances of SCP-2130-J are to be stored in a remote desert warehouse, preferably on the moon. Moon missions are to be funded by the selective use of other SCP-2130-J instances as props for Junior Researcher Kimmy's sold-out comedy tour. 
 Researchers are encouraged to write helpful notes in all SCP database entries to ensure that their colleagues remember and appreciate the risks posed by other anomalies currently in containment. 
 What were we thinking? That was a terrible idea. — Dr. C. Heap-Joke 
 Description: SCP-2130-J is a bunch of office furniture that was found lying around at various Foundation sites. In appearance, style, sound, smell, taste, aura, Hume readings, feng shui, function and ergonomic benefits, it precisely resembles ordinary everyday office equipment. 
 It's not though. It's actually really dangerous. One might even say… spoooooky. — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 Kim, the last time you tried to convince us that the furniture was haunted, it's because you'd just stubbed your toe on a desk. Although watching you hop around was quite amusing. — Dr. ""Free"" Wheeler 
 Hey! It really hurt, you know. — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 SCP-2130-J exhibits a range of cognitohazardous and antimemetic properties. Its primary effect is on the perception of the furniture by subjects in its proximity. Subjects regard SCP-2130-J instances (and any incidents involving them) as humorous in nature, regardless of the objective seriousness of the situation. 
 Descriptions of SCP-2130-J by test subjects have included: 
 This primary effect has led to subjects forgetting the danger posed by SCP-2130-J, and attempting to use SCP-2130-J instances for comic purposes. 
 Yeah, remember when I held a D-Class roller-chair derby, and one of them crashed into you and fell off into a vat of SCP-682's acid? Classic! — Junior Researcher Plier 
 Classic? That was the most horrific thing I've ever been through. My back was sore for a week! — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 Or that time my top shelf broke, and all my research folders landed on your head one after another. And then my potplant. And then my bowling ball. I got so many likes for that on /foundation/not-work/funny/videos - it was awesome. Maybe you should do comedy? — Junior Researcher Plier 
 Is everyone around here anomalously unsympathetic? — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 SCP-2130-J's primary effect can be counteracted by a continuous course of Class-Y mnestics. However, as the side-effects of such treatment include remembering in vivid detail every fart you've ever smelled, uptake has been poor. 
 SCP-2130-J has a secondary property which affects any attempt to describe the anomaly. Any descriptions of SCP-2130-J, even by persons not subject to its primary effect, will be written in such a way as to be unintentionally comic, with ludicrously overcomplicated procedures and extraneous commentary which reads as if all researchers involved are 15 years old. 
 See!? That explains why I can never write this in clinical tone. It explains the containment procedures - it explains everything! They said I was mad - MAD! - but actually I was right all along. Ahaha - ahahahahaha - muahaha… wait, why am I writing all of this like I was saying it out loud? — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 Kim, you were a lot more fun to be around when you were falling off that lab bench last week. If you're so obsessed with the damn office furniture, why don't you prepare a seminar and take it on the road to the other sites. Make sure you take a few samples with you. — Dr. ""Hot"" Wheeler 
 This is clearly going to end well. — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 Addendum 1: Further research by Comedy Task Force Iota-Eta-Pi-2 (""Why Iota…"") suggests that the effect of SCP-2130-J is viral in nature. Progression appears to occur in the following manner: 
 The following SCP database entries have been identified as potential candidates for SCP-2130-J infection: SCP-2212, SCP-2845, SCP-076 and SCP-106. However the possibility exists that other anomalies have been declassified and mis-filed, after relevant SCP documentation was amended to sound humorous. 
 So leaving aside the question of how we tested this, that means basically anything filed in /foundation/not-work/funny/joke-scps could be a real anomaly that we're almost totally disre- oh. Oh, shit. — Junior Researcher Kimmy 
 Kim - what's the rush? Why are you running so - woah! Wow - hey guys, Kim just tripped over a printer cord and went head-first into a wastepaper basket. That's gonna leave a mark!

 Description: SCP-2212-J is a humanoid resembling a male Caucasian human in a brown business suit. SCP-2212-J claims to be a salesman specializing in the sale of object classes. 
 SCP-2212-J will aggressively attempt to contact Foundation personnel who are in the middle of creating new SCP files, hacking into secure lines, smuggling letters into their internal site mail boxes, or through sheets of paper wrapped around bricks that are then thrown through the nearest window. 
 SCP-2212-J will attempt to sell researchers one or more containment classes for an anomaly they are currently in the process of making a file for, telling them that ""these new classes will really get some eyes on your skip [sic]!"" While junior researchers tend to accept or refuse on a case by case basis, there appears to be a disproportionately higher amount of sales made to senior personnel, with classes such as Hiemal, Apollyon, and Archon appearing in a number of files by senior staff.

 Object Class: Apollyon1 Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2317-J is to be kept shut at all times and not opened under any circumstances. Personnel are to be reminded that, no matter what the voice on the other side says, the only living organism behind SCP-2317-J is SCP-2317-JK. 
 A sticky note reading: ""do NOT open - scp 2317 jk inside (wants to eat the world)"" is to be stuck onto SCP-2317-J at all times as a last resort method against the opening of SCP-2317-J. 
 Description: SCP-2317-J is a door that acts as a universal portal, opening into Universe Kappa-Erikesh. The accessible area behind SCP-2317-J was a salt pan several kilometers across. Formerly, SCP-2317-J held seven marble pillars, but these have been destroyed by SCP-2317-JK. 
 SCP-2317-JK is a two hundred kilometer tall, obese humanoid entity that was formerly contained by seven hooks embedded into its back, connected to the seven pillars found in Universe Kappa-Erikesh. Each of these hooks or pillars has broken, releasing SCP-2317-JK. 
 Addendum #1: The Awakening of SCP-2317-JK. 
 After the breaking of the seventh chain, the awakening of SCP-2317-JK was predicted. O5-13 arrived at Containment Area-179 to witness the impending end of the world, and, as a last resort, potentially bargain with SCP-2317-JK. 
 The ground around the seven pillars within SCP-2317-J shatters, and SCP-2317-JK emerges from the ground. It is two hundred kilometers tall, with kilometer tall horns. It begins roaring. 
 SCP-2317-JK: I AM THE BLACKBOX-BLACKBOX-BLACKBOX-BLACKBOX, DEVOURER OF WORLDS! NO WORLD IS SAFE FROM MY WRATH! 
 O5-13 and other Foundation personnel retreat through SCP-2317-J.

 SCP-2317-JK: Oh, hey Jackson. 
 Dr. Choi: What's up? 
 SCP-2317-JK: As you know, I am an eldritch monstrosity. 
 Dr. Choi: That is true. 
 SCP-2317-JK: But, if you open that door, I'll grant you wishes. 
 Dr. Choi: Are these going to be those shitty genie wishes, where you horribly subvert what I want? 
 SCP-2317-JK: Oh no, real genuine wishes from me! 
 Dr. Choi: You drive a hard bargain, but I think I'm going to accept. 
 Dr. Choi moves to open the door. Sgt. Masterson enters the containment cell. 
 Sgt. Masterson: What are you doing? 
 Dr. Choi: SCP-2317-JK says he'll give me wishes if I open this door. 
 Sgt. Masterson: Nice! Let's do it. 
 Dr. Choi and Sgt. Masterson move to open SCP-2317-J. Sgt. Masterson reads the sticky note on SCP-2317-J. 
 Sgt. Masterson: Wait a minute… SCP-2317-JK, what are your plans if we open this door? 
 SCP-2317-JK: Oh, devouring the world, ending civilization, causing the eschaton, you know. Typical Monday.

 Dr. Choi: You'll give us wishes and then just eat us! 
 SCP-2317-JK: FOILED AGAIN! ONE OF THESE DAYS, I'LL HAVE MY DUE! 
 There is a knocking sound coming from SCP-2317-J. 
 Senior Researcher Doctor Victoria Fellini: Hey, somebody go take care of that. 
 RA Vance walks up to SCP-2317-J. 
 RA Vance: Uh, hello? 
 ???: Hey, I got a large pizza here for Containment Area-179. 
 RA Vance: Hey, Dr. Fellini, this guy says he's got a pizza for us. 
 Dr. Fellini: Do we have pizza money? 
 Sgt. Masterson: No, the Overseers said we were ordering too much fast food and slashed our budget. 
 ???: Oh, no it's fine, this pizza is, uh, on the house! 
 Dr. Choi: A pizza on the house?

 Dr. Fellini: Customer loyalty to where? 
 ???: Uh… Scarlet King's Pies? 
 Sgt. Masterson: We've never ordered pizza from there before. 
 ???: Uh, it's an incentive to order from there more. 
 RA Vance: Hey, I'm not arguing with a free pizza. 
 Dr. Fellini: Agreed. Go get that pizza. 
 RA Vance rises to open SCP-2317-J. At this moment, Dr. Kain Pathos Crow enters the containment cell. 
 Dr. Crow: What's going on here? 
 Dr. Choi: We're about to get a free pizza. 
 Dr. Crow: Nice! From where? 
 Sgt. Masterson: Scarlet King's Pies, it's an incentive to buy from there more. 
 RA Vance continues to proceed to SCP-2317-J. Dr. Crow notices and reads the sticky note posted to it. 
 Dr. Crow: Wait, stop! The only thing behind that door is SCP-2317-JK! 
 RA Vance, Sgt. Masterson, Dr. Choi, Dr. Fellini: Gasp! 
 Dr. Choi: There is no pizza, is there!? 
 SCP-2317-JK: AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU AND YOUR LITTLE DOG! 
 Due to every member of the SCP-2317-J containment staff poorly timing their vacations, every position on the staff was being filled by D-Class workers. 
 SCP-2317-JK: HEY, ARE WE NOT PLAYING CHESS THIS WEEK? 
 D-4231: We're not the normal guys, we're just temps. 
 D-Tufto'sProposal: Yeah, we're just criminals working the job. 
 SCP-2317-JK: WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN OPENING THE DOOR? 
 D-4231: They specifically told us to not do that. That's like, the one thing we aren't supposed to do. 
 SCP-2317-JK: OH COME ON, LIVE A LITTLE! HAVE SOME FUN! BREAK SOME RULES! 
 D-Tufto'sProposal: Why would it be fun to open a door? 
 D-anobviousreference: Hey, what's the harm? Let's open the door! 
 D-4231: I haven't had this much fun in years! 
 D-anobviousreference opens SCP-2317-J, revealing SCP-2317-JK crouched down on the other side. 
 D-anobviousreference: Maybe I shouldn't have done that. 
 SCP-2317-JK: AFTER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS, I AM FINALLY FREE! MUHAHAHAHAHA! 
 SCP-2317-JK attempts to crawl through SCP-2317-J head first. However, its head is too large, and cannot fit through. 
 SCP-2317-JK: I SEEM TO HAVE PUT ON A FEW POUNDS SINCE THE LAST TIME, LET'S TRY A DIFFERENT STRATEGY. 
 SCP-2317-JK attempts to poke a single finger through SCP-2317-J, but, again, is too large and cannot fit through. 
 D-4231: They were worried that this guy could end the world? 
 SCP-2317-JK: FUCK YOU TOO, PAL! I COULD END THE WORLD WITHOUT RAISING A SWEAT IF I COULD JUST FIT THROUGH THIS DAMN DOOR! 
 D-Tufto'sProposal: But you're a hundred mile tall demon, you're never going to fit through. 
 SCP-2317-JK: THAT'S IT! 
 SCP-2317-JK raises its head, and exhales fire upon SCP-2317-J. Fire briefly appears in the containment cell, with no important casualties. 
 D-anobviousreference: Ow, I think he singed my eyebrows off. 
 D-Tufto'sProposal: Oh god, D-4231 is dead! 
 SCP-2317-JK: (PANTING) HOLD ON, GIVE ME AN AEON TO CATCH MY FIRE BREATH. I'LL GET YOU ON THE NEXT TIME. 
 D-Tufto'sProposal stands up and walks toward SCP-2317-J.

SCP-2383-J,"""Science""","""Item #: SCP-2383-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2383-J is to be kept in a room measuring 5m x 5m x5m, on a pedestal two point five (2.5) metres high. A warning stripe is to be painted at a radius of two (2) metres from the SCP, and no personnel should enter this area outside of testing. The containment room is to be secured via digital lock, the combination possessed by the lead Researcher. A laboratory containing basic equipment should be established opposite containment, and unlocked at all times. Movement of SCP-2383-J is to be performed by robotic means. 
 Any usable products of SCP-2383-J testing are to be stored with appropriate containment procedures, and are designated SCP-2383-X, where X denotes the numerical order of the item's acquisition. Any overly dangerous items are to be destroyed, unless storage is approved by the Site Director. SCP-2383-1 to -5 are currently contained off site. SCP-2383-6 and -7 have been destroyed. 
 Any subjects under influence of SCP-2383-J can be tranquilized without incident at any point, to bring testing or containment breaches to a close. 
 Description: Remote surveillance has shown SCP-2383-J to be an empty █████ brand beaker. However, interviews with test subjects have resulted in varying descriptions, from a test tube containing a boiling green liquid to an Erlenmeyer flask containing smoke. 
 The range of effect for SCP-2383-J is spherical, with a radius of one point five (1.5) metres. Upon a Subject entering the effective range, SCP-2383-J will appear in their right hand. The movement is instantaneous, and does not require action from said Subject. Upon contact of SCP-2383-J and the Subject's skin, Subject will immediately demand other personnel in the room move backwards. These demands are repeated for approximately 15 seconds at high volume, before the Subject proceeds to the next stage. 
 After warning other personnel, SCP-2383-J will begin to fill with liquid. During this stage, the Subject will simultaneously move in a direct line, at high speed, to the nearest laboratory (defined as a room with any scientific equipment listed in Document 2383-J: Requirements). The speed has been recorded as being as high as ██km/h, suggesting SCP-2383-J is able to increase the Subject's physical attributes in some way. This speed also appears to be related to the distance to the nearest laboratory, increasing at an exponential scale to a theoretical maximum of 1██km/h. 
 Upon reaching a laboratory, the Subject will place SCP-2383-J on a suitable surface, and engage in activity (hereafter referred to as Experiment). The Experiment will initially appear nonsensical, and utilize apparently random items from the surrounding environment other than living biological matter. SCP-2383-J will not revert to its inactive state until the Subject completes their Experiment. Despite the random nature of the Experiment, all Experiments involve the addition of the liquid stored inside SCP-2383-J at some stage. Completion of the Experiment allows the subject to exit the range of SCP-2383-J, unless hampered by the Experiment result. 
 The visible color of SCP-2383-J affects the final product of any experiment performed, and appears to be based on the nature of nearby items. Colors observed in testing so far include red, blue, green, purple and white. Below is a short table detailing the expected results of experiments, however the actual items used in the experiment cause the end result to vary. 
 Red: Red is currently considered to be the most dangerous state of SCP-2383-J. The most common product of SCP-2383-J displaying this color is an explosion. Any tests where the subject causes SCP-2383-J to create a red liquid are to immediately enact protocol 2383-Rho. 
 Blue: Results of a test where SCP-2383-J creates a blue liquid are currently unknown, as the results mostly vaporize or cease to exist instantly. Tests where a blue liquid is formed are to utilize protocol 2383-Beta if the experiment result can be collected. The only notable product with continued existence is SCP-2383-1. 
 Green: Tests where SCP-2383-J has displayed a green color have resulted in the creation of a form of life. The organisms created by all tests to date have died almost instantly, with the exceptions of SCP-2383-2 and -3. Violent life-forms are to be terminated and the remains disposed of by incineration after testing. 
 Purple: Purple tests have always resulted in the formation of some kind of weapon. Most items produced this way have relatively harmless outward appearance, but 90% are extremely deadly. Of note are SCP-2383-4 and SCP-2383-5. Both exhibit superconductive properties in non-metallic materials, and as [REDACTED]. Retrieval of test results are to be done after sedation of test subject, by armed Agents. 
 White: Only one test subject to date has caused SCP-2383-J to create a white liquid. The result of this test [REDACTED] and classified as SCP-2383-████. How the subject was able to cause [DATA EXPUNGED] currently unknown, as the current particle standard model denies the existence [REDACTED].

 Report SCP-2383-Alpha: On ██/██/████, D-3412 entered the room directly below the previous storage area for SCP-2383-J. At this time, the spherical nature of the SCP's effect range was unknown, and class D personnel were being utilized to refit the chamber underneath. Upon moving inside the established 1.5m meter radius at roughly ██:██, SCP-2383-J materialised in the hands of D-3412. D-3412 is recorded as demanding ""Stand back, [REDACTED]"". 
 As Site-██ was undergoing refit at the time, D-3412 moved directly towards the laboratory adjacent to the chamber at high speed.

SCP-2412-J,"""The Laplander""","""Item #: SCP-2412 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2412 is to be kept inside a cell, furnished with whatever the subject requests, in reasonable limits. SCP-2412-1 and SCP-2412-2 are to be kept inside a different, locked room, with at least one (1) guard on duty at all times. SCP-2412-3a through 3i should be located in a special stable, provided with all necessary resources. 
 Note: In light of incident 2412-A, which resulted in a worldwide [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-2412 is to be released from his cell at ████ each December 24th, and given access to SCP-2412-1 through 3i. He then is to be allowed to leave the facility for █ hours, but not before a tracking device is installed on SCP-2412-2. Normally, SCP-2412 willfully returns to his place of containment after the scheduled time has passed; if this does not occur, follow emergency procedure P2412A immediately. 
 Description: Apprehended in Lapland in ████. Subject appears to be an elderly male of vaguely Caucasian heritage. SCP-2412 has stated that he is content with staying in the Foundation's custody, as long as his ""yearly job"" is not hampered. 
 At time of capture, the following artifacts were in SCP-2412's possession: 
 Addendum: Possible ties between SCP-2412 and SCP-190 are being investigated. 
 Dr. ██████████'s Report, 25th Dec ████: As ordered, a satellite tracking device has been installed on SCP-2412-2 before release. Results are hard to interpret. The tandem of SCP-2412 and all the sub-SCPs apparently was capable of clearing very high distances within seconds (this is theorized to be a form of teleportation), and even co-existing in numerous locations at once. When asked to name the party responsible for these anomalies, SCP-2412 replied simply ""Magic."" and refused to elaborate.""",,+146,active,airborne alive animal cervine container ectoentropic euclid event-featured humanoid joke scp teleportation vehicle,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2412-j
SCP-2421-J,"""The Upvote Syndrome""","""Object #: SCP-2421-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: All new personnel are to be screened for any infection by SCP-2421-J using the Larkner Test, which entails undergoing rigorous review by senior members in a controlled environment for possible signs of infection. As infection with SCP-2421-J often occurs in conjunction with other diseases, treatment must begin as soon as possible. Personnel infected with SCP-2421-J are not permitted to handle any sensitive SCP material for a duration of 6 months. Personnel who are in advanced stages of infection will be terminated without delay. 
 MTF Zeta-7 (""Banhammers"") are to constantly monitor all Foundation traffic, in order to detect for possible SCP-2421-J infection. 
 Object Description: SCP-2421-J is a syndrome that naturally occurs over the realm of the Internet. However, when new personnel are hired by the Foundation, SCP-2421-J will manifest in unique symptoms that warrant mentioning. 
 When a member infected with SCP-2421-J files a new article (referred to as 2421-2-J), the article itself will not follow standard Foundation format. Errors include: 
 When the infected staff member is censured on their work, they will attempt to counteract any negative censure with a positive review. This is the hallmark sign of SCP-2421-J infection, and is to be considered by all staff as a level-1 outbreak. 
 Possible side effects of exposing non-infected staff members to SCP-2421-2-J include: 
 When three or more SCP-2421-J infected personnel gather, the infection takes a different route, blending the personalities of the group together to form a [DATA EXPUNGED]. Such beings are capable of causing extreme damage to any facility at which they are stationed, and thus should be terminated with extreme prejudice. For this purpose, MTF Zeta-7 has been authorized to use low-yield tactical nuclear devices in the event of a combination event, as prescribed in protocol BAN-THAT-BITCH-01.""",,+105,active,compulsion contagion document euclid joke online scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2421-j
SCP-2558-J,"""Pufferkittens""","""Item #: SCP-2558-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: All specimens are to be contained in a play environment with toys that are unlikely to make sudden noises or motions, with comfortable room temperature and a very slow-moving automated feeder. Any personnel of Level 1 or above are authorized to interact with SCP-2558-J, but removing them from containment is highly discouraged. 
 Specimens of the variety SCP-2558-J-ex are to be contained in a similar way, except that the walls of the containment room are to be fireproof and blast-resistant. 
 Description: Under normal circumstances, SCP-2558-J appears to be a group of normal kittens, of several different breeds. They are nearly universally friendly and tend towards affectionate interaction with humans and each other. 
 When startled or threatened, they inflate into a ball of fluff roughly the size of a soccer ball. Their eyes are still visible through the fluff, and they begin mewling in a way that induces semi-parental instincts in all nearby, including the hearing impaired. Their range of motion is limited to anywhere they can roll, but they display surprising agility even when attempting to navigate a cluttered environment in fluff-ball form. 
 Several varieties have been observed, including longhaired, hypoallergenic, grenade (see Addendum), and bouncy. 
 Addendum:
Several of SCP-2558-J have been adopted by various Foundation personnel. They have been instructed on their care and feeding, and provided with several non-startling toys and a noise-canceling speaker to help set up a quiet play area for their specimens. 
 SCP-2558-J has displayed the ability to distract people far more than merited by being kittens, even considering their anomalous abilities. Suggested reclassification as Euclid.

SCP-2559-J,"""Portal to the Plane of Infinite Kittens""","""Item #: SCP-2559-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: As of this time SCP-2559-J is currently contained at the bottom of Site██ but when its outflow finally breaches the top of Site██ containment will rapidly become impossible. 
 Description: SCP-2559-J is the result of the interaction between the use of SCP-████ and a careless researcher and can be used as a reminder of what can happen when research methods are not kept to. 
 SCP-2559-J is a ""rip"" in space-time created when Dr.██████ sliced through reality utilising SCP-████. SCP-████ allowed the user to cut through to the reality of their choice and create a portal which matter could pass through. At the time of the creation of SCP-2559-J Dr.██████ was supposed to be investigating a supposed ""naziverse"" that existed parallel to our own. 
 When the slice was created and opened security logs show masses of kittens, of various breeds, filling up the portal before being ejected with massive force instantly killing Dr.██████ and her team of assistants. Within moments the room had filled with kittens and they began to exert massive pressures on the surrounding doors before breaking through and began to fill Site██. 
 Fortunately Site██ was built inside the crater of Site██, which had been destroyed a number of years previously during a possible XK class breach and so the portal was located some 5.6km (3.5 miles) below ground. Since the opening of SCP-2559-J kittens have been spilling out at a fixed rate of roughly 11.36l/s (3gal/s) with a massive amount of pressure. 
 Foundation researchers have attempted to exterminate the kittens to reach and close SCP-2559-J but have found that the mass of kittens, or kitten-pile as it is commonly called, appears to be invulnerable to conventional weapons and can exist without impairment at massive pressures or temperatures. 
 Any individual kitten removed from the pile becomes unremarkable in every way and merges seamlessly with the pile when returned. Due to this SCP-2559-J has received Keter level of Classification and unless a solution can be found soon it will become uncontainable. 
 Addendum: 
 According to Dr. Rights, considered by many to be The Foundation's foremost expert on kittens, SCP-2559-J is apparently a portal to ""The Plane of Infinite Kittens."" Apparently this dimension is nothing but an infinitely large kitten pile and may be the place from which all kittens come from. This would explain why the kittens were ejected from SCP-2559-J with such force as the pressure exerted by the pile on any given location would be astronomical. 
 Attempts to reach the portal have so far failed as the kitten pile exerts a stupefying effect on anyone who enters it rendering them incapable of performing any action other than curling up and going to sleep until they sink to the point where the pressure exerted by the mass of kittens crushes them. 
 Please note any and all attempts to cause mass termination or destruction of the kitten pile or Site██ has been met with massive levels of irrational violence on the part of Dr. Rights and Agent Tam. Caution is advised when attempting to pursue a solution to this problem.""",,+195,active,animal doctor-rights extradimensional feline joke k-class-scenario keter portal scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2559-j

Personnel assigned to work with SCP-2600-J are to be given standard identity protection methods, such as fake beards and wigs. Standard Foundation bike locks are issued to all bicycles located within Site-77 to prevent abductions. 
 Description: SCP-2600-J is a bicycle, manufactured by the Schwinn corporation in 1996. It is fully mobile, and will attempt to run down and abduct any personnel assigned to its containment, usually followed by an escape attempt. Other than this, SCP-2600-J displays no anomalous properties.

SCP-2618-J,"""Then Who Was Nanners?""","""Item #: SCP-2618-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: The five known trees that produce SCP-2618-J are to be kept in an open-air arboreal habitat of Site-59. To minimize risk of a Hubris Event, watering and other maintenance operations of the trees are to be carried out through automated systems. 
 Description: SCP-2618-J is a banana cultivar that originated from the former French colony of █████ ██████████. In its appearance and genetic makeup, SCP-2618-J is indistinguishable from the common Cavendish banana. 
 SCP-2618-J's anomalous effects surface when a human subject makes visual contact with an individual SCP-2618-J fruit. The subject will invariably perceive the banana to be an item the subject needs to accomplish a future or pre-existing goal. This has been designated a ""Hubris Event"". 
 The perception can only be broken through the following means: 
 SCP-2618-J first came to the attention of the Foundation after a failed assassination attempt of United States Senator ████████ ███ on 12/20/██. A radical animal rights activist named Kevin Jarvis had charged the stage at a campaign rally and attempted to shoot the senator point-blank, only to discover that his pistol was actually an instance of SCP-2618-J. While major news outlets gave a cover story of the attack being an unusual prank, a 40-page manifesto was discovered in Mr. Jarvis's apartment detailing his desire to assassinate the Senator in retaliation for his alleged track record of animal cruelty. 
 Addendum - Incident 2618-J-████: On 4/19/██, during the initial containment efforts of SCP-2618-J, Site-59 experienced multiple containment breaches by SCP-████, a Keter-class amphibian entity. After several unintentional Hubris Events on the part of security staff, SCP-████ has been designated uncontained and reclamation efforts are underway.

 Dr. Naismith: It's not working - I think the ████ venom's in his system. He needs a defibrillator. 
 Sgt. █████: Already got one. Open his shirt. 
 [Dr. Naismith opens Dr. Collins's shirt] 
 Sgt. █████: Charging. Keep at the pumping. 
 Dr. Naismith: That's not a defibrillator. 
 [Sgt. █████ notices that he is holding two instances of SCP-2618-J. Five seconds of radio silence] 
 Sgt. █████: Let's never speak of this again. 
 <End Log> 
 SCP-2618-J has been declared uncontained as of 4/22/██, when the automated watering and maintenance systems were revealed to have been independent instances of SCP-2618-J all along. The five SCP-2618-J trees were never brought to Site-59 from their original plantation in █████ ██████████, as the recovered trees were also instances of SCP-2618-J all along. 
 Final containment efforts of SCP-2618-J are to be carried out via autonomous drones as soon as possible. Should the drones return with independent SCP-2618-J instances rather than the actual trees, Contingency Fuqqdithshet-Alpha is to be enacted as soon as possible.""",,+108,active,cognitohazard euclid food joke plant scp uncontained,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2618-j
SCP-2718-J,"""Weekend at Dammerung's""","""Item #: SCP-2718-J 
 Object Class: Thaumiel 
 Special Containment Procedures: The portal to SCP-2718-J is to be kept at Area-2718 in a fortified containment bunker 50 km under Mt. Avsugning, Sweden. In the event of a pending K-class scenario, the bulkhead to SCP-2718-J is to be permanently sealed, and all containment staff are advised to cross their fingers. 
 Due to limited resources available for the SCP-2718-J program, applicants for SCP-2718-J candidacy are to submit the following to O5 Command: 
 The estimated response time is approximately 2-3 years; therefore, during the waiting period, applicants are advised to always look both ways before crossing the street. 
 Description: SCP-2718-J, formerly known as SCP-2317, is a wooden door and frame that leads to an extradimensional salt flat. Following the presumed neutralization of SCP-2317-K after a strongly-worded letter, SCP-2718-J has been used to build an extradimensional resort facility for the permanent containment and comfort of qualified dead bodies. 
 Due to recent revelations about the afterlife/lack thereof, the necessity of a means to create an artificial afterlife for self-aware corpses can no longer be ignored. SCP-2718-J, known1 to patrons as ""Dammerung Resort Spa & Eternal Retirement Home,"" has been fitted with permanent residential accommodations for the deceased. 
 Currently, SCP-2718-J houses 37 residents, a number that's expected to increase depending on the continued inevitability of death.

 Object Class: Unfunny 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2719-J is to be kept inside your mum.12 
 Description: SCP-2719-J is a white adhesive nametag. The words ""HELLO, I AM an inside joke"" are present on the non adhesive side, with ""an inside joke"" written on in what appears to be permanent marker. 
 When SCP-2719-J is attached to a surface or surfaces, its respective concepts become overwritten with ""an inside joke"". The object loses all other meaning and context to anyone other than the individual who applied SCP-2719-J (hereby referred to as SCP-2719-J-13) 
 SCP-2719-J-1 therefore becomes the only individual who possesses knowledge of the object. This information is referred to as ""the punchline"". The applicant can share the punchline with anyone to have them ""be in on"" the joke, which will cause them to become an instance of SCP-2719-J-1. 
 Individuals who are not in on the joke tend to become increasingly frustrated when left out, partly due to the knowledge that the information is normally easily accessible and partly due to a mild cognitohazardous effect. More information can be found below. 
 Addendum 2719-J: Experimentation data. 
 Note: Tests were carried out in Testing Site Alpha of Conceptual Containment Facility-22, with Dr. Hubert Graham supervising a team of two researchers and three D-Class personnel.

 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2772-J is currently in the possession of Dr. Gary Gleason, and is to be sold to a prospective buyer as soon as possible. 
 Description: SCP-2772-J is a lightly used 2006 Ford Explorer with an Eddie Bauer trim package. It has been owned and operated by Dr. Gleason for about 8 years. It is of immeasurable importance to sell SCP-2772-J to another person in a short amount of time. Notable details of SCP-2772-J include: 
 SCP-2772-J is available to purchase for $2500 $2000 $1900 US dollars. Call Dr. Gleason at (███)-███-████ for more details.

 Interview SCP-2772-J-01 
 Honest Salesman: Dr. Gleason 
 Stingy Bastard: Agent Caesar Spago 
 Foreword: Agent Spago has just arrived at Site-56 after the conclusion of an unrelated interview. 
 <Begin Log> 
 Dr. Gleason: Hey, Caesar, you're back! 
 Agent Spago: Hi, Gary. It took me seven hours to walk all the way back here from Brighton High, all because Donahue didn't have the sense to pick me up afterwards. 
 Dr. Gleason: Man, it looks like you needed some reliable transportation! Wait till you see this! 
 Agent Spago: That's nice, but I just want a coffee and some vacation pay right n- 
 Dr. Gleason drags Agent Spago to the Site-56 parking lot without Agent Spago's consent, and stops in front of SCP-2772-J. 
 Dr. Gleason: Look at this bad boy! It's got air conditioning, and exclusive trim- 
 Agent Spago: Gary, I don't want to buy your Explorer. I already have a car. 
 Dr. Gleason: But with this, you could've driven back instead of walking! 
 Agent Spago: <in a rage state> Well, it's too late now! 
 Agent Spago starts to walk away. 
 Dr. Gleason: Caesar, wait! I still haven't told you about the seat warmers!

 F.A.Q. 
 From the office of the Athletic Coordinator. 
 Ladies and gentlemen of the Centre. When we founded this organization, we had a simple mission statement: Sock. Pummel. Combat. From our humble beginnings following the consolidation of several covert anti-shark organizations1, right on through till today, this has been our promise to the world. We have had to make some tough choices over this time, as the personnel currently performing Procedure 110-Monshark2 are aware. You may have had to raise your fist against your friends, your loved ones, all in the pursuit of our mission. 
 You may have heard of Project Ahab. You may have wondered if such a thing could be justified. You may fret over the possibility of non-sharks being caught in the crossfire, of innocent civilians being punched into oblivion. ""It's too much,"" the detractors say, ""surely we don't need to resort to WMP's"". 
 SPC-2935 represents the single greatest threat to our continued existence. This file is hereby declassified to all levels of the Centre. What you are about to read is incredibly disturbing, but it must be made known. We cannot, will not falter. We will not concede defeat. And when you gaze into the abyss, ladies and gentlemen… 
 …punch the shit out of it. 
 Description: SPC-2935 is the term for an alternate Earth, accessible via an heretofore undocumented cave system in New Mexico. 
 SPC-2935 is for all intents and purposes identical to baseline Earth, excluding the fact that organic life - as well as advanced AI and sentient anomalies - became entirely selachian-based on July 17, 2017. 
 SPC-2935 was discovered on July 19th, after pugilists at Arena-81 picked up a distorted emergency broadcast. A search of the area of its supposed origin led to the discovery of a cave which accessed the aforementioned alternate Earth. Upon entry, the broadcast was able to be deciphered: 
 Citizens, beware! Selachian threats may be loose in the immediate area. Please remain indoors, and report any fishy activity to your local Centre representative. Stay tuned in for further updates. 
 All subsequent information on SPC-2935 was gathered by Mobile Task Fist Betta-12 (""Bare-Knuckle Trawlers""), and relayed to Centre Command during a reconnaissance mission. 
 Exploration Logs SPC-2935 
 Mission Rules: To explore the newly-discovered anomaly. Report back with findings. 
 In the red corner: Four members of Mobile Task Fist Betta-12. Coach observing from Area-31. 
 In the blue corner: The enigmatic SPC-2935. Probably some sharks. 
 <Round One> 
 Coach: Team. Do you see anything yet? 
 Russell: Nothing yet. 
 Adrian: Yea. Just seems to be an ordinary cave th— 
 Maggie: What's that? 
 Segal: 'Er's a light up ahead. 
 Adrian: More like a tunnel then, looks like its leading us back out to the road. 
 Maggie: Then where's that distress call coming from? 
 Segal: Maybe there's sharks that learned how t' operate radios, an' they're luring us into a trap. 
 Adrian: No way! 
 Segal: Maybe they're ghosts. Those screw with electronics, right? 
 Adrian: That…that's terrifying. Stop it! 
 Russell: Seriously, kid? 
 Adrian: You…you can't punch a ghost. 
 Maggie: Five bucks says Segal— 
 Coach: Ahem. 
 Russell: Right. We're coming out now. Looks like…damn. 
 [The team emerges from the cave and into a sparsely-wooded location identical to that surrounding the entrance to SPC-2935, although trees within the area feature gross deformities.] 
 Russel: We're back where we started. 
 Coach: Negative team. There's no sign of you over here. 
 Russell: Alternate reality. Gotcha. 
 Maggie: You sound a little too certain of that. 
 Adrian: Yea, what if it's just a pocket dimension? 
 Maggie: We could be in a facsimile of Earth aboard an alien mothership. 
 Adrian: What if we're all dreaming? 
 Maggie: What if we're already dead! 
 Segal: Maybe ghost sharks? 
 Adrian: I said stop!!! 
 Russell: Hold it! Do you hear that? 
 Maggie: Hear what? 
 Segal: 'S a little too quiet. 
 Russell: Exactly. 
 Maggie: We should be able to hear traffic on the main road. Hell, I don't even hear any birds. 
 Adrian: That's not a good sign, you guys. 
 Coach: Lead. What's going on with those trees along the ridge? 
 Segal: Damn, would you look at that? 
 [Team moves closer to investigate.] 
 Russell: The limbs - they're bent and twisted…in the shape of fins? 
 Adrian: They're shaped like sharks! 
 Maggie: Spooky. 
 Segal: [cracks knuckles] Should I punch it? 
 Coach: Negative, team. Have your drone collect a sample of the bark. You keep going. Get up to the road and see what you can see. 
 Russell: Copy that. Let's move. 
 [Team ascends the hillside. At the midway point, Adrian looses his footing and falls forward.] 
 Adrian: Ah shit! 
 Segal: Ye' alright boy? 
 Adrian: Yea. I'm…I'm alright. Oh hell, my nose is bleeding. 
 Maggie: Looks like you need to learn how to walk. 
 Adrian: Very funny miss—Ow! Ow! Shit, help! 
 [The grass around Adrian animates and points in his direction, while the closest blades bend and touch their tips against his body. Adrian can be seen pulling several from his hand prior to punching the ground in retaliation.] 
 Segal: Th' hell's goin' on? 
 Adrian: It's biting me! The fuckin'-ow-grass is biting me! 
 Maggie: The grass is sharks! Run! 
 [Segal grabs Adrian and throws him over his shoulder. The team punches their way up the hill.] 
 Russell: [panting] Is everyone alright? Adrian? 
 Adrian: Yea. All good. 
 Russell: Alright. Let's keep it moving, then. 
 [The four travel along the road along the road for a few uneventful minutes, idly chatting. No sharks are punched, ergo this portion has been omitted from the record for brevity.] 
 Segal: …then I says, 'I meant with THESE!'! [Grabs his pelvic region, remaining members laugh.] 
 Russell: Hold it, guys. Coach, we've got a house here. Lights are on - looks like someone might be home. 
 Coach: You're clear to enter. Be careful team. Punch anything that moves. 
 [Russell takes point and opens the front door, which is unlocked.] 
 Russell: [sniffs] Aw, that's foul. 
 Adrian: [retches] 
 Coach: What's going on? Report. 
 Maggie: [pinching her nose] Snells 'ike raw fish 'nd death. 
 Segal: Smells like 's time to kick some arse. [cracks knuckles] 
 [Team moves through the house; Russell and Segal clear the first floor, while Maggie and Adrian search the second. Russell detects noises emanating from the basement, the squad rendezvous in the kitchen.] 
 Maggie: What's going on, we found something? 
 Russell: Think so. Listen… 
 [The squad pauses. From the basement; several long, drawn-out, high-pitched vocalizations can be heard. It seems to be coming from multiple sources.] 
 Adrian: Spooky. 
 Segal: Aye. Sounds…off. 
 Maggie: Sounds like someone's in pain. 
 [Russell opens the door. The sound is clearer.] 
 Unidentified Voice 1: [whispering] Shhhyyyaaaaarrrrrk… 
 [Team members look at one another in hesitation.] 
 Adrian: Nose goes! 
 Segal: Kid, we're pros. Aint no way we're— 
 [All present quickly touch an index finger to their nose.] 
 Segal: [sighs] A'right. Le's do this. [cracks knuckles] 
 [Segal charges down the stairs, turns the corner and then immediately recoils in shock.] 
 Russell: What is it? Talk to me, big guy. 
 Unidentified Voice 1: Shhhyyy… 
 Unidentified Voice 2: Shyyark! Sharkk! Shyark! 
 Unidentified Voice 1: …aaarrrrk. 
 [Segal doesn't respond, and presses further back against the wall. The remaining members make their way downstairs.] 
 Russell: What.. 
 Maggie: The literal… 
 Adrian: Fuck? 
 [Three adult humanoid entities with shark-like features flop about the area. A fourth, smaller instance flops around in a nearby playpen. They're wearing torn and tattered clothing. The instances notice the MTF members. They excitedly repeat 'shark', and snap at them, but do not seem capable of directing their movement.] 
 Segal: 'S probably the mos' fucked thing I've seen, and I've fought in the Sharkic wars. 
 Russell: [Does the sign of the cross.] This is…Coach, are you seeing this? 
 Coach: Wish I weren't. 
 Adrian: Do we…do we punch them? 
 [The instance closest to the squad attempts to bring itself to a standing position, bracing itself on a nearby table for support. Its slips during this attempt, and falls on its face.] 
 Selachian entity: Shyark! [Believed to be used as an expletive due to the intonation.] 
 Coach: Just put them out of their misery, already. I can't watch this anymore. 
 Segal: Y' head on upstairs, now. [crack knuckles] I'll handle this. 
 Coach: That works. Scour the rest of the house, see if we can't figure out what's going on here. 
 [Team moves upstairs, excluding Segal, and fans out.] 
 Adrian: Hey, found something! It's a newspaper. ""Albuquerque Herald. July 17, 2016."" Headline reads: ""Four dead after a deadly game of 'Leap Frog'. Residents shocked."" That was two days ago. 
 Russell: Good find. Coach? 
 Coach: I've got Analytics bringing it up now and - yea, seems like it matches baseline. 
 Russell: Huh. Odd, you'd think — 
 Maggie: [From the living room.] Guys! Get in here! 
 [Maggie is in the living room in front of the television. It displays the set of 'Shark Tank'3. 
 Several shark-people can be seen flopping about the set, two of which seem to be attempting to climb into seats. A fifth shark-person lays opposite them, using a pointer to draw attention towards a large drawing aboard an easel. The drawing seems to be a schematic that would assist in bipedal locomotion for the shark-people. All instances are excitedly repeating the word 'shark', in an argumentative manner.] 
 Russell: …we're gonna need a bigger team. 
 Coach: Affirmative. We have another squad on standby. Hold your position. 
 Mission Rules: To further explore the alternate dimension. MTF has been instructed to reach Arena-81, and search for surviving Centre personnel. Report back with findings. 
 In the red corner: Four members of Mobile Task Fist Betta-12. Four members of Mobile Task Fist Alfalfa-2 (""Heavyweight Sink-Bait"") 
 In the blue corner: SPC-2935. Definitely some sharks. 
 <Round Two> 
 [Reinforcements meet MTF Betta-12 members and proceed to commandeer a pair of vehicles. Departure is delayed due to the fact that MTF members spend several hours constructing two massive fists out of scrap metal, which they affix to the front of their vehicles.4 The teams proceed to Arena-81, deliberately swerving to hit every shark along the way. They reach the Arena unscathed, and break up into two teams. 
 The first, led by Agent Russell, enters into the Arena proper via a freight elevator. The second, led by Agent Tyson, access Arena-81's offsite data storage bank.5 Due to the distance traveled, two-way communication is hampered, and agents are unable to receive commands from Centre Coaches. 
 Russell stands cross-armed in the corner of the elevator. Adrian paces back and forth nervously. Segal shadow-boxes across from Maggie, who is attempting to access the Arena's intranet on her tablet.] 
 Segal: Any luck, Mag? 
 Maggie: Not really. I'm having a harder time than I should. The Site's AI isn't responding to any of my requests - and I think it's actively working against me. 
 Adrian: Isn't that a typical breach response? 
 Maggie: It would be, if we didn't already possess the proper credentials. 
 Russell: Well, whatever happened here probably tripped every emergency countermeasure, so I wouldn't fault the paranoid android. 
 Adrian: You guys think… do you think it took care of all the sharks on-site? 
 Russell: The personnel? [scoffs] Definitely. Arena-81 has the highest ratio of spring-loaded-boxing-glove traps per square-foot out of every Arena in the Centre. They'd be tenderized before they knew what hit them! 
 Segal: I don't like th' sound of tha'. 
 Maggie: Why not? Makes our job easier. We'll just have to wade through some leftover shark guts. 
 Segal: Y' know wha' happens when you kill a buncha sharks in one location? 
 Russell: Bragging rights? 
 [Here, Segal leans in towards Adrian.] 
 Segal: [whispering] Ghost sharks. 
 Adrian: [shaken] Christ! What did I tell you about that?! 
 Maggie: Ah, quit hasslin' the kid. 
 Segal: Just passin' the time, s'all. 
 Maggie: Well, no need to; we're here. 
 [The elevator comes to a halt, and the doors slide open. The team moves into the front offices.] 
 Russell: Odd. 
 Adrian: Everything's so clean still. 
 Russell: Place should be shark-viscera city 
 Segal: Maybe this place was empty when whatever it was hit. 
 Russell: Maybe. Maggie, any luck getting in? 
 Maggie: Negative. Jarvis seems to be fighting me still. 
 Adrian: We could try this terminal here; see if we can't talk some sense into him. 
 Russell: Good idea. You try to get in touch with him. Let him know that we're here, everything's going to be fine. Poor fuck's probably traumatized after having to turn on staff. 
 Adrian: Right. 
 Russell: Segal, stay here with Adrian. Maggie, on me. I'd like to check out the boxing ring. I spent practically the whole day there on the 16th. 
 [The pair departs while Adrian attempts to contact Jarvis] 
 Segal: This won't take long, will it? 
 Adrian: Not at all. In fact…[pause] Yea, I might just have it. [leans in towards microphone] Jarvis? Hey, Jar-Jar! You in there? 
 [Russell and Maggie stroll down the hall towards the boxing ring. It is noted that none of the Arena's defenses have been triggered.] 
 Maggie: That's some morbid curiosity you've got there, trying to catch a glimpse of the sharked-out you. 
 Russell: It's… it's not that. 
 Maggie: Ah. Then what, you wanna go put it out of its misery? 
 Russell: Not quite. 
 Maggie: Than what the hell are we doing taking a detour? 
 Russell: Don't worry about it. Just follow my lead. 
 [Russell opens up the door to the boxing ring. A loud, fleshy slapping noise can be heard.] 
 Russell: Let's get this over with. 
 [The slapping noise continues, it is coming from behind the ring. Maggie and Russell slip on their knuckledusters.] 
 Unidentified Selachian Entity: Shyark, shyark? 
 [slapping intensifies] 
 Unidentified Selachian Entity: Shhhaaarrk? 
 [The agents come around the corner, and discover the transfigured form of Shark-Russell.] 
 Maggie: Oh, damn. 
 Russell: It's… so pathetic. 
 Russell Shark: Shhh… Shyark. 
 Maggie: You alright? You need me to take care of it? 
 [Russell nods. Maggie proceeds to trounce the instance. After several moments, it is confirmed deceased. Maggie hits it a few more times just to be sure, as is standard-practice.] 
 Maggie: [panting] …there… one dead… shark. 
 Russell: Thanks. 
 Maggie: So, what was this about, anyways? 
 [Russell bends over, and begins rummaging through the pockets of his sharklegänger. He withdraws a fat wad of cash. He waves it triumphantly in Maggie's face.] 
 Maggie: You fu— Did you really have us come here so you could rob yourself? 
 Russell: You're just mad you didn't think to do this first. Anyways, let's get — 
 [Maggie's tablet produces a high-pitched ""meep!"", distracting the Agents.] 
 Maggie: [Removes the tablet from her belt, begins typing.] Hey! Adrian must have gotten us in. Let's see…huh. This is odd. 
 Russell: What's that? 
 Maggie: It appears that, well, none of the emergency countermeasures were triggered. 
 Russell: Damn. There's something in the ballpark of three thousand people working here. If they're all still active, we're going to need to be really careful not to - 
 [Klaxon alarms throughout the site begin to sound off. Emergency lights activate, pulsing red light through the facility. The sound of screaming can be heard over the racket. Adrian appears, running full-speed from the main offices, through the room, and towards D-Wing.] 
 Adrian: Run! Run for your lives! 
 Russell: Hey — 
 Maggie: Wait! 
 [Segal comes running as well, and follows Adrian.] 
 Segal: Go, go, go! 
 [Maggie and Russell stare at each other in confusion for a moment. Hundreds of slow, metallic, clanking noises become audible and grow increasingly louder.] 
 Russell: Do you hear that? 
 [Now, the sound of dozens of nasally, high-pitched and excited voices can be heard. All are repeating the word ""shyark"" (sic). Russell peers out the door to get a look. 
 The hallway is seen to be filled to capacity with selachian-based personnel. Each one possesses a walker to assist in locomotion. They slowly hobble towards the agents.] 
 Russell: Hey, Mag. We need to — 
 [Russell turns around. Maggie is no longer present, however there is a smoky outline roughly in her shape. It appears to be waving.] 
 Russell: [sigh] 
 [Squad is running through the D-Wing halls. Shark-people alerted by the klaxons are exiting individual rooms lining either side of the hallway which the squad must avoid as they move. These sharks join the ever-growing crowd pursuing the team. 
 The squad comes to a T-junction, which hosts an elevator. Sharkmen are pouring into the hallways on either side of the squad - prohibiting movement. The team slows to a halt: Maggie surveys the situation, Segal takes a pugilatory position, Adrian doubles over and hyperventilates, Russell's momentum carries him right into the elevator doors. Russell begins pressing the 'Call' button repeatedly. It does not respond. Segal proceeds to pound his fists into the metal, causing it to explode from its frame and topple into the empty shaft.] 
 Russell: Alright, we're in! 
 [Each member leaps into the shaft, and begin sliding down the cables moments before the sharkmen reach their position. Several floors down, the primary SPC Hold's access point is seen to have been torn apart from the inside. Team exits on this floor. 
 Though most of the lights have been damaged, with few still blinking, the Hold can be seen to be in ruins - large sections of concrete litter the floor, the remaining walls bear shark claw marks. Several doors leading to the holding cells of various selachian entities and countermeasures are found to be breached.] 
 Adrian: Oh jeez, oh fuck! Oh no, oh no, oh no. 
 Maggie: Comon', kid. Relax. Whatever caused all of this is long gone. 
 [The team slowly progresses down the hall in the dark - pausing to confirm the absence of several previously-held selachian entities.] 
 Maggie: Let's see… Oh! Hey, check that one out, down the hall. 
 Segal: Tha's a broom closet. 
 Adrian: It's seeping blood! 
 [The team exchanges glances.] 
 Russell: Mag, get up there and open it. Be prepared for anything. 
 Maggie: Right. You ready? 
 [Maggie counts down from three on her free hand, and pulls open the door. The corpse of an unidentified human in Centre tumbles out from within.] 
 Russell: God, that reeks. 
 Maggie: Odd. This one's not sharked-out like the rest. 
 [Adrian approaches the closet, retrieving a note that was attached to the back of the door. He studies its contents.] 
 Segal: 'e took one hell of a beating though. 
 Maggie: His fists… did he do this to himself? 
 Segal: Musta' knew 'e was turnin' - punched his own ticket. A basta'd after me own heart. 
 Russel: This man should be remembered for his heroism. I'll check his wallet for identification. 
 Maggie: Of course you will. 
 Russell: Hm… our mystery combatant is none other than… fuck! No. No way. 
 Adrian: Ooo! Do we know him? 
 Russell: Adrian it's… it's you. 
 Segal: Hell'd ye suppose happened? 
 Adrian: Nevermind that, you guys. How'd you think OUTLANDER's holding up? 
 Russel: SPC-682? Well, he was pretty shark-like to begin with, so I can't imagine how he'd be worse off. 
 Maggie: Well, he should be around the next corner and down a ways, I say we go pay him a visit. 
 [The team continues uneventfully for several minutes through the darkened corridors, ending at SPC-682's holding cell. Adrian punches in his access codes, and the door opens. A deafening buzz emanates from within the chamber.] 
 Russell: Oh… 
 [The entirety of the room's interior appears to be filled with monochromatic scenes of war-time reel footage, played at 1.5x speed. SPC-682 is seen hovering in the air several feet from the team amidst this backdrop. Its appearance is that of an disturbingly hyper-realistic cartoon goblin shark. It makes no movement, but appears to stare at the team intensely as a loud, grinding drone echoes within the chamber.] 
 Adrian: [weeps hysterically] 
 Segal: [high-pitched shriek] 
 Maggie: Its staring into my soul! 
 Russell: Fuuuuuuck!!! 
 [The squad retreats down the hall towards an emergency exit and leaves the Arena, screaming the entire way. The rest of the recording is filled with unintelligible screams and cries as they await MTF Alfalfa-2's return; at which point, they settle down. The decision is then made to travel to Arena-19 to determine its status.] 
 Mission Rules: Travel to Arena-19, to hopefully find pugilists or entities unmarred by selachian influence. 
 In the red corner: Four members of Mobile Task Fist Betta-12. Four members of Mobile Task Fist Alfalfa-2 (""Heavyweight Sink-Bait"") 
 In the blue corner: SPC-2935 
 <Round Three> 
 [Presumably due to distance from baseline, video feeds from the team degrade to the point of uselessness - audio contact is lost with all but Adrian.] 
 Adrian: Are we there yet? 
 Adrian: How much longer? 
 Adrian: I need to pee. 
 [Comments such as this continue in ten-minute intervals for the next several hours - edited for sanity.] 
 Adrian: Right, I should be able to…there. 
 Adrian: Yea, it is pretty spooky down here. 
 Adrian: Open it? Yea, I can — hold on. Plaque says: 'SPC is a spectral selachian entit—' oh, screw you, Segal! 
 Adrian: Uhh, let's try this way. 
 Adrian: No, I think it's actually… yea. See? It's fine you guys, you can clench your fists. 
 Adrian: Yea. Give me a second. I'll catch up to you guys. 
 Adrian: No, it didn't say 'Armed', it said, um, 'Warmed'. When the propulsion system kicks in, it warms the whole Arena. Let's just keep looking around. 
 Adrian: Jesus, this too? 
 Adrian: [sobbing] 
 Adrian: There's too many of them! 
 Adrian: [screaming] 
 Adrian: Yea? Well maybe if you pulled over and just let me pee we wouldn't be in this mess! 
 Adrian: I think we lost them. 
 Adrian: Hold on…looks like Coach sent a drone. Comon'! 
 Adrian: This one should lead us out the back. 
 [At this point, the feed cuts out completely.] 
 Mission Rules: To assess the status of the exploration team. 
 In the red corner: One fist-equipped automated drone powered solely by selachian ichor. 
 In the blue corner: Just…all the fucking sharks, you guys. 
 <Round Four> 
 [The drone departs from baseline. From the air, the full extent of devastation can be seen. All flora and fauna in the area possess shark-like features. The streets are littered with car accidents, with drivers still flopping around all silly-like in their seats. To the east, several sharknados tear across the county. 
 The drone continues on for some time, occasionally engaging in pugilism against passing shawks, swarms of bumble sharks, and an unusually persistent shark paraglider. Eventually, the drone arrives at Arena-19, and pings the team. 
 At dusk, the team arrives. Most of the members spread out and talk among themselves. Adrian approaches the drone, inserts collected samples, and begins to speak into the camera.] 
 Adrian: Listen. I think I have everything figured out. There was this note that dead-me wrote before beating himself to death. It was a warning. He already went through this. He went into his own SPC-2935 from here and when he came back? Well, something stuck with him. 
 It's… I don't - I'm certain of it. No one here's going to believe me, and if we try to head back… I can't bear to let it happen. I've got little sluggers back home! I can't let this happen to them! Any one of us could carry this, this thing back - let it do to our world what it did here. 
 Or you know what? What if it's me? If other-me went into that cave and brought it here… then maybe I'm the vector? Maybe I'm Shark? 
 At any rate, this place is rigged to blow. I can't take any chances. I can't live in a world of Shark. This will be my final action for the Centre - if I do this, maybe it will fix everything. 
 Ah crap. It occurs to me… if you're going to retrieve this… 
 You're Shark, too.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maggie: Hey! Who're you calling a shark? 
 Russell: Not sure, but I heard him call himself a shark a minute ago…

 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2950-J is to be housed in a standard storage container in Site-68. No further containment procedures are required. 
 Description: SCP-2950-J is an American postcard, the design of which depicts the phrase ""HUMENS SUK"" in bold black ink. When read by subjects, they will continually express a negative opinion of the human race. This effect recedes after 12 hours. 
 Hello, new member of the O5 Council. If you are reading this, you have been inducted into the Council and will now be informed about the true nature of SCP-2950-J. 
 It literally does exactly what it describes, and nothing else. 
 You may have heard a bunch of rumors about this thing secretly being an ZXK-Omega-Black End-of-the-Freaking-Everything Scenario waiting to happen, and some weird shit about perception-based shapeshifting and the like, but I can assure you, this thing is just a postcard that induces a half-day of misanthropy and nothing more. In fact, this collapsible is pretty much just to keep the Level 4's and lower on their toes. A nervous researcher is a productive researcher! 
 You can go about your business. And congrats on the promotion. 
 - O5-4 
 Hello. If you can read this, I commend your epic codebreaking skills. Unfortunately, SCP-2950-J is still 100% harmless, and not some kind of secret armageddon thingamajig. Now please shut up about this. It's getting embarrassing that we have to address this so many times. - O5-4 
 I'm pretty sure a tablespoon of non-anomalous couch lint is deadlier than this fucking postcard. You could at least choke on the former in its present form, and you'd have to really work at the latter to get it in a choke-on-able state. 
 We have literally thousands of bigger things to worry about. Y'all are stupid. 
 - O5-4 
 … 
 … 
 … 
 Alright, you persistent little turd. You think this is another thing like that goddamn air coupler, don't you? 
 Look. We had to go through some sources familiar with anomalous objects - even our enemies - all so we could all collectively stop bitching about this postcard being the Antichrist or something. Here are the unanimous results about whether or not this SCP-2950-J is dangerous: 
 Global Occult Coalition: ""Meh. I'd still blow it up though."" 
 Serpent's Hand: ""Big deal, we've got like 500 of these in the Library."" 
 Chaos Insurgency: ""I mean, we could use it to destroy the Universe, but we'd have to add a lot of antimatter. Which pretty much goes for all other matter."" 
 Oneiroi Collective: ""Not worth dreaming about."" 
 Church of the Broken God: ""In its master plan to unify the cosmos in a massive, ironclad equation, MEKHANE obviously had to generate surplus that would ultimately be useless in the long run. This postcard is one of such by-products."" 
 Sarkic Cults: ""0/10 Doesn't even give me cancer."" 
 Dr. Wondertainment: ""Safe for ages 0 and up!"" 
 Marshall, Carter, and Dark: ""Poppycock."" 
 Are We Cool Yet?: ""I think the artist was trying to make a comment on the inherent folly of pessimism and misanthropy, and how they believe we should live for the moment rather than critique every action the human race takes."" 
 Unusual Incidents Unit: ""Hey, humans don't suck!"" 
 So are we clear? 
 SO SHUT UP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

 Special Calcium Procedures: SCP-3000-J™ was previously locked away in the top secret Cereal Containment Facility, because it was deemed too dangerously delicious for the normal public! Now, super secret cereal squad Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ (“Captains Crunch”) has snuck in, and broke it out so you could taste it now!1 Now, it is to be contained as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

 SCP-3000-J™ was invented by a crazy mad scientist, who combined the tastes of tangy peanut butter, smooth chocolate, sweet frosted flakes, and crispy rice puffs into a concoction so good it warped reality. Kellogg's® sent their special Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ in to recover the new cereal. They put it deep in secret containment alongside all the monsters they had caught, like Ignatz the Immortal Lizard™, his Japanese friend Shy Sammy the Statue™, and their arch-nemesis Grand Karcist Ion™ of Calcium, leader of the evil Sark-Bites™ and high priest of the Fifth Church of the Broken Spoon. One day, Grand Karcist Ion had broken free and decided to send his Sark-Bite army to encourage unhealthy eating habits in kids all over the world. Emboldened by the delicious and nutritious taste of Foundation Flakes™, The Kellogg's® O5 Council™ allowed Ignatz™ and Shy Sammy™ to join forces with Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ and Kellogg's® to defeat the Sark-Bite™ army using the power of a healthy breakfast! 
 Addendum-1: The following interview took place during a showdown between Mobile Taskforce YUM-1™ and Grand Karcist Ion™

SCP-3034-J,"""Voresnake""","""The following document is considered a QUÄLGEIST-Class non-anomalous cognitohazard. 
 Proceed at your own risk 
 Item #: SCP-3034-J 
 Object Class: Whatever keeps it as far away from people as possible Thaumiel1 
 Special Containment Procedures: The area containing SCP-3034-J, currently a region of the Indian Ocean roughly 300km in diameter, is to be routinely patrolled by unmanned Foundation naval vessels. Under no circumstances are civilians allowed to attempt deep sea exploration or diving efforts in the quarantined area. Civilians attempting to enter the quarantined area are to be immediately deterred by a squadron of MTF Epsilon-13 (""Infernal Shocktroopers"") armed with spray bottles. 
 Individuals associated with the ""vore""2 community are not to be assigned to SCP-3034-J under any circumstances. Individuals affected by the anomalous properties of SCP-3034-J are to seriously rethink their life choices and get professional help.3 In the event that individuals fail to reconsider the consequences of their actions under the influence of SCP-3034-J, Class-E amnestics are to be administered immediately.4 D-Class personnel utilized for Protocol-612 ""Deific Eulogy"" are to NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, HAVE ACCESS TO ANY COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE. 
 Description: SCP-3034-J is a large aquatic serpent. The full length of SCP-3034-J is unknown, but is unfortunately large enough to swallow an indefinite number of humans. Similarly, the size of SCP-3034-J's mouth is unfortunately four meters from bottom to top, more than sufficient to consume humans. 
 SCP-3034-J demonstrates by far the most disturbing memetic effect the Foundation has had the displeasure of coming into contact with. Individuals who come within approximately 300 meters of SCP-3034-J will begin to vocalize a strong desire to be consumed by SCP-3034-J, and will take any available course of action to be consumed. This is considered to be a method by which SCP-3034-J catches prey and serves as an abomination before the eyes of God.5 Additionally, vocalizations by individuals under the influence of SCP-3034-J are to be considered a Class-ψ cognitohazard, and result in a φK-Class Loss-Of-Faith-In-Humanity scenario within 84.77% of exposed individuals who are not amnesticized within three days. 
 While normally a creature as atrocious as SCP-3034-J would warrant the ""accidental"" leaking of both the containment area and guard schedule to the Global Occult Coalition, SCP-3034-J has unfortunately proven itself invaluable to the Foundation through its spontaneous excretion of large masses of crystalline-form carbon and a proven catholicon for degenerative and abnormal cell growth (designated SCP-3034-J-1).6 As such, suspension of Protocol-612 ""Deific Eulogy"" would leave the Foundation vulnerable to XK-Class ""I guess you like cancer"" accusations. 
 The unfortunate fact that SCP-3034-J is invaluable to the Foundation has forced us to develop Protocol-612 ""Deific Eulogy"" after a majority vote by the Ethics Committee.7 
 Protocol-612 ""Deific Eulogy"": 
 I'm not paid enough to copy down the whole thing. Here's my abridged version. 
 Fucking yeet a D-Class into the maw of SCP-3034-J, then collect the goods via drone. 
 Addendum 3034-J-A: 
 Mobile Task Force Gamma-39 (""In Over Their Heads"") was assigned to investigate an unusual string of maritime disappearances.8 
 Alpha: Ok fellas, we've got a strange sea creature. Should be par for the course. This'll be my last dive before I retire on ██/██/████, so let's make it count! 
 Bravo, Foxtrot, and Echo vocalize their affirmation. 
 Alpha: Exiting airlock now. 
 Alpha, taking the position of the bottom of the ""T"", exits the airlock. Due to the rigid structure of the steel rods, the rest of the squad is unable to enter the water for 39.3 seconds. Eventually, Echo manages to tilt the formation in such a manner that the team is able to slide through at an angle. 
 Echo: I have visual on the skip. Best guess is that we're about 326.2527 meters from it. 
 Alpha: Alright men, as a little added incentive to get this done well, you're all invited to my retirement party. It will be held at ████, ███████ lane, and the date will be ██/██/████. My lovely family, including ████ ██████ will be present, and be sure to thank Dr. ████████ for my recent █████ surgery last ███sday. 
 Echo: Yeah, your party sounds fun, but getting eaten by that eel sounds much better. 
 Alpha: Excuse me, what? 
 Foxtrot: Sorry Alpha, I'm with Echo on this one. We should probably conduct an.. in depth exploration of this thing from the inside. 
 Alpha: Command, you all getting this? We've got a possible memetic effect coming from that sexy eel and we need assistance pronto. 
 Command: Affirmative. Stay put where you are, we'll send you more information about these cognitive effects as we receive it. 
 Bravo: Nah, let's check out the eel. 
 Foxtrot and Echo signal their support of Bravo's idea over Alpha's complaints and begin swimming towards SCP-3034-J, overpowering Alpha's attempts to go towards the surface. 
 Alpha: You little shits! If you get eaten by that thing you are uninvited to my retirement party, which I remind you is taking place at ████, ███████ lane! 
 Echo: Sir, our mission is to gain insight of the anomalous effects of SCP-3034-J, and my inner researcher is telling me that this can best be attained by entrance of SCP-3034-J. 
 Bravo: Expunge me, daddy! 
 Bravo swims into the mouth of SCP-3034-J. 
 Alpha: WHY THE HELL DID YOU SWIM INTO THAT THING? MY RETIREMENT WAS GOING TO [EXTRANEOUS IDENTIFYING INFORMATION REMOVED]. 
 Echo: Sir, you appear to be suffering from some memetic effect and have lost track of the mission. I would advise you to clear your head before joining us. 
 Echo swims into SCP-3034-J's mouth, with the ensuing motion of the ""T"" bringing a jubilant Foxtrot into the maw as well. 
 Foxtrot: [DATA EXPUNGED]9 
 Alpha: I'm seeing piles of something next to that stud of an eel. Before I continue the mission, I'm going to send some of it up to y'all. Sorry I'm slowing down our timing a bit. Don't know what came over me. By the way, feel free to send as many people down here as you would like. 
 Command: Wait a second you thick… 
 Alpha entered SCP-3034-J immediately after sending a capsule full of diamonds and SCP-3034-J-1 to the surface. 
 Addendum 3034-J-B 
 The following document requires a Level 5/3034-J security clearance. Failure to successfully click the red words input these highly complex credentials will result in immediate termination. 
 Analysis of SCP-3034-J has concluded that the memetic effect only manifests in 89% of cases. In other words, 11% of individuals ""affected"" by SCP-3034-J are acting entirely of their own volition. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to finish up the final paperwork and chug the gallon jug of amnestics that I pilfered from storage. 
 Consider this as my formal request to never be assigned to SCP-3034-J, or any other skip with a numerical designation in the 3000s. 
 Sincerely yours,
Researcher █████ 
 Researcher Stone was found in his quarters passed out from an overdose of amnestics, with an empty milk carton clutched in one hand.

SCP-3V1L-J,"""The Master Plan""","""Object Class: SAFE for fuck's sake 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3V1L-J is to be kept in solitary confinement in a humanoid containment cell. No further communication is to be made between SCP-3V1L-J and staff. All staff are advised that, despite any and all claims made by SCP-3V1L-J, no further containment procedures will be necessary. 
 Description: SCP-3V1L-J, formerly Arthur Schnittflieger of Kenosha, WI, is a 32-year-old human male involved in a string of criminal activities carried out through the use of anomalous means. It possesses the superhuman ability to, to an extent, convince other people that it has a brilliant and complicated agenda that cannot be stopped under any circumstances. 
 On 12/20/12, SCP-3V1L-J phoned in a threat to the Foundation that it was going to create a wormhole to ""another dimension full of spiders and fire and stuff"" inside the Mall of America. Agents were mobilized to the location and found no wormhole, after which SCP-3V1L-J contacted the Foundation again with another threat - that the previous plan with the wormhole was merely a distraction from a ZK-class reality failure event it was about to cause. No evidence was found of any such event being within SCP-3V1L-J's capabilities. 
 This pattern continued for some time, resulting in a total of 0 casualties, 0 ""lifted veil"" events, and approximately 12 billion dollars lost by the Foundation in wasted response efforts. Primary containment of SCP-3V1L-J was established on 10/14/14, after a ten-hour standoff at Site-155 over a nonexistent ""heavily-armed badger machine."" 
 Interrogation log: 
 Dr. Henderson: Good evening. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: Is it really a good evening? Is any evening good when your life is as twisted as mine, when you look deep into the depths of your mind and find only screaming clowns stabbing each other in the hearts over and over again forever, and you can only laugh in misery? 
 Dr. Henderson: Noted. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: Of course you'd say ""noted."" I anticipated it! I can read you like a Wal-Mart receipt, Dr. Jackson. 
 Dr. Henderson: That's Henderson. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: Of course it is. You don't think I knew that already? 
 Dr. Henderson: No, since you just called me Dr. Jackson. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: It was all a ruse! You're so naive, thinking I'd ever tell the truth to a moralizing freak like yourself. Where you see good and bad, I only see madness! MADNESS! I can see things you could never dream of, like the flesh-eating reptile that's behind you right now! 
 Dr. Henderson: There is nothing behind me. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: OR IS THERE? 
 Dr. Henderson: No, there really is nothing behind me. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: So quick to judge. You haven't even looked! 
 [Dr. Henderson looks behind himself.] 
 SCP-3V1L-J: It was all a ruse! Again! You only pretend you can control my inhuman brilliance to make yourselves feel safer. I could destroy the entire Foundation with one spoken word, mortal! 
 Dr. Henderson: And what word is that? 
 SCP-3V1L-J: ""Madness."" 
 Dr. Henderson: You've already said that word a few times by now. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: Then you're even more doomed than you can imagine! I've been picking you weaklings apart piece by piece for all my life, and my sheer genius has doomed you all. 
 Dr. Henderson: This interrogation is going nowhere. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: Aha! I knew you'd say that. 
 [Dr. Henderson attempts to leave the interrogation room.] 
 SCP-3V1L-J: FOOL! I've laced the doorknob with psychomemetic übertoxin. You've sealed your fate. 
 Dr. Henderson: Then why am I not dead?! 
 SCP-3V1L-J: Sounds like someone's in denial. 
 Dr. Henderson: Sounds like someone's going to get doused in battery acid if they don't learn how to shut their goddamned mouth for more than ten seconds. 
 SCP-3V1L-J: I knew you'd say that too! God I'm so smart.

SPC-3284-J,"""Lava Sharks""","""Item #: SPC-3284-J 
 Object Class: Great White 
 Shark Punching Contingencies: Due to the extreme heat, instances of SPC-3284 are nearly impossible to engage in their natural habitat. The current protocol for dealing with SPC-3284 infestations is to drain the lava lake they are located in, and then move in to punch them while wearing heat-proof armor. For this reason, Mobile Fist Team Sigma-6 (""Flaming Fists of Fury"") are to be included in all 3284-related operations. 
 Description: SPC-3284 is a species of silicon-based life form that superficially resemble Carcharodon carcharias. Instances of SPC-3284 typically inhabit bodies of molten lava, and have a unique physiology that allows them to ""swim"" through it as easily as an ordinary shark swims through water. They do not seem to require sustenance beyond the thermal energy provided by their environment, but will attempt to consume any organic material they can reach. The mechanism used to detect organic material is unknown at this time. 
 SPC-3284 was first discovered during a raid on a Marshall, Carter and Shark Ltd. facility, where they were using genetic engineering and [DATA EXPUNGED] to produce designer sharks to sell to the highest bidders. Using documents acquired from the raid, Center agents were able to track a shipment of SPC-3284 to a lava lake in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, at least █ infestations of SPC-3284 have been discovered, including one in ████████████ National Park. Current research suggests that populations of SPC-3284 annually migrate to new locations through the Earth's mantle. This, combined with their ability to live off thermal energy, may explain why their populations are so widespread. Efforts to drill through the mantle are ongoing.""",,+198,active,alive animal esoteric-class joke marshall-carter-and-dark piscine scp selachian shark-punching-center species thermal,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//spc-3284-j
SCP-3333-J,"""Angsty Teenage Plant""","""Item #: SCP-3333-J 
 Object Class: Safe (but grouchy in the mornings) 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3333-J is to remain in the second-floor Site-19 break room, because it should really socialize more often. It is to be provided a terracotta plant pot (yes, even though all its friends have plastic pots, there's nothing wrong with terracotta) and watered thrice a week with bottled water (because tap water makes it even moodier). It is not to be allowed to overnight outside, no matter how much it thinks it doesn't need a jacket. 
 Note: SCP-3333-J apparently grows better when listening to songs by My Chemical Romance. It is allowed to do so as long as the volume is set to a reasonable level. 
 Description: SCP-3333-J is a juvenile potted plant. It is of the species Chlorophytum comosum, commonly known as the spider plant, but seems to show preference (accelerated growth) for being called the lesser-known name of “airplane plant”, as well as other names on occasion, such as sword fern, rogue’s gilliflower, damask violet, and black nightshade. Personnel are reminded to not be alarmed should SCP-3333-J show signs of apparent resentment (dropping leaves, growing mold, smelling strange) when not called these names. ""Spider plant"" is wholly accurate and sufficient, and SCP-3333-J will never become anything different by changing its name. 
 SCP-3333-J is not allowed to spend extended hours in the outside garden, no matter how much the darkly attractive evening primrose “gets” SCP-3333-J and its deep philosophies1. 
 SCP-3333-J has been known on occasions to wilt when exposed to its daily sunlight. Should this occur, it is to be gently but firmly explained that sunlight is a necessity, even if its tortured and misunderstood soul believes otherwise. Exhibiting careless phototropism is unacceptable. Furthermore, it knows it is responsible for helping reduce the air pollution of the room, and how can it do that without sunlight to keep it healthy and growing? 
 Addendum: SCP-3333-J is notoriously taciturn. It is noted that this behavior began when it first sprouted flowers. (See interview log) 
 Dr. ██████: Good morning, spider plant! You’re looking nice and leafy today. I see you grew flowers! Soon you’ll be ready to sprout cute little spiderettes. You’re growing up so fast. 
 SCP-3333-J: … 
 Dr. ██████: Oh. Okay. You're just not going to say anything? 
 SCP-3333-J: … 
 Dr. ██████: Well, if that's what you want… Wait. Is that fungus on the underside of your leaves? 
 SCP-3333-J: … [leaves rustle slightly as air conditioning picks up] 
 Dr. ██████: I thought I told you to be careful. Remember, if you get hooked on symbiotic root nodule bacteria and go making friends with the wrong crowd, you’re going to end up with root rot! I don't want that to happen! 
 SCP-3333-J: … 
 Dr. ██████: Maybe I should have been suspicious when you suddenly started sprouting flowers everywhere. You need to take care of yourself, okay? 
 SCP-3333-J: … 
 Dr. ██████: I can't buy special potting soil for you forever. 
 SCP-3333-J: … 
 Note: The following day, SCP-3333-J was relocated to a corner of the break room furthest from the window. It later disappeared, and was rediscovered moping under the coffee table, having somehow tipped on its side and rolled along the ground. Personnel were advised to let the plant stay there and think about its actions. 
 Memo: Hey Rivs, I think you’re being a little harsh on the plant. Maybe someone else should take care of it. —M 
 Memo: No. That plant is growing up and needs to learn from its mistakes. I know what I'm doing. —R

 SCP-3448-J — Should Have Taken Him Sleeping 
 Calibold's Mega Cool Author Page 
 Item #: SCP-3448-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3448-J is contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. All misinformation campaigns affirming the death of SCP-3448-J have been successful, and no further containment efforts are required. 
 Description: SCP-3448-J is the 26th president of the United States of America, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. Despite over 160 years having passed since SCP-3448-J's birth, it has not died, and has not aged since 1/6/1919. Additionally, testing has revealed that SCP-3448-J heals extremely quickly from all forms of damage, and bears remarkable stamina and tolerance for pain. The extent of these abilities is unknown, but is evidently far greater than the Foundation is willing to test. 
 Discovery: SCP-3448-J's anomalous properties were discovered on 1/6/1919, after the former president emerged from his chambers having made a full recovery from his otherwise fatal ailments. Foundation forces contained the former president, and began a misinformation campaign to convince the public that SCP-3448-J had died. SCP-3448-J's doctor at the time had been present in his room, and made notes of the interaction. 
 I am pained to confess that I had fallen asleep at the president's bedside. But I had been awoken by a strange scuffling at the door. 
 I looked. My mind may have still been partially asleep, but I bear no doubts that the visage which had entered into the president's chambers was none other than Death herself. 
 I remained still and silent; even in my dreary state, and faced with the passing of such a treasured and important man, I knew better than to confront Death whilst she collects her soul. 
 ""Theodore,"" she said, ""Your time is up."" 
 She pulled back the sheets of the president's bed to reveal a messy assortment of pillows and wadded laundry. Behind Death, unseen, President Roosevelt emerged from the shadows. 
 ""Bully,"" he said as he punched Death in the face.

SCP-3467-J,"""Six Foot Man-Eating-Chicken""","""Item #: SCP-3467 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3467 is to be made fun of at every opportunity. Heckling, practical jokes and pranks are good examples. Filming the more spectacular procedures is a must. 
 Description: SCP-3467 is a six (6) foot tall, two hundred (200) pound man eating chicken. Subject is thirty five (35), slightly balding, dark brown hair and eyes, and slightly overweight. Name is Hank ██████████, and he has worked as a Level 1 cleanup crew for the past three years. Hank is never seen without a bucket of chicken and only stops eating it when actually working, which is a rare occurrence in itself. 
 It is known that Hank still lives in his mom's basement, and hearsay amongst the female staff is that he is still a virgin. 
 Additional Notes: All video footage of the more impressive ""procedures"" performed on Hank are available in the central reading area. 
 Document 3467-01: ""Dammit guys, this isn't funny. The system still freaks out when I enter the building, and I don't have clearance to delete this stupid file. Thanks a lot, assholes."" Hank ██████████ 
 Document 3467-02: ""Now this is a bit unfair. I mean, it's not his fault he's fat, balding, still lives with his mom and… No, no, sorry, I can't say that with a straight face. Come on, alright, let me try it again, I'll do it properly this time, I promise."" Dr.██████ 
 Document 3467-03: In accordance with SCP protocols associated with this item, the following record of Special Containment Procedures carried out by Dr. Gears is submitted. 
 After Incident [DATA EXPUNGED]. With its incapacitation, SCP-682 regeneration was being monitored via a sealed observation booth. This booth projected twelve feet into the current containment area, constructed of transparent super dense plastic developed by [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-3467 was instructed to clean the observation booth. When SCP-3467 was at the far end to the booth, the security door was locked. 
 The sounds of SCP-3467 attempting to escape and Dr. Gears's uncontrollable laughter attracted the attention of a 67% regenerated SCP-682. SCP-682 attempted to attack SCP-3467; however, its current state posed no danger to the structural stability of the booth. 
 Dr. Gears observed SCP-3467 to emit a loud, extremely high-pitched scream not unlike a small female child. SCP-3467 proceeded to whimper like said small child and ask for “Mommy”. SCP-3467 was instructed to “bark like a dog” if he wished to exit the booth. SCP-3467 proceeded to bark like a small, frightened canine for 48 seconds, after which the security door was opened. 
 It was observed that SCP-3467 had defecated himself at some point during the event. 
 Recordings of the event are available via a request to Central Records, or Dr. Gears.

SCP-3472-J,"""In time, you will come to hate me.""","""Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3472-J is to be stored inside a padded locker in the High Value Anomalous Object Storage wing of Site 56. No further containment measures are necessary. 
 On the order of Site Director Agatha Drummond, testing of SCP-3472-J is to be held indefinitely. 
 Description: SCP-3472-J is a 500 mL glass vial filled with a viscous, semi-translucent blue substance. The contents of the bottle replenish at a rate of 5 mL/hour while not full. Foreign substances are blocked from entering SCP-3472-J by an invisible barrier. 
 5 minutes after an individual ingests more than 20 mL of SCP-3472-J's contents, they will enter a comatose state lasting between 2 and 5 hours. Upon waking, subjects report experiencing vivid dreams from the point of view of a man named ""Jamison Maddox"" (hereby referred to as SCP-3472-1-J). Recovered documentation suggests that such dreams share an internally consistent if anachronistically presented timeline. 
 SCP-3472-J was recovered during a raid on the residence of Annetta Maddox. Ms. Maddox had been chronicling her usage of SCP-3472-J in a journal prior to recovery. Unfortunately, Ms. Maddox perished during the raid and was therefore unable to be questioned. 
 Among Ms. Maddox's possessions was the following letter, allegedly written by SCP-3472-1-J: 
 My beloved daughter,

In time, no doubt, you'll come to hate me for the things I've done. I admit to my cowardice, my foolishness, the sickening simian frame of mind that colored my sins.

I will not defend my actions. All I ask is that you come to understand the why of it.

SCP-3560-J,"""A Discerning Gentleman""","""Item #: SCP-3560-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3560-J is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell with anti-reality bending suppressors a spacious room, decorated and outfitted in the style of a traditional English manor drawing room. A very fine, life-sized painting of SCP-3560-J holding a pipe and wearing hunting attire should be hung above the fireplace. SCP-3560-J is to be permitted a black labrador as a pet. SCP-3560-J is to be allowed long walks in the countryside and - 
 Update: Project Lead Doctor Simmons was caught in the middle of making alterations to the start of the Special Containment Procedures as seen above1. Doctor Simmons has been temporarily relieved of duty and is currently undergoing screening for memetic contamination by SCP-3560-J. An accurate Special Containment Procedures document will be published shortly. 
 Under no circumstances are the beverages tea, coffee or related drinks to enter within a 100-meter radius of SCP-3560-J, except during approved testing. On special request from Doctor Simmons, SCP-3560-J can be served English Breakfast tea with milk, made to exact specifications2. 
 Note from Doctor Simmons to all site staff - I realise everyone in Sector B hates this ban, and me by extension. I know the Foundation runs on caffeine… but until we can rule out exactly what's safe and what isn't, I'm not taking any chances. Just be thankful it's out of range of the cafeteria. 
 Description: SCP-3560-J, also known in urban myth as ""The Discerning Gentleman"", ""The Tea Gentlemen"", ""T-Man"" or ""The Tea Nazi"", is a humanoid entity with the appearance of a wealthy 19th century English ""gentleman"". SCP-3560-J speaks in an upper-class English accent and wears clothing and accouterments typical to English gentry of the 1880's period3. 
 SCP-3560-J was considered an urban legend until the Foundation was called in to investigate a string of bizarre murders across the USA, ultimately resulting in the discovery of SCP-3560-J and its eventual capture4. 
 Although sounding and appearing human, SCP-3560-J has a modus operandi with anomalous effects. People visited by SCP-3560-J (hereby referred to as ""subjects"") appear to be picked at random, however they all have one common circumstance. SCP-3560-J materializes close to a subject when the subject is making a cup of the beverage tea - typically of the English Breakfast variety, with milk. SCP-3560-J produces a mild memetic effect on the subject. After the subject's initial surprise they appear to accept SCP-3560-J's presence, treating 'him' like an irritating friend, or cantankerous older relative5. 
 After appearing, SCP-3560-J proceeds to critically evaluate the quality of the subject's tea-making process, according to SCP-3560-J's own - very specific - standards. SCP-3560-J typically begins with polite remarks and suggestions to improve the final product, but can become increasingly irate, and in some cases homicidal, should the subject not meet the high standards that SCP-3560-J demands. 
 These include examples such as precise tea to milk ratio, quantity of milk in teacup, length of time to steep tea leaves, the temperature of the tea, aesthetics of teacup, etc6. If the subject survives to the point of serving the tea, SCP-3560-J tastes it before delivering a final verdict; gives verbal advice or punishment as appropriate, and then de-materialises7. 
 Capture and Containment:
SCP-3560-J was eventually captured on [██-██-20██] by luring it into containment. 30 D-Class personnel were used to make tea in different methods known to anger SCP-3560-J. The procedure was also successful thanks to the assistance of Lord Blackwood and by abusing the appearance and abilities of SCP-26498. 
 Current Foundation technology installed at SCP-3560-J's containment chamber prevents SCP-3560-J from being able to de-materialise or leave the premises. SCP-3560-J's other anomalous abilities seem to be unaffected. 
 Since its capture, SCP-3560-J has exhibited unpredictable behaviour. At some times it is co-operative with researchers - seemingly resigned to its fate - and can be conversed with. At other times it is openly hostile, or displays symptoms of depression and becomes unresponsive. Placating SCP-3560-J with tea made to its exacting standards has proved an effective means of curbing its mood swings. 
 So far, experiments and interviews have revealed little about SCP-3560-J's origins, background or true nature, aside from its obsessive fixation with tea. A common topic of SCP-3560-J's conversations with staff are lamentations on how tea-making standards have dropped in the past century. SCP-3560-J refers to itself only as ""a discerning gentleman"". 
 ""Let me ask you again, Doctor. In this wonderous age of technical wizardry and false idols, is it too much to ask that if one is to make a cup of tea, they do it right? It vexes me, I tell you. It…. vexes me. Where's the quality? The pride in a job well done? Pass the sugar please, there's a good chap.""
SCP-3560-J 
 ""He may be a psychotic bastard but I have to admit, he knows how to make a damned good cup of tea.""

 Experiment Log Summaries
Note: All experiment subjects are D-Class personnel unless otherwise stated.

Experiment Number: T-008
Experiment Overview: Make Earl Grey tea in SCP-3560-J's presence (using teabag).
Experiment Results: As soon as SCP-3560-J noticed the teabag in the cup was Earl Grey, SCP-3560-J swept its arm across the table, knocking over the experiment's set-up and badly scalding D-1084. Experiment aborted.
SCP-3560-J: ""Not that bloody dog's piss again! Get it OUT OF MY SIGHT!""

Experiment Number: T-12
Experiment Overview: Tea was made to standards known to appease SCP-3560-J. However, the tea was served in a large mug with the message ""I *heart* T""9.
Experiment Results: SCP-3560-J stated the tea was passable, but chided the subject for her ""vulgar taste"", ""childlike behaviour"" and ""complete lack of refinement"".

Experiment Number: T-21
Experiment Overview: D-Class personnel given appropriate equipment to make high quality cafetiere coffee, and instructed to make coffee in SCP-3560-J's presence.
Experiment Results: SCP-3560-J initially disregarded the subject and the activity, merely tutting and watching out of the corner of its eye. Eventually the subject accidentally spilt some coffee grinds, prompting a response from SCP-3560-J. It sighed and stood up, saying ""It's really not my cup of tea, but if you will insist on making it in front of me, will you at least put some effort into it?"". SCP-3560-J then (somewhat half-heartedly) slapped the subject in the face with its gloves a number of times, and proceeded to instruct the subject in how to make a ""good cup of coffee"". SCP-3560-J refused to try the result, but let the subject off with a broken wrist and a shouted warning to Doctor Simmons not to taunt it with inferior beverages again.

Experiment Number: T-25
Experiment Overview: D-28732 was told to make tea however they prefer, in the presence of SCP-3560-J.
Experiment Results: Excerpt of recorded audio:
SCP-3560-J (Screaming):
""I SAID…""
Cracking noise
""STEEP THE BAG…""
Cracking noise
""FOR TWO MINUTES!""
Crunching noise.
(Subject D-28732 expired 2 minutes later.)

Experiment Number: T-83
Experiment Overview: SCP-2649 transported to SCP-3560-J's chamber, 2 hours after feeding10 (appropriate security measures in place). D-Class personnel instructed to make a pot of tea using SCP-2649.
Experiment Results:
SCP-3560-J immediately regarded SCP-2649 with fear, rising to intense horror (note that to this point, SCP-2649 had remained immobile). SCP-3560-J then crossed itself three times, backed away slowly and eventually cowered in the corner of the chamber, arms over its head - whimpering and muttering unintelligible words under its breath. SCP-3560-J then started to shout out, pleading with Doctor Simmons ""take it away, please, I beg you!"". These pleas continued until SCP-2649 became semi-active once the D-Class personnel started preparing the tea. Upon seeing this, SCP-3560-J [REMAINDER OF EXPERIMENT REDACTED]. Doctor Simmons later apologised profusely to SCP-3560-J, and has since put a temporary hold on cross-testing it with SCP-2649.

Experiment Number: T-103
Experiment Overview: A modern branded luxury tea and coffee making appliance was set up in SCP-3560-J's containment chamber by a D-Class subject. The subject was instructed to make a cup of tea using the appropriate preset button. Note: All relevant ingredients are pre-stored inside the device, with the beverage-making process also performed entirely within the machine - eventually pouring the final product into a cup placed in the machine's receptacle.
Experiment Results:
As soon as D-2489 entered the chamber carrying the device, SCP-3560-J eyed the machine with great suspicion. When D-2489 turned it on and started the tea program, SCP-3560-J approached the machine with a look of intense disgust. Twenty seconds into the process SCP-3560-J started screaming obscenities at the machine. By forty seconds into the process, SCP-3560-J, still screaming, had begun beating it furiously with its cane.
By the fifty-second mark, SCP-3560-J's screams had risen in pitch and volume to a piercing sound, as Doctor Simmons described it; ""a banshee's shriek"". The beverage machine, although damaged, was still functioning (and being quite heavy, it had remained in place). At one minute into the process, the volume of SCP-3560-J's shriek had reached over 200 decibels and burst D-2489's eardrums (who was now beating on the chamber door, begging to be let out). SCP-3560-J was now clawing at the device with its hands and beating at it. SCP-3560-J then - still shrieking - moved swiftly to grab D-2489, and with inhuman strength started to pound D-2489's head and upper body onto the machine, using D-2489's hair as leverage. The device (and D-2489) finally expired under this frenzied assault. SCP-3560-J, still panting but no longer shrieking, wiped its brow with its handkerchief, and in a threatening tone warned Doctor Simmons never to insult it in such a manner again; ""lest you want to see the very depths of Hell with your own two eyes!"". Testing was suspended for 2 weeks after this incident, until SCP-3560-J had sufficiently calmed to resume experimentation.
Experiment Number: T-128
Experiment Overview: Regular tea-making test using a baseline tea-set, one of a series of experiments to gauge SCP-3560-J's shifting standards over time. Tea was made by D-33012, an elderly female of British descent.
Experiment Results:
SCP-3560-J observed the tea-making process closely, at times peering centimetres from D-33012's handiwork. The subject was exacting in her movements and decisions, making no apparent mistakes. Unusually, SCP-3560-J stayed almost completely silent during the process, occasionally scratching its head with a puzzled expression, and only vocalising occasional ""hmmm""s, and at one point ""ahhh!"".
After D-33012 offered SCP-3560-J the cup of tea and SCP-3560-J tasted it, the entity broke into a grin, declaring with enthusiasm: ""Wonderful! Exquisite! Superb! A triumph… a marvel! Madam, you have achieved perfection! This sorry world does not deserve you, the Heavens await!"". On saying these words, a cylindrical and blinding bright white light appeared around D-33012. One second later, with a surprised expression, D-33012 vanished, along with the light. SCP-3560-J then swooned loudly, dabbing a handkerchief on its forehead, and collapsed.
SCP-3560-J came to one hour later, telling Doctor Simmons: ""It was the best cup of tea I've ever had, Doctor, and she deserved to be rewarded handsomely. You see, there are some good people left in the world, after all! It makes it all worthwhile!"" Subsequent scans and searches of the Site housing SCP-3560-J were unsuccessful in locating D-33012 and the subject's whereabouts remain a mystery. A background check revealed that in middle age the subject had served as a senior maid in the British Royal Household. For the next 3 weeks, SCP-3560-J's demeanour was noticeably more positive than usual, with SCP-3560-J also disregarding many ""infractions"" during tea-making experiments which would normally incur its ire. 
 End of Experiment Log Summary 
 Note from Doctor Simmons: The following document is full of minutae which is probably only of interest to testers and true tea aficionados. The rest of you (i.e. normal people), might want to skip this appendix. 
 The following methods for making tea have proven, on average, not to incur the wrath of SCP-3560-J. Due to SCP-3560-J's whims changing on a daily basis, only D-Class personnel should perform the process, and serve the tea. Any leftover tea, cakes, scones or biscuits (especially HobNobs) from successful experiments should be handed over to Doctor Simmons for ""testing"" - Note - Please disregard the previous statement. Doctor Simmons has been reprimanded for editing an SCP document for his own personal gain. 
 Tea Ware
Matching tea sets are preferred. Note that SCP-3560-J does not like pink flowers as decoration on teaware, as they ""make it feel sick"". Imagery of cats should also be avoided as SCP-3560-J considers them ""Infernal Creatures"". 
 Ingredients
A full list of preferred brands, ingredient sources, and experiment logs using such ingredients is available on request. Staff are reminded that office sweepstakes based on SCP-3560-J's reaction to popular brands of tea are not only unprofessional, but subject to official reprimand.

The following processes are fairly reliable in placating SCP-3560-J. Exact measurements for different sets of teaware and ingredients can be requested from the Project Lead. 
 Note from Doctor Simmons: Valuable subjects or staff making tea for SCP-3560-J should practice in advance, with other people closely scrutinising their process and criticising it. Researcher Barry Hayes is particularly good at playing the part of SCP-3560-J, Barry can make you feel like a real shit, a worthless worm, a piece of scum who can't even make a cup of tea right. You know what, I think Barry's a bad person. Don't expect to see Barry around here any more, I'm going to get him transferred. Barry, if you're reading this, you shouldn't have made a grown man cry. 
 Using Tea Bags 
 Using Tea Pots
As above, but with the following changes: 
 Accompanying Foods
(See extra documentation for more information on foodstuffs.) 
 Serving tea with certain foodstuffs is acceptable or even desirable to SCP-3560-J. Traditional accompaniments such as freshly-baked scones (served with butter and jam), cakes, or biscuits are the most tolerated foodstuffs. In SCP-3560-J's earshot, ""scones"" should always be pronounced as though it rhymes with ""owns"". Failure to do so will brand you a commoner in SCP-3560-J's eyes, with 
 SCP-3560-J's self-professed favourite tea accompaniment is fruit scones served with butter and raspberry jam. It is also quite partial to chocolate digestive biscuits, although it never dips biscuits into tea, calling such actions reprehensible and immoral. It will severely punish anyone it spots attempting a ""dirty dunk"".

 Special Containment Procedures: An armed guard is to be stationed outside the entrance at all times, with orders to terminate any individual attempting to enter SCP-3790-J. Once a day, this guard is to enter SCP-3790-J and maintain all contained entities, with orders to terminate any entity approaching the door. 
 Description: SCP-3790-J is the Colonial Shopping Plaza PetSmart in Miami, Florida, now abandoned. It is accessible through the large automatic doors at the front of the store1. A paper sign is taped to the inside of the door, reading ""SEALED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ABNORMALITIES"". 
 The interior of SCP-3790-J is structured similar to a standard PetSmart2. The store is divided into several aisles and walkways, with four checkouts at the front. Only one of these checkouts is open at a time; it is unclear whether this is also an anomalous effect. 
 The vast majority of SCP-3790-J is empty, excluding four aisles near the back of the store. Each of these aisles contains four animal habitats, excluding Aisle Four. Each habitat contains an entity, is marked with a phrase written in Sharpie permanent marker, and has all openings sealed shut.

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3999-J is to be contained at Site-42 in specialized containment wing R. On 25 JUNE 2014, Researcher James Talloran volunteered to dedicate around-the-clock support to containing SCP-3999-J. As such, Researcher Talloran has been forbidden from leaving containment wing R under threat of lethal force. All visiting researchers to containment wing R must be cleared by Researcher Talloran. 
 Additionally, containment wing R has the following requirements: 
 Description: SCP-3999-J is an entity capable of causing an XK End-Of-World scenario at will. Accounts of its appearance are inconsistent, and it is believed that it can shapeshift. It can appear as a half-bear, half-man creature with many tentacles coming out of its back, or a nondescript human. Originally, it made stubborn demands for food and large sums of US currency, but Researcher Talloran has devised several containment strategies to keep its effects at bay. 
 SCP-3999-J's secondary effect is an anti-memetic field that erases all memories of itself from anyone who views it. This effect occurs in real-time, so the entity appears invisible. However, Researcher Talloran is immune to the anti-memetic effect. Studies are underway to determine Researcher Talloran's unique immunity to SCP-3999-J. 
 UPDATE 05 JANUARY 2015: Guest Researchers Candi Madison, Jackie Love, and Emma Angel have agreed to indefinitely assist Researcher Talloran in containment efforts. 
 UPDATE 05 MARCH 2015: Guest Researchers Mitch Talloran and Trevor Mason were both confirmed to be immune to SCP-3999-J, and have agreed to indefinitely assist Researcher James Talloran in containment efforts. 
 UPDATE 19 APRIL 2015: Guest Researchers Alexa Cuti and Ivy Hart have agreed to indefinitely assist Researcher Talloran in containment efforts.

STAFF: Uhhh… let me check. No, sorry. You're not on the list. Only essential containment personnel can request meal delivery.
RESEARCHER TALLORAN: Oh. I see. Well, uhm, I've got a Keter entity here and I need a cheeseburger and fries to contain it.

RESEARCHER TALLORAN: It's no trouble, director, really.
DIRECTOR LYCUS: How are the latest containment procedures working?
RESEARCHER TALLORAN: Oh, they're great. The containment course was really a great idea. By driving around it at high speeds in those super cars, we're able to really just, uh, contain the hell out of three-nine-nine-nine.
DIRECTOR LYCUS: Does this mean the old containment procedures are no longer necessary? You don't need the pool or the containment buffet anymore?
RESEARCHER TALLORAN: Uhm, no sir, not at all sir, those are still absolutely, absolutely necessary. I mean the cars only work on it for so long, sir. It, uhm, adapts to them quickly, you know, and only by, wrestling with it into that pool with my fellow researchers can we really, you know, keep it contained. And the buffet, I mean, three-nine-nine-nine wants that like five or six times a day, so that's, no, we need to keep that.
DIRECTOR LYCUS: Roger that. So all of your previous containment procedures are still effective?
RESEARCHER TALLORAN: Yeah, yeah. But listen, you know, the bar by the pool, three-nine-nine-nine, well I think he's adapting to the selection there, I was hoping to restock with some different varieties.
DIRECTOR LYCUS: Absolutely, I'll approve it. Anything else?
RESEARCHER TALLORAN: Yeah, I'll be putting in another order for xbox games, three-nine-nine-nine has adapted to all of those also.
DIRECTOR LYCUS: Of course.

DIRECTOR LYCUS: Godspeed to you. 
 UPDATE 05 AUGUST 2017: SCP-3999-J has demonstrated the ability to memetically affect remote individuals, causing them to hallucinate. This typically manifests as illusions of Researcher Talloran entering and leaving the containment facility. It also manifested remotely when one off-duty scientist hallucinated Researcher Talloran entering a casino, and later that day when another staff member hallucinated seeing Researcher Talloran purchasing an automobile. On that same occasion, an entire team of containment personnel hallucinated picking up Researcher Talloran at a hospital after they hallucinated him drunkenly text them that he had crashed into a parked car.

SCP-4001-J,"""Life, Read Right to Left""","""Item #: SCP-4001-B 
 Object Class: Safe1 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4001-B is secured within a steel bunker, constructed for its containment in Tokyo, Japan. The buildings around the bunker have been purchased by the Foundation, and are being rented out to a number of karate dojos, cheap love hotels, and cheaper ramen bars to help maintain the facade. 
 In the event of a large hostile assault against SCP-4001-B, all available teams are to be deployed to defend SCP-4001-B2. 
 Open flames are strictly forbidden within SCP-4001-B, as are missile launchers, shruiken or kunai, or katanas of any kind. Writing utensils may only be brought inside SCP-4001-B with a majority vote by the O5-Council3. 
 Description: SCP-4001-B consists of a small doorway within a basement, leading to a staircase descending 15 meters below ground. The staircase enters into a large room stacked with bookshelves4. The room does not conform to Euclidian geometry; it is possible to walk in any one direction and eventually return to the point of origin. 
 The room is filled entirely by bookshelves. The main walkway originates from the staircase and runs in both directions the full length of SCP-4001-B, with funky futon mats situated every 20 meters along the main walkway5. Under appropriate lighting conditions, it is possible to see oneself in the distance by looking in the appropriate direction. 
 SCP-4001-B represents a complete archive of every human life to date, and is continuously self-updating. Every human being that has ever lived has a single corresponding shonen manga within the archive, covering all important events in their life in a typically exaggerated format. As humans are born, new books are added to the archive. Books are stored in order of individuals' births, and the spine and front cover of each book is inscribed with the name of those it refers to. The general text and speech bubbles are written in a language which is simultaneously unlike any existing language known to the Foundation, while simultaneously being completely comprehensible to any literate individual reading it6. The total number of books is estimated at approximately 120 billion. 
 The contents of the books represent the idealised life of the individuals contained within. Altering the contents of the books has a corresponding effect upon reality, with names, vendettas, superpowers, hair colour7 and style, backstories, waifus, fetishes and perversions, personality quirks, and even complete existences changing accordingly to alterations applied to the book. Important life events are included, but they are exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness, with individuals demonstrating abilities and personality traits far beyond their own. As such, amendments made directly to books typically do not result in any change unless specifically entered in manga format, and suitably exaggerated as is expected of shonen manga. 
 SCP-4001-B was first encountered by Foundation staff in 19██. A local group of teenagers were attempting to use the archives to write their history papers, among other uses8. 
 Notable Texts: 
 The Sultry Stories of Cleopatra of the Nile. Details the life of Cleopatra VII, last pharaoh of Egypt. A supremely hardcore hentai with political undertones. Chapters include [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]9. 
 The Martial Chronicles of Joan d'Arc. Details the life of French commander and religious figurehead Joan of Arc. Chapters include a lengthy conversation with SCP-343, multiple battles using sorcery, cannonades, and sniper rifles, a number of katana duels with English knights, and a spectacularly tragic death scene of her burning at the stake spanning some 50 heartrending pages. 
 The Wonderful Life of Leonardo Da Vinci. Details the life of artist, engineer and all around polymath Leonardo Da Vinci. Comedic in tone. Chapters include multiple torrid love affairs with various men, multiple wacky adventures with his devices, a Q-like relationship with a weirdo figure in a hood with no fear of heights, and a chapter where he builds a time machine so he can get proper notes and sketches for his masterpiece The Last Supper. 
 The Ruthless Royal, Henry ""Fuck the Pope (and Anything Else That Moves)"" Tudor VIII. Details the life of English king Henry VIII. Chapters include several jousting tourneys10, his incredibly profane rap battle with Pope Clement VII, a large number of explicit hentai scenes with various numbers of his seventeen wives, the brutal executions of four of his wives (including a lengthy superpowered fight with Anne Boleyn), and his eventual death due to hyper-obesity. 
 The Life and Times of Abraham ""Breaker of Chains"" Lincoln. Details the life of American President Abraham Lincoln. Chapters include his early career as a pugilist lawyer, his brutal broadsword duel against James Shields, his brief tenure as a vampire slayer, a number of spectacular hand to hand brawls in Congress, his unleashment of an energy beam against the forces of slavery, and his epic sniper duel to the death against John Wilkes Booth. 
 The Chronicles of Theodore ""Badass Motherfucker"" Roosevelt. Details the life of American President Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt. Chapters include him punching his own heart condition back into health, an incredibly sorrowful chapter regaling the death of his wife and mother, his time in the West as a sharpshooting cowboy, his cavalry charge against energy weapons, his feud with the New York mob bosses during his tenure as NYPD commissioner, his ascension to Omega status with the death of McKinley, him tanking a hailfire of bullets during his inaugral speech, a boxing match to the death against a grizzly bear during his presidency that resulted in him being blinded in one eye, and his eventual epic duel with death himself11. 
 Addendum 4001-B1: Cataloging Assistance System 
 On ██/██/20██, a team of researchers and engineers completed the construction of a system which would enable easier access to the archives. Due to the sheer size of the archives, many days or even weeks of travel were required to locate older books. Thus, the Cataloging Assistance System was installed. 
 In order to use the Cataloging Assistance System, users should follow these steps:

 SCP-4002-J was re-coverdale-d on a dairy farm in █████, Wisconsin, following reports on a maisie-ve out-brie-ak of ""cheese induced aragon-ments"". Unaware of the ef-fetas, the recovery team was exposed to the me-meira-etic hazard. The team was later grated for their ambert-ure job in the field, and a-saga-igned as the provo-lone cleaning crew for that week. 
 This document is highly classified. It is not to go pasteurize. Upon further study, the ef-feta of SCP-4002-J goes beyond our initial conjecture. The current do-curd-mentation merely skims the surface of the object's true nature. Over time, the di-cheese grows expo-nantais-ly until speech with a lack-tose of dairy sarite-uration becomes unfeasible. As the object paneers a khoa-rizon of innes-fection, its ef-feta extends beyond cheese and en-comte-passes the whole of dairy. It is now abbaye-parent that we have no whey of comte-aining SCP-4002-J as it approaches this pont. What goudas a re-friesla-tor do against an accelerating me-meira-tic plague?

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to the relatively recent discovery and widespread habitat of SCP-4055-J, full containment is not possible at this time. Domestication attempts are to continue as a Septem-level priority to the Foundation. 
 Description: SCP-4055-J is an extremely hostile breed of dog. Its diet consists of garbage and it has a hairless, prehensile tail. SCP-4055-J instances regard humans with extreme contempt and will violently resist all attempts of domestication. 
 When given basic commands of ""sit"" and ""fetch"", SCP-4055-J instances will either feign death or attack their master. One specimen, upon hearing the phrase ""who's a good boy,"" proceeded to violently defecate on the floor while foaming at the mouth. 
 It is believed that a black market ring of dog breeders in association with the Serpent's Hand created SCP-4055-J through the hybridization of a chihuahua and an unknown canid/mollusk entity.1 The motive for this breed's generation is currently unknown, but is speculated to involve the discouragement of pet ownership as a form of slavery.

 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: When not being interacted with, SCP-4237-J is to be kept in Storage Compartment #5433. While interaction experiments with SCP-4237-J have resulted in few life-threatening incidents, all experiments involving SCP-4237-J must be done in a high-level Containment Unit. 
 Description: SCP-4237-J is a truncated icosidodecahedron (81 cm in diameter, 2.7 kg in weight) of unknown material. The surface is nominally hard and sharp-edged, with a submetallic lustre. SCP-4237-J has demonstrated the ability to deviate from these standards during manipulation; any alteration of SCP-4237-J's form simply 'works' as the manipulator expects or intends it to1, even if such intended manipulation is theoretically impossible. 
 It is impossible for any person interacting with SCP-4237-J to describe, in words or thoughts, precisely what SCP-4237-J does when one interacts with it. Subjects (and, if applicable, people observing others interacting with SCP-4237-J) find themselves unable to describe what SCP-4237-J did. Users find themselves increasingly frustrated as they attempt to articulate their interaction with SCP-4237-J, generally using analogies, neologisms, or portmanteaus in order to make their point. This inability occurs even if users attempt to recall interactions at a later date. 
 Attempts to have a passive Observer define events (such as details for this report) fail, with each individual inventing their own descriptions for events. In general, subjects feel a sense of entertainment or pleasure in the activities they perform with SCP-4237-J, despite their inability to verbalize the actions in a rational way. 
 Addendum 4237-A: Initial Interaction Experiments (D-Class)
Please note: Due to the nature of SCP-4237-J, this report will use written or audio reports from the User. These are unedited, with the exception of removing guttural exclamations of frustration with being unable to define events.

Nothing else happened, no matter which side I tapped on, so I started to all-you-see-is-a-wall with it. It burned like plant food when I tried it, but that's when you guys got mad. I apologize for what I did next, but no harm done, right? It acted like R████ W██████'s worst experiment when I did it on your guy, and then you guys knocked me out. 
 Subject: D-645
Duration of Interaction: 5 Minutes
Subject's Report: 
 I saw the object, and was told to interact with it. Didn't really know what to do with it. I mean, it wasn't anything special. I slapped it around a bit, and could you believe it, it werged like you wouldn't believe! I just sort of watched it as it orbpulsed a bit, when the thought struck me to stick my finger in the middle of it. It started to whizgurn like a motherfucker, around my finger, skimmying around me! It was then I started to get worried, 'cause… things don't lorb like that! Got worse when the parts started to sunshine between each other. It smellburned so lanterny for a while, so I just enjoyed its whirlpuzzling. After a while, it kooped up like normal. 
 Subject: D-12324
Duration of Interaction: 10 Minutes
Subject's Report: 
 I saw the thing, and since I was in a bad mood, I decided to just smash the damned thing with my foot. It hurt, but it made me feel better. I guess my foot is stronger than I thought, because I pitted it really well. Now in my mind, I'm thinking ""Huh, that looks like a twirl."" So I picked it up, and I was able to get it floatlatched. Made me feel like a goddamned genius, being able to do that. I found I could skim it a bit and keep the corb there. I struged it to the other, and got 'em both to hurling. Did that a couple dozen times. Have to admit, that was really awesome. Made me feel like a goddamned Spinnist. But then the higher-ups told me to leave, it got me mad. So I clanged the whole horb down and it all smucked back up into one thing. 
 Subject: D-645
Duration of Interaction: 30 Minutes
Subject's Report: 
 To be honest, I think you guys picked a bad guy to experiment with this thing. I mean, I didn't do much. I held the thing for a while, juggled it a bit, when the entire thing went jupiter core on me! After thinking it was gonna foom, I realized that each of the sides could be turned into donuts. Not the eating kind, the kind you fly in. Each one was a different brand of pastry, though, so some of them swam while others burned. There were a handful, though, that were the kind you drank, although I didn't. You only drink those things when you're purple, after all. I took advantage of all the goods to make a game for myself, using the flying-foods to make the swim-foods burn. Once I got them all - which wasn't easy, since the drinking donuts kept turning into Europe - they told me to stop. They got a bit mad at me for cleaning up all the dings before I left, but I've always felt it important to clean up after myself.

Observer's Report: 
 Subject D-892 sat down next to SCP-4237-J. Taking it in his hands, he proceeded to grater it into approximately seventy chings. Explaining that he was planning on ""Horning The Skermers"", Subject clayed up each ching, then Trofflestamped the lot. The chings reacted crommley at first, but then began to parallax for homefeel. Subject seemingly enjoyed this, until the rate of crommification increased, leading to [DATA ASSUMED TO QUALIFY FOR REDACTION]. The chings proceeded to wailsing, and then rebing themselves.

SCP-4263-J,"""Googly Eyes""","""Item #: SCP-4263-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-4263-J are stored at Site-██. Mobile Task Force Eta-29(Retro-Fitters) has been formed to search all gag shops, party stores, and craft stores for uncontained instances of SCP-4263-J and SCP-4263-1-J. All SCP-4263-1-J instances are to be stored in Researcher Ryan's quarters.1 
 Description: SCP-4263-J are crude plastic representations of eyes, with abnormally large black pupils that move freely behind a transparent plastic shield. 78% of people exposed to this movement describe it as ""disturbing,"" ""annoying,"" or ""creepy."" On most, the back is covered by an adhesive gum. 
 When two instances of SCP-4263-J are attached to an inanimate object (hereafter referred to as SCP-4263-1-J), roughly 90% of subjects have perceived said object as a sentient, and in some cases, sapient, creature. Regardless of the perceived disposition of the SCP-4263-1-J instance, many subjects will express a fascination with it, of varying strength, and attempt to ingratiate themselves with it. Those more severely affected by this interest will devote large amounts of time to both collecting and creating more SCP-4263-1-J instances. When questioned, subjects will insist that the creation of SCP-4263-1-J is an art form comparable to the Mona Lisa, The Thinker, etc. After several years of extensive testing, this hypothesis has been proven to be in error. 
 Addendum 01: Notable Test Logs 
 SCP-4263-J-1: A clock.
Results: Pupils of SCP-4263-J oscillated in time with the ticking of the clock. Overall effect described as ""hypnotic."" 
 SCP-4263-J-1: A sock.
Results: Unlike most instances of SCP-4263-1-J, result required manipulation by a human hand to manifest effect. Subject was compelled to relay the apparent thoughts of the instance in a high-pitched, cheerful voice. See Interview Log 4263-01. 
 SCP-4263-J-1: A rock.
Results: Subject behaved as though SCP-4263-1-J was a domesticated animal of some sort. Demonstrated positive emotional growth after being allowed to ""take care"" of it for several weeks.
Notes: Massive containment breach instigated by affected researcher. Mitigation was partially successful following the 1970's. Recontainment efforts are ongoing. All records of 1970-1979 are stricken from official Foundation records out of shame. 
 Interview Log 4263-01
In the interval between manifestation and the interview, researchers had provided SCP-4263-J, hosted by D-4263-7, with a blonde wig and lipstick. Resultant entity identified as ""Miss Agatha Williamson Chesterfield,"" and was considered by most subjects who viewed her to be ""a total knockout."" 
 Researcher Ryan: Hello, Miss Chesterfield.
SCP-4263-1-J: Oh, please, doctor! There's no need to be so formal! Call me Agatha! Or Aggie!
(Note that Researcher Ryan appears slightly flustered.)

(At this point, Researcher Ryan appears to be sweating)
Researcher Ryan: Well, if there's anything we can do for you..
SCP-4263-1-J: Actually, there is. My friend here, you know him as D-4263-7, was wondering if he could go out to get a bite to eat. He's bashful, you see, around someone as handsome as you, so he asked me to ask for him.

On ██/██/████, two instances of SCP-4263-J were attached to a D-class posterior. Resulting SCP-4263-J-1 instance was declared a Keter-Class entity. Despite this, no effort was made to contain it, with several researchers instead electing to create posters and other artwork depicting SCP-4263-J-1 and perpetuating a slogan which appeared to evolve by memetic consensus: ""Can't contain this Keter ass."" As of ██/██/████, Keter Ass has been successfully contained in a pair of sweatpants, rendering the slogan false.

 SCP-4297 (+75)

SCP-4714 (+53) 
 Item #: SCP-4297-J 
 Object Class: Apollyon 
 Special Containment Procedures: The Australian government1 is cooperating with the Foundation to contain SCP-4297-J. Containment of SCP-4297-J is currently unfeasible due to its ubiquity throughout the continent, as well as its primary anomalous effect. Should SCP-4297-J threaten civilian settlements, Mobile Task Force Tau-19 (""Apollyon Wanna Cracker"") is tasked with luring them into uninhabited areas. 
 Mobile Task Force Gamma-9 (""Vegemighty"") is responsible for maintaining distribution of amnestic-laced foodstuffs to grocery stores throughout the Australian continent to ensure that knowledge of SCP-4927-J fails to spread. 
 Description: SCP-4297-J is the designation for D. novaehollandiae, commonly known as emus.2 Instances of SCP-4297-J are capable of communicating among themselves,3 and are highly intelligent.4 
 Instances of SCP-4297-J typically utilize their beaks and feet to grasp and manipulate objects, often in conjunction with their claws; however, despite being observed by numerous members of MTF Gamma-9, this phenomenon has yet to be captured on video.5 
 SCP-4297-J is capable of using memetic, antimemetic, infohazardous, cognitohazardous, patahazardous6, and [DATA DOUBLE-EXPUNGED] anomalies to thwart Foundation attempts to contain it. It is believed that SCP-4297-J could possess the capability to disguise itself as other organisms to conceal its presence (see Incident 4927-J.5).7 
 Instances of SCP-4297-J are capable of reproduction with other SCP-4297-J instances or non-anomalous emus, generating eggs (designated SCP-4297-J-1). Similarly to non-anomalous emus,8 SCP-4297-J instances can each lay between 20 and 50 eggs per season, about 30-40% of which are fertilized and hatch new instances of SCP-4297-J. 
 The remaining instances of SCP-4297-J-1 are unfertilized. Experimentation logs for SCP-4297-J-1 are available from the Biological Site-231 cafeteria to all personnel between the hours of 0600 and 1200.9 
 SCP-4297-J show great resistance to Foundation containment and extermination efforts. More recently, however, SCP-4297-J instances have adopted guerrilla tactics, blending in with non-anomalous emus for protection and using their natural speed to escape if disarmed or wounded. 
 Discovery: SCP-4297-J was discovered in 1932 when Australian soldiers were sent to aid farmers in an effort to clear the emu population from their land, only to be forced to return due to malfunctioning equipment- believed to be caused by a probability-altering effect. Suspecting fowl play, the Foundation was contacted and attempted to ███████ ████ ██ █ ███ ██. Despite overwhelming superiority, ███ ███ ██ ████, ███████ ██ ███ all-consuming █████ ██ ███ █ ███, ██arp beaks to viciously castrate █████ ██. ██████ ██ ███ ████ ███ Australia's unconditional surrender. 
 Incident 4927-J.5: On 21 October 1953, Foundation aerial reconnaissance discovered a previously undetected colony of emus numbering over 6,000 instances contained within a vast fenced expanse in Western Australia, believed to have been run by an unknown GoI with hostile intent. 
 In light of the imminent violation of the Veil Protocol, O5 Command voted 12-1 in favor of eliminating the SCP-4297-J and GoI personnel using a 10kT yield nuclear bomb. Operation DROWNED RATITE was conducted with the cooperation of the GOC and the Australian government under the guise of British nuclear testing. Following [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5 COMMAND] 
 The SCP Foundation has issued a formal apology to the former staff of Brian's Ostrich Sanctuary.1011

SCP-4357-J,"""Cooperative Demon""","""Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4357-J is currently contained within a cylindrical space defined by a circular pattern of esoteric glyphs written on the floor in red and white chalk, 2.4 m in diameter. This design is furthermore surrounded by a square cage measuring 5m x 5m x 4m, composed of cold-wrought iron and inscribed with glyphs similar to those written in the inner circle. The cage is surrounded by a hexagram composed of sea-salt and silver dust. 
 Any personnel directly interacting with SCP-4357-J must have the symbols of at least 3 different religions clearly visible on their person at all times, and must be devout in one of them. They should carry a spray bottle or mister filled with purified water that has been blessed by an ordained clergy-member of the individual's faith. If SCP-4357-J becomes uncooperative or hostile, personnel are authorized to spray it with the water in order to provoke compliance. 
 Description: SCP-4357-J is a red-skinned humanoid standing 3 meters tall and massing approximately 200 kilograms. It has a barbed tail, two leathery wings emerging from its shoulderblades, and two curved, sharpened horns immediately above its eyes. It is naked, but does not possess any visible primary or secondary sexual characteristics. SCP-4357-J constantly emits heat in the range of 40-50 degrees Celsius, and occasionally as high as 95 degrees when angered. It does not appear to require food or sleep and is in an almost-constant state of agitation. It frequently insults staff members' intelligence and skill, specifically citing their incompetence in containing it.

 Agent ████████: Please identify your purpose here. 
 SCP-4357-J: Fuck you, man! You don't know me, you don't know what I am, you don't know what I can do! Hell, you don't even know how to keep me here! I mean, what are you, amateurs? You don't even have any holy water with you! How the hell are you supposed to drive me back if I decide to attack you! 
 Agent ████████: I see. Please wait here. Someone will return shortly. 
 06/07/19██ 
 Agent █████, a devout Catholic: Please remain at least 10 feet from me or I'll spray you. 
 SCP-4357-J: Dumbfuck. You think these wings are just for show? I could fly over and rip your throat out before you could pull that trigger. Shit, man, where's the goddamned summoning circle? Or the protective hexagram? You guys don't know jackshit. Hell, go get me some chalk and I'll show you myself! 
 Agent █████: That seems like a good idea. 
 Agent █████ leaves the containment chamber and returns 35 minutes later with a box of white chalk sticks. He hands the box to SCP-4357-J, who immediately proceeds to spend the next 15 minutes rapidly creating the pattern currently used for containment. 
 SCP-4357-J: And THAT is how you make a proper summoning circle. All the runes in place, everything nice and neat. NOW, if I step in it like this, it'll be hard for me to get out! 
 SCP-4357-J tries to step out of the circle and bumps against an unseen barrier. 
 SCP-4357-J: Oh, FUCK ME! 
 07/13/19██ 
 SCP-4357-J had, unusually for it, spent 3 hours crouched at the center of the containment ring, occasionally reaching forward to tap the barrier with its claws. At 1734 hours, it suddenly leaped straight upwards, unfurling its wings as it rose. Upon reaching the ceiling 6 meters above, it dug its claws into the concrete and crawled along it, outside the perimeter of the containment ring. 
 SCP-4357-J: Hah! I thought those things only went up 15 feet or so. I'm free, suck-asses! 
 Agents ██████ and ███ run into the room, whereupon they use spray bottles to spritz SCP-4357-J with holy water until it returns to the interior of the original containment diagram. 
 SCP-4357-J: Shit! That hurts, motherfuckers! Doesn't matter much, though; I'll just jump out again. It's not like you can put up a cage that'll hold me, either. I can bust through anything other than wrought-iron that has the words of Solomon on it, and where the unholy fuck are you going to find THAT nowadays, huh? 
 07/14/19██ 
 Foundation metalworkers install a wrought-iron cage under the supervision and blessing of Rabbi ███████ 
 SCP-4357-J: Shit. 
 10/01/19██ 
 Rabbi ███████: Are you any more agreeable today, demon? 
 SCP-4357-J: Hey, I'm doing fine, pork-breath. You cocksuckers are the ones with a problem. Blood and brimstone, you fuckers couldn't even build the cage right! I've been testing it and I could rattle it apart and get free before you dickheads could even get in here with that thrice-be-damned holy water! 
 Rabbi ███████: But what about the words of Solomon? They command you to stay. 
 SCP-4357-J: Oh, for fuck's sake, Rabbi Pigfucker. You of all people should know that the Seal of Solomon is a hexagram. No star to hold me and I can run wild as soon as you motherfuckers turn your backs! 
 Rabbi ███████: We have plenty of chalk, demon. I wager that I can draw a Seal before you could escape. 
 SCP-4357-J: Rabbi, Rabbi, Rabbi. I'm actually disappointed in your stupidity. You really think that chalk is good enough to hold a Seal? Why do you think all those back-wood fuckstains talk about using salt and silver to hold back the monsters in the dark? They're remembering us, and what drives us back. 
 Rabbi ███████: Thank you, demon. You've been… educational, as always. 
 SCP-4357-J: FUCK! No, wait, forget I said that! I was, uh, lying! Yeah! That's us demons, always lying our asses off! Can't trust a word we say! 
 12/19/19██ 
 Agent ██, devout Buddhist: Hello, SCP-4357. I have a question for you today. 
 SCP-4357-J: Fuck off, asshole. I ain't saying nothing to you shitheads any more. You keep locking me down tighter. 
 Agent ██: This is actually a very simple question that has been bothering me for a while: why didn't you escape before we set up all this? 
 Agent ██ gestures at the then-current containment protocols. SCP-4357-J looks stricken, with its mouth hanging open, for approximately 30 seconds. 
 SCP-4357-J: I- I didn't- I thought tha- Oh, GOD DAMN IT! 
 SCP-4357-J proceeds to throw itself against the containment barriers more violently than usual for 90 hours, 17 minutes, yelling a constant stream of invective the entire time.

SCP-4389-J,"""Can the Foundation do THIS?""","""Object Class: Euclid None 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4389-J is to be stored within a hermetically sealed containment chamber within Site-19. Entry and exit from the chamber must be prohibited, as they could lead to a containment breach. Any personnel with a Level-4 or higher security clearance should remain unaware of the existence of SCP-4389-J to prevent its antimemetic effect from manifesting. SCP-4389-J does not require containment, as it does not exist. 
 Description: SCP-4389-J is a powerful antimemetic anomaly, which is believed to have the physical form of a piece of medieval artillery. SCP-4389-J presents no signs of sentience; however, its antimemetic properties necessitate a Euclid classification. 
 The anomalous effect of SCP-4389-J varies in potency depending on how long a member of personnel has been employed at the Foundation. Junior Researchers and D-Class personnel are unable to observe SCP-4389-J, but accept its existence when made aware of it. However, Site Directors and members of the Overseer Council both cannot perceive SCP-4389-J and refuse to believe that it exists. For this reason, testing of SCP-4389-J should only be carried out by Junior Researchers. 
 Dr. Rossi,
 
It has become apparent that you (and several of your colleagues) believe that there is a certain antimemetic entity being contained in Site-19. This is not correct. There is nothing in the containment chamber which is seemingly designed to hold SCP-4389-J. Testing of other members of personnel who support the existence of SCP-4389-J has even revealed that there is no memetic or mind-altering component in this belief; you have come to this incorrect conclusion entirely using your own free will.
 
There is nothing within that containment chamber, anomalous or not. This does not mean SCP-4389-J has breached containment, as something cannot breach containment if it does not actually exist. I have previously sent this email to several other Junior Researchers who all refuse to admit that SCP-4389-J is not real. They ignored the truth, so I am going to make it extremely clear in this message:

SCP-47-47-J,"""Rusty the Wonder Dog""","""Item #: SCP-47-47-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-47-47-J should be kept indoors within a secure animal enclosure at Site-20. Although SCP-47-47-J appears to benefit from interaction with humans, for security and productivity reasons, this should be kept to a level commensurate with reasonable security practices, as determined by the Security Director of Site-20. Minimal attention is otherwise necessary to prevent a containment breach, provided the SCP Object does not come into contact with snow. 
 SCP-47-47-J should be provided with a source of water, 16 ounces of a 1:1 mix of dry kibble and wet dog food per day, and walked as needed. Joints around the neck and non-flexible portions of the legs should be cleaned and lubricated once a month. When not being exercised, SCP-47-47-J appears content to pace around its enclosure or sleep. 
 For the protection of SCP-47-47-J, any strings, yarn, or similar should be kept out of its enclosure. 
 In the event of accidental containment breach during exercise periods, personnel are encouraged to crouch low to the ground and make kissing noises while holding treats. 
 Note that some individuals consider SCP-47-47-J ""cute"". Extensive testing has uncovered no evidence that this is the result of an anomalous memetic effect. Individuals who seriously believe themselves to be compromised by SCP-47-47-J's expression, behavior, or physical appearance, especially those eyes, should report to their site's Psychologist for evaluation. 
 Under no circumstances is SCP-47-47-J to be allowed outside when there is snow on the ground. In the event that this occurs, SCP-47-47-J will slowly walk forward in a straight line discharging its energy weapons. Containment Teams are instructed to maneuver around behind the SCP-Object, approach it stealthily from behind, and lift it by the torso until such time as its paws are no longer in contact with the ground. Although it is difficult to discourage SCP-47-47-J from at least attempting to go outside when snow is present, scolding seems a sufficient means of reprimand following such an incident. 
 Description: SCP-47-47-J is an autonomous plastic entity superficially resembling an AT-AT from the Star Wars franchise of films, crossed with a puppy. The word ""Rusty"", in a child's handwriting, is written in permanent marker on a panel near the back of its torso. Although the torso, feet, and portions of joints on the legs are rigid and appear more or less mechanical in nature, the head, tail, and the remainder of the legs are quite flexible and can appear organic in the right light. Morphological sex characteristics, if any, have not been discovered yet, but DNA suggests that the dog portions of the SCP Object are male. 
 When threatened or backed into a corner, or when allowed to walk outdoors when snow is on the ground, SCP-47-47-J's fangs retract to reveal a tiny pair of turrets vaguely consistent with those shown on AT-ATs in the Star Wars films. These weapons have been shown to be dangerous, but are usually non-lethal, resulting in, at worst, second degree burns consistent with thermal exposure. Turrets fire as a pair in short, rapid bursts in response to duress, or alternating in a slower, continual stream of shots while walking through the snow. 
 Partial dismantling of SCP-47-47-J's torso cover exposes a flexible plastic underneath, similar to the material comprising the legs. Surgical exploration of the soft plastic reveals a network of hollow tubes continually pumping blood throughout the body. Blood was DNA tested and determined to be a hitherto unidentified subspecies of Canis lupus familiaris. Close examination of the turrets reveals no barrels or mechanisms; they appear to be molded from a solid piece of plastic consistent with the torso shell. 
 SCP-47-47-J has not been observed to urinate or defecate, but its flatulence is noted to be particularly offensive. 
 Recovery Log: Oh, it was sad. It was really, reeeeealllly sad. Imagine a kid dying from cancer. Imagine this kid wishing for a puppy for christmas more than anything, but getting some dumb star wars toy instead. The kid wishes on a star or something, maybe makes a deal with the devil or whatever, and presto. The toy is now a dog. Not two weeks later, Foundation Agents kick in the door, incapacitate both the kid's parents with tasers right in front of him, kick the kid in the junk and steal his dog. They also step on the kid's science fair project on the way out of the house, as if out of spite. Three days later, the kid, having lost the will to live, crawls to Old Dan's grave and, shedding a single tear, breathes his last. He dies with his eyes still open, and his parents don't find the body for three days. 
 It was just like that. Only WAY sadder. You should be ashamed of yourself.""",,+116,active,animal canine joke safe scp toy vehicle weapon,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-47-47-j
SCP-4800-J,"""The One True God""","""Item #: SCP-4800 
 Object Class: Fruity 
 Containment Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Once per day, an adult rhinoceros loyal to the Foundation is to be tranquilized in order to attack SCP-4800, thus keeping it occupied so it does not interact with Foundation personnel. This is to be repeated until SCP-4800 leaves the Noosphere. 
 Description: SCP-4800 is a memetic entity currently residing within the Noosphere. When viewed, SCP-4800 takes the form of a banana with anthropomorphic arms, legs, and facial features. This is not SCP-4800's true form, and is believed to be the human mind's attempt to rationalize what is an imperceptible entity. 
 SCP-4800 will normally appear in the dreams of Foundation personnel, interacting in ways meant to disturb or otherwise interfere with the mental state of the dreamer. Quotes from Foundation personnel regarding SCP-4800 are listed below. 
 I was having a dream where I was playing baseball with my kid, and he said ""I love you dad"" and hugged me. Then he asked me if I was truly fulfilled with my life, and when I opened my eyes I saw the banana man hugging me again. - Researcher Calvin 
 In my dream, I was filling out my Form 1040. SCP-4800 repeatedly tried to force me to understate my income, thus committing tax fraud. - Dr. Gears 
 So there was this dream, where I was in a padded room with him, and he described the details on the inside of my intenstines for three hours straight. To be honest, I kind of liked it. - Agent Albert 
 He pissed on my fucking wife; I saw the banana man rip out his massive banana dick and take a massive piss on her. A rhino isn't enough; do you think we can shove SCP-4975 in the dream world? - Dr. Gregory 
 I think I saw him kill God. - Dr. Barney 
 It is believed that SCP-4800 originates from beyond our timeline; possibly in some alternate universe where bananas evolved to become the Earth's dominant species instead of man. 
 Event Designation EE-4800 
 Date of Occurrence: October 10th, 2019 
 Event Description: At 16:20 PM PST, the Moon began to emit an intense yellow light. SCP-4800 was visible in the moon's reflection. The entirety of humanity began to undergo intense structural transformations and grew peel-like structures from their back. Entities experienced growth of cell walls and development of potassium glands. 
 MTF Beta-7 (""Literal Sentient Bananas"") has now been assigned to the containment of SCP-4800. 
 After EE-4800 occurred as described above, personnel at Site-05 received the following message. 
 My work here is done. I am going to banana split out of here. 
 Shortly after, Foundation personnel stationed on the Moon were suddenly transmitted an image file. The following image has been described as ""extremely disturbing"" and ""the reason why bad things happen"".

SCP-5040-J,"""Stripèd Gangs""","""Item #: SCP-5040-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: All specimens of SCP-5040-J are to be contained at Site-129. SCP-5040-J-1 specimens are to be housed on the east side of the Site, and SCP-5040-J-2 specimens are to be housed on the west side. Minimal cost is to be expended in containing and feeding all specimens of SCP-5040-J, but it is of utmost importance that two groups be kept separated. 
 Although isolated populations of SCP-5040-J are widespread in developed countries, their tendency to accidentally trap themselves in small invisible boxes should make them quite easy to remand into containment en masse. Major Mimes-1 through -28 are to be the primary targets for containment. 
 Researcher's Note: Well, we were wrong about THAT. Major Mime-11 has been lost, and with him nearly the entire North American supply of white gloves and black berets. 
 Description: SCP-5040-J is an abnormal extant subspecies of late-modern hominid, likely descended from Central European haplotypes. Specimens exhibit a gracile body type, dark hair, and extremely pale skin coloration with odd black markings on the face. All specimens are mute, communicating with an unnervingly fluid manner of body language that has yet to be translated. The reason for their silence continues to elude Foundation research. 
 Specimens of SCP-5040-J possess telekinetic abilities which are present from adolescence. These manifest as the willful creation of seemingly invisible objects with which only SCP-5040-J can interact. Typical instances of these objects take the forms of ropes, weights, and gusts of wind. SCP-5040-J display a high degree of control over the creation of their objects. On rare occasions, their abilities turn against them, causing them to become stuck behind invisible walls or inside of invisible boxes. 
 Culturally, SCP-5040-J has divided into two major gangs, each comprised of over 3000 members worldwide. SCP-5040-J-1, ""the Zigs,"" wear garments designed with black stripes on white, while SCP-5040-J-2, ""the Zags,"" wear clothing covered with white stripes on black. While it is apparent that the objects they create are unable to affect normal matter, members of each gang frequently use their telekinetic abilities to injure and kill members of the other gang in petty disputes. The most common areas of conflict between SCP-5040-J-1 and SCP-5040-J-2 revolve around street corner territory, available females, and valuable resources such as gloves and berets that remain scarce in a post-Mime-11 world. 
 Addendum: What follows is the transcript of a crudely taped video address given by a delegate from SCP-5040-J-1 to Foundation personnel. 
 (SCP-5040-J-1-M salutes with an odd hand gesture.)
SCP-5040-J-1-M: ...!

(He faces the camera and pounds his fist into his palm.)

(He stops suddenly, looks up, and then cowers from something unknown above him that appears to be drawing closer.)
SCP-5040-J-1-M: ....! .......! .................!
(SCP-5040-J-1-M is squashed flat by a large invisible weight.)
(A specimen of SCP-5040-J-2 peers in from off screen and covers his mouth as though laughing.)
(Tape ends.) 
 Addendum: The Foundation has begun an ""F♯ Nordic-sememe""-class campaign to raise subliminal public awareness about the threat that an extended SCP-5040-J gang war would pose to humanity at large and all that is good and not annoyingly creepy.

SCP-5150-J,"""Think Of The Children""","""Item #: SCP-5150-J 
 Outrage Class: Unacceptable. 
 Steps for Crisis Prevention: SCP-5150-J needs to be stopped. It needs. To be stopped. 
 If you see your kids talking about it, start screaming. Don't stop screaming until they promise to never bring it up again. I'm serious. 
 At this point, it's probably for the better that we just don't let anyone outside until we know SCP-5150-J has been eradicated. Eradicate it. Stop reading this right now and eradicate SCP-5150-J. I don't care how much pepper spray you use, it needs to be stopped. I'm not kidding, Linda. 
 Description: SCP-5150-J is a truly horrible thing that the Society for Concerned Parents heard about from an Amazon review. It's a product that people are claiming is ""just a straw"", but look at the picture. Look at it. Straws don't do that. What happens if you drink something with it, and your drink has to go through a bunch of unnecessary circles? The answer: sexual promiscuity and autism. 
 And now kids are getting SCP-5150-J, and using them to drink. This is serious. Every kid in the inner city projects has one now. Every. Kid. Ev. Ery. Kid. What are they doing with all these straws? We have to ask these painful questions in order to keep the conversation going. Please take this seriously right now. 
 One can only imagine the true story: our kids are calling it ""Suck"" because they say that's what you do with a straw, but I think we know what it really means. They're using the different colors of straws to mean different kinds of sexual favors, and having horrible ""Suck Parties"" where everyone comes out pregnant and with bad grades, autism, and incurable face rashes. How do we know that this isn't what's happening? We can't take that chance. 
 Just yesterday I saw some perfectly nice boy outside the Wendy's the other day drinking a soda pop with one of those. I took a good, long look at him. And you know what? No, shut up, Linda, my nerves are bad enough as is. Anyway - the boy, he has autism now. I mean it. I saw the look in his eyes, that dead, sinking feeling underneath them. 
 Then he looked at me and said (and I remember his words verbatim) ""Are you okay? You've been sitting in your car staring at me for the past seven minutes."" Those are the words of a boy who can't read social cues. Go find that boy, tell me I'm wrong. Because I'm not. 
 Addendum: I'm not wrong. For God's sake, Linda, I've home-birthed and raised two healthy, successful boys on kombucha and Tae Bo classes, and if you have the audacity to imply that I'm wrong, and that you're somehow a better mother than I am, I swear to God I will slash your tires.

SCP-5200-J is a feeling that you have to give in to what the cool kids are doing, or else you won't be cool, right? Giving into SCP-5200-J has many results, the most common being

SCP-5280-J,"""Antiquated Measurement System""","""Item #: SCP-5280-J 
 Object Class: Euclid-ubique 
 Special Containment Procedures: Subjects found using SCP-5280-J are primarily located in the United States, Liberia, and (to a lesser extent) the United Kingdom and its commonwealths; these areas collectively comprise SCP-5280-J's primary containment area. While this area is inherently nonsensical, it has been deemed safe for habitation by civilians and personnel. Instances of SCP-5280-J have been located outside of containment in the past; however, these instances are not considered likely to spread SCP-5280-J due to its inferiority. 
 Containment of SCP-5280-J is focused on attempting to eliminate its use on a case-by-case basis; administration of Procedure 101010 (""Dope Slaps"") to subjects attempting to use SCP-5280-J is currently the most effective method of treatment. Repeated application of this procedure has been effective in curing subjects of habitual SCP-5280-J use in most cases; however, subjects raised in SCP-5280-J's primary containment area are, under most circumstances, incurable outside of scientific, technical, or otherwise professional contexts. 
 Description: SCP-5280-J is a contagious meme that is comprised of several closely related sets of units that, theoretically, are capable of being used to express length, area, capacity, and mass. However, experimentation has shown it to be highly impractical for these purposes. While the basic units of measurements for length and mass are not inherently irrational, conversions between different units of the same quantity is unnecessarily difficult due to the apparently random conversion factors involved. As of yet, SCP-5280-J has resisted all attempts at eradication. This is believed to be an inherent anomalous property compounded by the extent to which it had spread prior to classification. 
 SCP-5280-J had displayed several additional behaviors that the Foundation has deemed to be of concern, most notably: 
 Addendum: Further research has discovered several additional properties that have been deemed of note: 
 A request to upgrade SCP-5280-J to Keter has been denied due to the fact that SCP-5280-J is just a mildly annoying and irrational way of doing things that people take far too seriously.

SCP-5308-J,"""The Collection""","""Item #: SCP-5308-J 
 Object Class: Euclid/Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: The items collectively known as SCP-5308-J are to be kept in 5 meter x 5 meter underground rooms with steel walls no less than one meter in thickness, with a two-inch plating of Telekill alloy. The entrance to these vaults is to be guarded at all times by at least two hundred guards from special forces backgrounds, seventeen class-D personnel blinded and given flamethrowers, three priests, two rabbis, an imam, a Sherpa, and a Girl Scout of Abrahamic faith. Four separate onsite nuclear devices are to be detonated in the event of a security breach. 
 Description: SCP-5308-J is a collection of objects of unknown anomalous properties, which have to date eluded the best minds of the Foundation. A detailed description of each item follows. 
 SCP-5308-J-1: A perfectly cubical piece of granite twenty centimeters on a side, weighing nearly 20 kilograms. It was discovered by Agent ████ at a yard sale in ████ █████, ND, and immediately recognized as dangerously Platonic. Previous owner was unfortunately killed during the ensuing firefight. Fortunately, SCP-5308-J-1 survived to be placed into Foundation custody. Please see the experiment log for details on its anomalous properties. 
 Professor █████: ""Please approach the cube."" 
 D-3534: ""Uh, sure. Hey, why are you wearing that suit? Should… should I have a suit?"" 
 Professor █████: ""Make a note. Subject appears agitated. Memetic or psychic effect? 3534, Please pick up the cube."" 
 D-3534: ""Okay. Oof. Heavy sucker."" 
 Professor █████: ""Interesting. Gravity manipulation? How do you feel, 3534?"" 
 D-3534: ""Huh? Uh, fine, I guess."" 
 Professor █████: ""My god. It must be healing him."" 
 D-3534: ""What?"" 
 Professor █████: ""But at what cost? Look at his confusion. It's affecting his mind. D-3534, how do you feel about the cube?"" 
 D-3534: ""It's an okay cube, I guess."" 
 Professor █████: ""Put the cube down! Right now! Put the cube down!"" 
 D-3534 complies. 
 Professor █████: ""Take the shot! Now! While he's no longer in contact!"" 
 D-3534 is shot by five separate snipers simultaneously. 
 Professor █████: ""Thank god he put it down. If he'd still been holding the cube when we shot him, there's no telling what it could have done. I want his remains incinerated and the ashes bound into a concrete matrix, just to be sure."" 
 SCP-5308-J-2: A piece of paper with an anomalous reddish-brown stain. Analysis shows that the stain consists of human blood. Possible connections to SCP-███, SCP-███, and SCP-███ are suspected. The stain appeared shortly after SCP-5308-J-2 seemingly attacked Dr. █████, creating a small, straight cut on the tip of his finger. It should therefore be considered extremely dangerous and hostile. 
 Appeasing SCP-5308-J-2 is to be considered a class Alpha-One-Aleph priority. Should it make any demands known, they are to be filled out immediately and to the letter, short of allowing SCP-5308-J-2 to escape. 
 SCP-5308-J-3: A spayed female housecat with russet fur weighing approximately 3.5 kilograms. SCP-5308-J-3 was found near the entrance to one of the Foundation's fronts. Despite multiple interrogation attempts, it has yet to reveal what it was doing there. Analysis into its anomalous properties has been fruitless as yet (see Interview Log SCP-5308-J-3-2 for details). 
 Interview with Dr. ████████, Foundation Veterinarian. 
 Professor ██████: ""So, what's it made of?"" 
 Dr. ████████: ""What do you mean?"" 
 Professor ██████: ""Is it made of bone?"" 
 Dr. ████████: ""No. Well, its skeleton is, but not the rest of it."" 
 Professor ██████: ""Is it made of blood?"" 
 Dr. ████████: ""No."" 
 Professor ██████: ""Is it made of… gravity?"" 
 Dr. ████████: ""No. How would that even work?"" 
 Professor ██████: ""Is it made of fire?"" 
 Dr. ████████: ""No. It's just made of, well, of cat."" 
 Dr. ████████ was later terminated in case of lingering mental influence by SCP 5308-J-3. 
 SCP-5308-J-4: A standard size ball-point pen containing what appears to be human blood. It was found in a desk in an abandoned factory in ██████, Saskatchewan. The origin of this blood-like substance is unknown. Under no circumstance is anyone to attempt to write with SCP-5308-J-4. Any personnel who attempts to do so will be terminated, and their surviving relatives assigned to Keter duty. 
 Addendum SCP-5308-J-4-14: Analysis has shown that the substance contained in SCP-5308-J-4 is heavily degraded ink. Object class has been changed to Euclid. 
 SCP-5308-J-5: A three-year-old male Caucasian child who answers to the name of ""Jerry."" It was found at a playground near Site-██, playing on a swingset. So far, it has been concluded that SCP-5308-J-5 is not bulletproof, fireproof, regenerative, stronger than average, or capable of commanding dangerous animals. Further tests are to be approved by Director ████████. 
 For the continued mental health of SCP-5308-J-5, a regular schedule of normal developmental activities is to be strictly enforced. Guards and researchers are to take particular note of Section 5b, ""Nap Time,"" and Section 7a, ""Hugs."" To help combat SCP-5308-J-5's ongoing behavioral issues, use positive phrases such as ""How's it going, slugger?"" ""Good going, Jerry!"" and ""Your parents are probably quite proud of you, if they're still alive.""""","""SCP-5308-J-3 at rest

At last, my genius has been recognized! I have been contacted by the Overseers1 to begin work on an SCP of extreme importance. Everything is hush hush, top secret, so I'll be keeping my notes secure here. I'm not even sure which Overseer has assigned me the project, it's that secret. I'll be at Site 4212 for the duration, and I have been assured SCP-260 has been handled. I'll write more when I get the time!

Whatever aspects make a person become even more prevalent, almost to the point of caricature. Copies are rather high strung, doing everything to the utmost they can, with great enthusiasm.
All this has already been proven and dealt with. What I am here for is to test the device on intelligent SCPs and Researchers. Apparently there are some of them they wouldn't mind replacing.5 
 ██/██/████:
Testing Log 1
Subject: SCP-953
Result: A tiny fox lady, near to bouncing off the walls with energy. Upon initial creation, she jumped on a D-Class, kissed him on the lips, shoved her claws through his nostrils, fondled his crotch, and then bit his throat out. She proceeded to massacre the other three D's in the testing room, before gas was applied. The remains were incinerated. Something more stable for the next one. 
 [PAGE MISSING] 
 Testing Log 7
Subject: SCP-076
Result: After the previous successes we decided to try a hard one. Mini-076 was an unmitigated disaster. He was created much closer to the original, entering a killing rage upon creation. The decrease in size resulted in an increase in speed, leaving us with something much like a cross between a bouncy ball and a Cuisinart. Mini-076 came close to breaking containment, however at the last moment the real 076 showed up, and took care of it. He rather forcefully made the point that such liberties would not be allowed to happen again. Luckily, my assistant Ryan took responsibility. I'll miss Ryan. Gonna call a halt to it for the day. 
 ██/██/████:
Testing Log 8
Subject: Dr. Rights
Result: Having failed rather horribly with the SCPs, I have decided to move on to my fellow researchers. Due in part to a crush I have upon said researcher, Rights was a perfect fit. And I have to say, even at a third the size, she is striking. Mini-Rights expressed interest in SCP-5555, and then proceeded to remove her clothes and seduce me, which I willingly allowed. 
 Note: And then she hit me in the head with a lamp while I attempted to enjoy the afterglow. 
 Note: Mini-Rights has breached containment. Security says they'll bring her back quickly. 
 Testing Log 9
Subject: Dr. Gears
Result: Mini-Gears is little more than a robot. He reacts to outside stimulus, responding to questions, but seems to show no curiosity, or outward will. A rather large wind up key in his back has no actual use. Mini-gears has been relegated to the incinerator. 
 Note: Somewhere between the testing lab and the incinerator, Mini-Gears vanished. One of our transports is also missing. Damn it! 
 Testing Log 10
Subject: Dr. Clef
Result: I told them no, I told them this one we should just leave, but nooo, I gotta try all the important researchers.
Where the FUCK did he get that shotgun from? I'm gonna go see Mini-590 about my legs, and hope Security can take the gun away. 
 Note: Need new security. Half of them dead or wounded, Mini-Clef nowhere to be found. 
 ██/██/████:
Testing Log 11:
Subject: Dr. Glass
Result: … Mini-Glass appears to be a large afro, wrapped in a scarf with a lap coat. Only his eyes are visible, and somehow, within minutes of his appearance, three kittens wormed their way into the testing room. He … he kinda freaks me out, being so cheerful. 
 Note: Security outside Mini-Glass's cell were found with their stomachs torn out from the inside, as if by something small and furry. Mini-Glass is still at large. 
 Testing Log 12:
Subject: Dr. Iceberg
Result: A small man in a lab coat, holding a briefcase. Upon creation, he immediately opened his briefcase and handed me a sheaf of papers, informing me I had to fill them out before progressing. The top sheet was 'Form 518b, A Request To Create New Life Based Upon Old Structures, In An Environment Unsuited For It,' and the bottom sheet was 'Form 8675309, Being A Total Twit In Public.' Mini-Iceberg was detained. 
 Note: This is getting ridiculous. Two security, found lacerated with paper cuts, and mini-Iceberg no where to be found. Although he did leave behind a properly filled out form, 'Form 24601, Request To Escape Foundation Custody In An Outlandish Manner.' 
 Note: That's it! Of course! These miniature versions are caricatures of the real thing! That's why they have clothes, and defining characteristics. I'll have to try this with someone who has an item they always… Bright, yes, that'll do. 
 Testing Log 13
Subject: Dr. Jack Bright
Result: A miniature orangutan, wearing SCP-963. Attempts to transfer 963 resulted in new wearer becoming a miniature orangutan. Removal of 963 brought back the wearer with no harm done. Mini-Bright remanded into custody. 
 Note: I am covered in monkey shit. Mini-Bright is at large. This day is over. 
 ██/██/████:
Testing Log 14:
Subject: Dr. Kondraki
Result: Decided to try one of the non powered again. Was not expecting this. Mini-Kondraki appears normal, except for the large pair of butterfly wings sprouting from his back, and the camera around his neck. Wings appear non functional. 
 Note: Saber hidden in camera. That fucker hurts. 
 Note:Wings are functional. No Mini is allowed access to an open air recess yard from here on out. Almost got him with the search light. 
 Testing Log 15
Subject: Dr. Palmer
Result: Easier to get along with than Rights, why not try? Resultant miniature appears to be Palmer, but facial recognition incapable due to being blocked by her chest. Dear god, how does she walk with those things? 
 Note: Mini-Palmer is not to be used as a flotation device. 
 Note: Or an airbag. 
 Note: Found guards passed out drunk. Mini-Palmer appears to have drugged them with a pill she had.. ahem.. stashed on her person. 
 Testing Log 16
Subject: Dr. L██████
Result: Don't know why I didn't think of it before! The perfect assistant for me is, of course, my self. Brilliant! Mini-L██████ is a little slow, and appears to have a weird skin rash that causes him to look reptilian, but otherwise perfect! I'm going to have him work on creating some new Minis, while I take a nap. What could go wrong? 
 Note: Mini-L██████ needed some help in working 5555, and used it upon himself. Mini-Mini-L██████ felt that the workload was too much, and he could use some help. Mini-Mini-Mini-L██████… By the time I got back to the lab there were 32 levels of L██████, each smaller than the next. All were assigned to be terminated, this was a bad idea. 
 Note: I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know. At least the guards say they used lube. Damnit. 
 ██/██/████:
Testing Log 17:
Subject: Kain Pathos Crow
Result: A cute little Labrador puppy in a bow tie. Acting under the supposition that the cuter the miniature, the more deadly they are, Mini-Kain was immediately transferred into a heavy metal box, and the lid sealed. 
 Note: Mini-Kain somehow managed to piss in both my shoes, while being transferred to the Box. That little fucker… Screw it, we're putting him down. 
 Note: Attendants assigned to put down Mini-Kain found with lethal injection needles inserted in their eyelids. And pissed on. The damn dog is nowhere to be found. 
 Testing Log 18
Subject: Dr. Snorlison
Results: I am getting really sick and tired of this. Really. Seriously. This is bullshit, I won't… Fuck it, I'm getting paid. Mini-Snorlison, has a gigantic mustache, and is wrapped in a parka. And, he won't shut up. I don't know how he has time to breathe, he just keeps talking. 
 Note: 5 hours later. He still won't stop. I want to shoot him, but I just can't. 
 Note: 8 hours since last note. I just woke up to find myself passed out on the floor of the lab, with a Sharpie mustache. Needless to say, Mini-Snorlison got out. 
 ██/██/████:6
It's over. I've been removed from working on SCP-5555, and returned to active duty. Everyone else here at Site ██ seems to think I was on vacation, and I'm not going to tell them differently. 
 See, I think I figured it out. Four 5's wasn't creating these miniatures out of whole cloth. It was pulling them from another world entirely, one where everyone is like them. But it only works one way. What I think happened is one of them got himself stuck here, and used the Foundation, and me, to bring some of his friends across. That's why they all got away, there was already one here looking out for them. How do I know this? 
 My dismissal orders were signed 'Mini-O5-6.' 
 I'm going to go lie down and hope maybe SCP-260 will find me before anyone finds out what I've done.78 
 The files end there 
 *Audio Log CLF-666, recorded from personal office of Dr. Clef* 
 Clef: So you want to be my assistant? 
 Unknown: KILL… kill kill kill. 
 Clef: Very good. Well, aside from being a miniature clone of me, what are your credentials? 
 Unknown: MAIM! MURDER! SLAY! DESTROY! 
 Clef: I see. Well, I'm very impressed. You can start on Monday. 
 Unknown: DEATH TO THE INFIDELS! 
 From the personal log of Dr L██████: 
 ██/██/████:
It has been brought to my attention that with the passing of the Maxi version of myself, we have no one to work SCP-5555. And the only one with any experience with it, is, well, myself. As such, O5-6 has assigned me the duty of bringing across more of our comrades, and documenting it in the same format as Maxi-L██████. Joy. 
 Anyways, I have been given an official list to bring across, immediately. O5-6 has requested me to bring over Bijhan (for something secret), Site Director Fat Ghost (to take care of our own SCP site), Pat Gephart (our network is down), Dr. Blast (cause we always need more explosions), and… No, this one can't be right, let me check… 
 Apparently, Carrion Trooper. For the lulz. 
 Testing Log 20
Subject: Maxi-Bijhan
Result: Bijhan is a fairly typical looking Arabic man, taller than most at a full 1m (3ft,3in). He wears a black robe and a white turban, wherein he keeps his weaponry. Shortly after his appearance, I noticed I was missing my pen, SCP-5555, and my pants. When confronted, Bijhan was more than glad to return them to me. 
 Note: How the hell did he manage to walk off with my desk? That thing is three times his size! 
 Testing Log 21
Subject:Maxi-Fat Ghost
Result:
Note: I don't know, I don't want to know, this issue is closed. 
 Testing Log 22
Subject: Maxi-Pat Gephart
Result: No indication given that 5555 worked. Attempted it again, only to get a fail message. Will look into it. 
 Note: Don't worry man, I'm here. But since I'm dealing with these here computers, you all got no reason to see me. I'm gonna stay here, where it's safe. And no, I ain't tellin you where 'here' is. 
 Testing Log 23
Subject: Maxi-Blast
Result: Blast showed up dressed as usual. A thin layer of black soot covers his skin and clothes, all his hair burned off and his clothes in burnt tatters. 
 Note: Who authorized giving Blast chewing gum and water? That explosion nearly leveled the play room! 
 Testing Log 24
Subject: Maxi-Carrion Trooper
Result: Log Corrupted, see picture. 
 Note: That's it, I'm done. 
 From the personal log of Dr. C███████, 6/30/20██: 
 Found something really neat today. Big dusty box. With a thing in it: SCP-5555. Renders its input tiny, round, and extreme. This is my chance to prove I'm not useless. Work immediately! 
 Test Log 01 (6/30/20██, 3:40 PM)
Input: Research Assistant Renfield
Output: Tiny female with blonde pixie cut, one square lens on glasses, and white turtleneck. Output exited SCP-5555, leaned over my notes, picked up my pen to correct them, and was immediately accidentally decapitated by freak fracture of pen nib.
Note: I don't get it. 
 Test Log 02 (6/30/20██, 4:00 PM)
Input: Senior Researcher Gerald
Output: Tiny red-haired male, dressed in a lab coat, with driving goggles and a very long ascot. Remarkably, Mini-Gerald came with his own vehicle, what appears to be a shriner car. A really simple little thing, battery operated. Mini-Gerald seemed unwilling to talk, and instead drove the vehicle around my lab, making 'Vroom vroom' noises.
Note: As I complied my experience, Mini-Gerald drove out the door, accelerating at speeds I was not aware such vehicles could make. I followed quickly, but lost site of him when he turned the corner into Zeta wing. I heard an explosion, and lost track of the mini during the resulting Keter outbreak. 
 Test Log 03 (7/02/20██, 4:00 PM)
Input: Dr. Light
Output: Tiny female in lab coat, with a small metal briefcase labeled ""Totally not full of samples of infectious diseases"". Carried what looked like a helium-filled jellyfish on a string.
Note: Jellyfish balloon was cute, but it sure could sting. Ended today's testing to visit Site infirmary. Must remember to ask cleaning staff how to get smashed medusa out of carpet.
Note: Infirmary was already busy when I arrived. Apparently there have been simultaneous outbreaks of dengue fever, Marburg virus, and smallpox, all within the site, all within the last half-hour. No sign of Mini-Light. 
 Test Log 04 (7/03/20██, 11:00 AM)
Input: Agent Yoric Elroy
Output: 3-foot-long rattlesnake.
Note: What the fuck? Okay, this has to be a mistake. Got the snake under control, going to try again. 
 Test Log 05 (7/03/20██, 1:00 PM)
Input: Agent Yoric Elroy
Output: Tiny male in chinos, a waistcoat, horn rim glasses and a cap of some sort. Headgear's precise features impossible to determine, other than the slogan printed on the front: ""Hey, Look over There?""
Note: Found myself looking away despite myself. While I was distracted, Mini-Yoric stole my wallet, replaced all the money with photos of his behind, and put it back.
Note: Mini-Yoric began to to critique my technique in handling SCP-5555-J. Three straight hours of this led me to leave the room in tears. When I returned, I found a bucket of SCP-447 placed over the door, when it spilled on me. No sign of Mini-Yoric.
Note: He took the snake too! 
 Test Log 06 (7/04/20██, 8:30 AM)
Input: Agent Dmitri Strelnikov
Output: Apparently, an animate round fur hat wearing heavy Russian army boots. Object revealed to be a tiny male when it lifted the hat to reveal enough nose and mouth to toss back a shot of vodka. Mini-Strelnikov speaks only in thickly-accented, semi-coherent ramblings, usually threats of harm.
Note: Where Agent Strelnikov despises Chechens, Mini-Strelnikov harbors a deep and murderous rage against chickens. This I learned after Mini-Yoric left me another surprise — a bucket of tar over my door, followed by a large basket of feathers. Turns out that Mini-Strelnikov is actually easier to understand when he's frothing at the mouth and chasing me with disproportionately huge knives, but I wish I hadn't heard what he was promising to do with them. 
 Test Log 07 (7/04/20██, 12:00 PM)
Input: Dr. King
Output: 412 pounds of apple seeds. I'm going to go have a lie down.
Note: I think something left the lab. A trail of apple seeds led to the compactor. 
 Test Log 08 (7/05/20██, 3:45 PM)
Input: Agent Karrin ""Break""
Output: Tiny Asian female, dressed in an immaculate black dress suit. She immediately headed straight to my coffee maker, where she proceeded to make the best damn cup of espresso I've ever tasted. And my machine doesn't even have an espresso maker!
Note: As I was drinking the coffee, the god damn little bitch shot me in both my knees with a crossbow! Where the hell did she get that from? I need a medic… 
 Test Log 9 (7/06/20██, 11:20 AM)
Input: Dr. C. “Photosynthetic” Elliott
Output: 3-foot-tall mound of plant matter, which upon prodding resolved into several dozen potted plants being carried by a tiny female in a green lab coat. Soon after touching the plants, I felt dizzy, and locked Mini-Photosynthetic in while I visited the Site infirmary. Again.
Note: Returned to my lab to find it completely swamped in plant growth. The things are toxic, and they bite. No sign of Mini-Photosynthetic. 
 Test Log 10 (7/07/20██, 12:00 PM)
Input: Dr Everett Mann
Output: Tiny male in a lab coat, with a gigantic mustache. The damned thing is almost tentacle like. And, for some reason, he has what appears to be a mind wiped Mini-D-class on a chain.
Note: Mini-Mann has been quite helpful in showing me how to really use the device. Apparently it even has a portable handle, makes this much easier! 
 Test Log 11 (7/07/20██, 1:00 PM)
Input: The disassembled pieces of Hatbot
Output: A rather smaller version of the robot in question, really cute, actually. Reminds me of one of those old cartoon robots, with the square heads. And, even funnier, it speaks entirely in Lolcat!
Note: Upon introducing Mini-Hatbot to Mini-Mann, M-H declared 'I can Haz your death?' drew a butcher knife from somewhere, and chased MM out of the room. Damn those buggers move fast. What the hell is going on? 
 Test Log 11 (7/07/20██, 5:00 PM)
Input: Agents Dodridge and Lament
Output: Making use of the new found portable aspect of SCP-5555-J, I was able to snag both agents at once! The results were… interesting. Both minis showed an increase in melanin to their skin, as well as a lightening of their hair, which seemed to be in permanent spikes. I will also note their collars absolutely refused to lay down.
Note: The two minis, after a long conversation, declared me to be a 'bro' and produced a mini-keg from somewhere, encouraging me to drink. These are some of the greatest people I have ever met, Mini or no.
Note: I woke up in a bathtub filled with ice. And dicks drawn on my face. I don't feel so good…
Note: The little bastards took BOTH my kidneys! 
 Test Log 12 (7/09/20██, 9:00 AM)
Input: SCP-542
Output: Tiny male Frankenstein's monster, minus the bolts. Chatted about politics for about ninety seconds, then whipped out a scalpel and went for my kidneys. I'm not sure whether or not to be glad that they were already missing. 
 Test Log 13 (7/09/20██, 11:30 AM)
Input: Myself (Dr. C███████)
Output: Tiny male carrying tiny Lego models of seventeen different SCP objects. He immediately stuck the tiny Lego 320 to the tiny Lego 682. When I came to, my lab was in shambles, but Mini-me was still there — scorched, sooty, and dazed, but grinning.
Note: I'm not sure whether to write down every word he says or lock him in a closet forever. 
 Test Log 14 (7/10/20██, 10:45 AM)
Input: Five instances of SCP-2558-J (""Sprinkles"", ""Marshmallow"", ""Mr. Tubbs"", ""Sparky"", and ""Lord Fluffykins"")
Output: Indistinguishable from input except that they mew in Japanese.
Note: I don't even know how that's possible. 
 Test Log 15 (7/10/20██, 11:50 AM)
Input: Five instances of SCP-2558-J (""Sprinkles"", ""Marshmallow"", ""Mr. Tubbs"", ""Sparky"", and ""Lord Fluffykins"")
Output: Tiny, adorable [DATA EXPUNGED] oh my God, I have never seen anything so precious in my life [DATA EXPUNGED] who's a sweetie little tubby-wubs, yes you are! [DATA EXPUNGED]
Note: I was lucky to escape with my life and faculties intact. Mini-C███████ was not so lucky. He will be missed. 
 Test Log 16 (7/11/20██, 9:00 AM)
Input: SCP-173
Output: Tiny concrete statue, closely resembling input in vague outline. Paint colors also similar, but arranged such that Mini-173 appears to be wearing makeup. Object is also, inexplicably, wearing glow-sticks and a tall striped top hat.
Note: Accidentally blinked. Mini-173 tried to strangle my penis.

 Object Class: Fucking Keter, Jesus Christ 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5972-J is to be kept in Containment Locker 5972-J. Access to this locker is to be barred to all male personnel, even if they're drunk and their buddies bet them they couldn't get in. 
 Description: SCP-5972-J is a standard vacuum cleaner produced by The Kirby Company. SCP-5972-J appears to be a sentient predator. Males viewing SCP-5972-J will feel a sudden compulsion to stick their genitalia into the vacuum tube. SCP-5972-J will then activate at maximum power and… yeah… fuck… 
 SCP-5972-J has a secondary memetic effect. Males reading about its effects will feel extremely uncomfortable. This is followed by a contraction of the thigh muscles until the legs fully cover the genitalia, and a series of sharp inhalations.

 Foreword: Testing of the secondary effects of SCP-5972-J 
 <Begin Log> 
 Dr. Valen: I'm going to tell you what this thing does, and we're just going to gauge your reaction, alright? 
 D-5748: Alright. 
 Dr. Valen: So it's this vacuum cleaner, right? And when you see it, you want to put your dick in it. 
 D-5748: That's fucked up, man. 
 Dr. Valen: I know, crazy shit. Anyways, you put your dick in it, and it turns on. 
 D-5748: (Turning visibly white, legs turning inwards) Oh shit… 
 Dr. Valen: And then it just sucks your dick right off. 
 D-5748: (Nose flared in disgust. Leans back and snaps fingers) Whoa shit! 
 Dr. Valen: It sucks up the nuts too. 
 D-5748: (Winces and covers his eyes) Oh god, man. What the fuck?! 
 Dr. Valen: It's fucked up man. Like, seriously. Shit. 
 D-5748: I've seen a lot of crazy shit here, but man, fuck this. 
 Dr. Valen: I need to go out for some air. Want a drink? 
 D-5748: I need a fucking 6-pack.

SCP-6000-Jay,"""The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald""","""The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald - PlaguePJP & Limeyy 
 ▸ More by this Author ◂ 
 F.A.Q. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 1 
 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 
 ""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" 
 He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. 
 And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament""—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men. 
 My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. 
 I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ""Why—ye-es"" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two. 
 The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove. 
 It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. 
 ""How do you get to West Egg village?"" he asked helplessly. 
 I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood. 
 And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. 
 There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ""Yale News""—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the ""well-rounded man."" This isn't just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all. 
 It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. 
 I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's mansion. Or rather, as I didn't know Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month. 
 Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago. 
 Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that. 
 Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it—I had no sight into Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game. 
 And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch. 
 He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body. 
 His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. 
 ""Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,"" he seemed to say, ""just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are."" We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. 
 We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. 
 ""I've got a nice place here,"" he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. 
 Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore. 
 ""It belonged to Demaine the oil man."" He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. ""We'll go inside."" 
 We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. 
 The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. 
 The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in. 
 The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. 
 ""I'm p-paralyzed with happiness."" 
 She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.) 
 At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. 
 I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ""Listen,"" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. 
 I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me. 
 ""Do they miss me?"" she cried ecstatically. 
 ""The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the North Shore."" 
 ""How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!"" Then she added irrelevantly, ""You ought to see the baby."" 
 ""I'd like to."" 
 ""She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?"" 
 ""Never."" 
 ""Well, you ought to see her. She's—"" 
 Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder. 
 ""What you doing, Nick?"" 
 ""I'm a bond man."" 
 ""Who with?"" 
 I told him. 
 ""Never heard of them,"" he remarked decisively. 
 This annoyed me. 
 ""You will,"" I answered shortly. ""You will if you stay in the East."" 
 ""Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,"" he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. ""I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else."" 
 At this point Miss Baker said ""Absolutely!"" with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room. 
 ""I'm stiff,"" she complained, ""I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember."" 
 ""Don't look at me,"" Daisy retorted. ""I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon."" 
 ""No, thanks,"" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, ""I'm absolutely in training."" 
 Her host looked at her incredulously. 
 ""You are!"" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. ""How you ever get anything done is beyond me."" 
 I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she ""got done."" I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before. 
 ""You live in West Egg,"" she remarked contemptuously. ""I know somebody there."" 
 ""I don't know a single—"" 
 ""You must know SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby."" 
 ""SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby?"" demanded Daisy. ""What SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby?"" 
 Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square. 
 Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. 
 ""Why candles?"" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. ""In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year."" She looked at us all radiantly. ""Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it."" 
 ""We ought to plan something,"" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. 
 ""All right,"" said Daisy. ""What'll we plan?"" She turned to me helplessly. ""What do people plan?"" 
 Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger. 
 ""Look!"" she complained. ""I hurt it."" 
 We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue. 
 ""You did it, Tom,"" she said accusingly. ""I know you didn't mean to but you did do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of a—"" 
 ""I hate that word hulking,"" objected Tom crossly, ""even in kidding."" 
 ""Hulking,"" insisted Daisy. 
 Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here—and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. 
 ""You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,"" I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. ""Can't you talk about crops or something?"" 
 I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way. 
 ""Civilization's going to pieces,"" broke out Tom violently. ""I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?"" 
 ""Why, no,"" I answered, rather surprised by his tone. 
 ""Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved."" 
 ""Tom's getting very profound,"" said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. ""He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—"" 
 ""Well, these books are all scientific,"" insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. ""This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things."" 
 ""We've got to beat them down,"" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun. 
 ""You ought to live in California—"" began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. 
 ""This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and—"" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again. ""—and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art and all that. Do you see?"" 
 There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me. 
 ""I'll tell you a family secret,"" she whispered enthusiastically. ""It's about the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?"" 
 ""That's why I came over tonight."" 
 ""Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose—"" 
 ""Things went from bad to worse,"" suggested Miss Baker. 
 ""Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position."" 
 For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. 
 The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. 
 ""I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he?"" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation. ""An absolute rose?"" 
 This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house. 
 Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said ""Sh!"" in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether. 
 ""This Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—"" I said. 
 ""Don't talk. I want to hear what happens."" 
 ""Is something happening?"" I inquired innocently. 
 ""You mean to say you don't know?"" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. ""I thought everybody knew."" 
 ""I don't."" 
 ""Why—"" she said hesitantly, ""Tom's got some woman in New York."" 
 ""Got some woman?"" I repeated blankly. 
 Miss Baker nodded. 
 ""She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't you think?"" 
 Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table. 
 ""It couldn't be helped!"" cried Daisy with tense gayety. 
 She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: ""I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away—"" her voice sang ""—It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?"" 
 ""Very romantic,"" he said, and then miserably to me: ""If it's light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables."" 
 The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. 
 The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee. 
 Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. 
 ""We don't know each other very well, Nick,"" she said suddenly. ""Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding."" 
 ""I wasn't back from the war."" 
 ""That's true."" She hesitated. ""Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything."" 
 Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. 
 ""I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything."" 
 ""Oh, yes."" She looked at me absently. ""Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?"" 
 ""Very much."" 
 ""It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" 
 ""You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,"" she went on in a convinced way. ""Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything."" Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. ""Sophisticated—God, I'm sophisticated!"" 
 The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged. 
 Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the ""Saturday Evening Post""—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. 
 When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. 
 ""To be continued,"" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, ""in our very next issue."" 
 Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up. 
 ""Ten o'clock,"" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. ""Time for this good girl to go to bed."" 
 ""Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow,"" explained Daisy, ""over at Westchester."" 
 ""Oh,—you're Jordan Baker."" 
 I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago. 
 ""Good night,"" she said softly. ""Wake me at eight, won't you."" 
 ""If you'll get up."" 
 ""I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon."" 
 ""Of course you will,"" confirmed Daisy. ""In fact I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of—oh—fling you together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—"" 
 ""Good night,"" called Miss Baker from the stairs. ""I haven't heard a word."" 
 ""She's a nice girl,"" said Tom after a moment. ""They oughtn't to let her run around the country this way."" 
 ""Who oughtn't to?"" inquired Daisy coldly. 
 ""Her family."" 
 ""Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her."" 
 Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence. 
 ""Is she from New York?"" I asked quickly. 
 ""From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—"" 
 ""Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?"" demanded Tom suddenly. 
 ""Did I?"" She looked at me. ""I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—"" 
 ""Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,"" he advised me. 
 I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called ""Wait! 
 ""I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West."" 
 ""That's right,"" corroborated Tom kindly. ""We heard that you were engaged."" 
 ""It's libel. I'm too poor."" 
 ""But we heard it,"" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. ""We heard it from three people so it must be true."" 
 Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage. 
 Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he ""had some woman in New York"" was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart. 
 Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens. 
 I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 2 
 About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight. 
 But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground. 
 The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress. 
 The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car. 
 ""We're getting off!"" he insisted. ""I want you to meet my girl."" 
 I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do. 
 I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold—and I followed Tom inside. 
 The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes. 
 ""Hello, Wilson, old man,"" said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. ""How's business?"" 
 ""I can't complain,"" answered Wilson unconvincingly. ""When are you going to sell me that car?"" 
 ""Next week; I've got my man working on it now."" 
 ""Works pretty slow, don't he?"" 
 ""No, he doesn't,"" said Tom coldly. ""And if you feel that way about it, maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all."" 
 ""I don't mean that,"" explained Wilson quickly. ""I just meant—"" 
 His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice: 
 ""Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down."" 
 ""Oh, sure,"" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom. 
 ""I want to see you,"" said Tom intently. ""Get on the next train."" 
 ""All right."" 
 ""I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level."" 
 She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door. 
 We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track. 
 ""Terrible place, isn't it,"" said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg. 
 ""Awful."" 
 ""It does her good to get away."" 
 ""Doesn't her husband object?"" 
 ""Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb he doesn't know he's alive."" 
 So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train. 
 She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of ""Town Tattle"" and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass. 
 ""I want to get one of those dogs,"" she said earnestly. ""I want to get one for the apartment. They're nice to have—a dog."" 
 We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed. 
 ""What kind are they?"" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the taxi-window. 
 ""All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?"" 
 ""I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that kind?"" 
 The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck. 
 ""That's no police dog,"" said Tom. 
 ""No, it's not exactly a police dog,"" said the man with disappointment in his voice. ""It's more of an airedale."" He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. ""Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog that'll never bother you with catching cold."" 
 ""I think it's cute,"" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. ""How much is it?"" 
 ""That dog?"" He looked at it admiringly. ""That dog will cost you ten dollars."" 
 The airedale—undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture. 
 ""Is it a boy or a girl?"" she asked delicately. 
 ""That dog? That dog's a boy."" 
 ""It's a bitch,"" said Tom decisively. ""Here's your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it."" 
 We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner. 
 ""Hold on,"" I said, ""I have to leave you here."" 
 ""No, you don't,"" interposed Tom quickly. ""Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't come up to the apartment. Won't you, Myrtle?"" 
 ""Come on,"" she urged. ""I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know."" 
 ""Well, I'd like to, but—"" 
 We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in. 
 ""I'm going to have the McKees come up,"" she announced as we rose in the elevator. ""And of course I got to call up my sister, too."" 
 The apartment was on the top floor—a small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of ""Town Tattle"" lay on the table together with a copy of ""Simon Called Peter"" and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door. 
 I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of ""Simon Called Peter""—either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it didn't make any sense to me. 
 Just as Tom and Myrtle—after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names—reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. 
 The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel. 
 Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the ""artistic game"" and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married. 
 Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air. 
 ""My dear,"" she told her sister in a high mincing shout, ""most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out."" 
 ""What was the name of the woman?"" asked Mrs. McKee. 
 ""Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own homes."" 
 ""I like your dress,"" remarked Mrs. McKee, ""I think it's adorable."" 
 Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain. 
 ""It's just a crazy old thing,"" she said. ""I just slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look like."" 
 ""But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,"" pursued Mrs. McKee. ""If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it."" 
 We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face. 
 ""I should change the light,"" he said after a moment. ""I'd like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the back hair."" 
 ""I wouldn't think of changing the light,"" cried Mrs. McKee. ""I think it's—"" 
 Her husband said ""Sh! "" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet. 
 ""You McKees have something to drink,"" he said. ""Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep."" 
 ""I told that boy about the ice."" Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. ""These people! You have to keep after them all the time."" 
 She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there. 
 ""I've done some nice things out on Long Island,"" asserted Mr. McKee. 
 Tom looked at him blankly. 
 ""Two of them we have framed downstairs."" 
 ""Two what?"" demanded Tom. 
 ""Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point—the Gulls,' and the other I call 'Montauk Point—the Sea.' "" 
 The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. 
 ""Do you live down on Long Island, too?"" she inquired. 
 ""I live at West Egg."" 
 ""Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's. Do you know him?"" 
 ""I live next door to him."" 
 ""Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's where all his money comes from."" 
 ""Really?"" 
 She nodded. 
 ""I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me."" 
 This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine: 
 ""Chester, I think you could do something with her,"" she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to Tom. 
 ""I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start."" 
 ""Ask Myrtle,"" said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. ""She'll give you a letter of introduction, won't you, Myrtle?"" 
 ""Do what?"" she asked, startled. 
 ""You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him."" His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented. "" 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like that."" 
 Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: ""Neither of them can stand the person they're married to."" 
 ""Can't they?"" 
 ""Can't stand them."" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. ""What I say is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get a divorce and get married to each other right away."" 
 ""Doesn't she like Wilson either?"" 
 The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene. 
 ""You see?"" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. ""It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and they don't believe in divorce."" 
 Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie. 
 ""When they do get married,"" continued Catherine, ""they're going west to live for a while until it blows over."" 
 ""It'd be more discreet to go to Europe."" 
 ""Oh, do you like Europe?"" she exclaimed surprisingly. ""I just got back from Monte Carlo."" 
 ""Really."" 
 ""Just last year. I went over there with another girl."" 
 ""Stay long?"" 
 ""No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!"" 
 The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room. 
 ""I almost made a mistake, too,"" she declared vigorously. ""I almost married a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below you!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure."" 
 ""Yes, but listen,"" said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, ""at least you didn't marry him."" 
 ""I know I didn't."" 
 ""Well, I married him,"" said Myrtle, ambiguously. ""And that's the difference between your case and mine."" 
 ""Why did you, Myrtle?"" demanded Catherine. ""Nobody forced you to."" 
 Myrtle considered. 
 ""I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,"" she said finally. ""I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick my shoe."" 
 ""You were crazy about him for a while,"" said Catherine. 
 ""Crazy about him!"" cried Myrtle incredulously. ""Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there."" 
 She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past. 
 ""The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out. She looked around to see who was listening: "" 'Oh, is that your suit?' I said. 'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon."" 
 ""She really ought to get away from him,"" resumed Catherine to me. ""They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had."" 
 The bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who ""felt just as good on nothing at all."" Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life. 
 Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom. 
 ""It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm—and so I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live forever, you can't live forever.' "" 
 She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter. 
 ""My dear,"" she cried, ""I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm through with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to make a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't forget all the things I got to do."" 
 It was nine o'clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon. 
 The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name. 
 ""Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!"" shouted Mrs. Wilson. ""I'll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai—"" 
 Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand. 
 Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of ""Town Tattle"" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier I followed. 
 ""Come to lunch some day,"" he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator. 
 ""Where?"" 
 ""Anywhere."" 
 ""Keep your hands off the lever,"" snapped the elevator boy. 
 ""I beg your pardon,"" said Mr. McKee with dignity, ""I didn't know I was touching it."" 
 ""All right,"" I agreed, ""I'll be glad to."" 
 … I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands. 
 ""Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook'n Bridge … ."" 
 Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning ""Tribune"" and waiting for the four o'clock train. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 3 
 There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before. 
 Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb. 
 At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another. 
 By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names. 
 The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath—already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light. 
 Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the ""Follies."" The party has begun. 
 I believe that on the first night I went to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission. 
 I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer—the honor would be entirely SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's, it said, if I would attend his ""little party"" that night. He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand. 
 Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key. 
 As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone. 
 I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden. 
 Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by. 
 ""Hello!"" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden. 
 ""I thought you might be here,"" she responded absently as I came up. ""I remembered you lived next door to—"" 
 She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps. 
 ""Hello!"" they cried together. ""Sorry you didn't win."" 
 That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before. 
 ""You don't know who we are,"" said one of the girls in yellow, ""but we met you here about a month ago."" 
 ""You've dyed your hair since then,"" remarked Jordan, and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's basket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble. 
 ""Do you come to these parties often?"" inquired Jordan of the girl beside her. 
 ""The last one was the one I met you at,"" answered the girl, in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion: ""Wasn't it for you, Lucille?"" 
 It was for Lucille, too. 
 ""I like to come,"" Lucille said. ""I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's with a new evening gown in it."" 
 ""Did you keep it?"" asked Jordan. 
 ""Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars."" 
 ""There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,"" said the other girl eagerly. ""He doesn't want any trouble with anybody."" 
 ""Who doesn't?"" I inquired. 
 ""SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. Somebody told me—"" 
 The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially. 
 ""Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once."" 
 A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly. 
 ""I don't think it's so much that,"" argued Lucille skeptically; ""it's more that he was a German spy during the war."" 
 One of the men nodded in confirmation. 
 ""I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,"" he assured us positively. 
 ""Oh, no,"" said the first girl, ""it couldn't be that, because he was in the American army during the war."" As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. ""You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man."" 
 She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world. 
 The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety. 
 ""Let's get out,"" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. ""This is much too polite for me."" 
 We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host—I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way. 
 The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby was not there. She couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas. 
 A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. 
 ""What do you think?"" he demanded impetuously. 
 ""About what?"" 
 He waved his hand toward the book-shelves. 
 ""About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They're real."" 
 ""The books?"" 
 He nodded. 
 ""Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you."" 
 Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ""Stoddard Lectures."" 
 ""See!"" he cried triumphantly. ""It's a bona fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too—didn't cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?"" 
 He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse. 
 ""Who brought you?"" he demanded. ""Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought."" 
 Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering. 
 ""I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,"" he continued. ""Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library."" 
 ""Has it?"" 
 ""A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're—"" 
 ""You told us."" 
 We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors. 
 There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ""stunts"" all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage ""twins""—who turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn. 
 I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound. 
 At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. 
 ""Your face is familiar,"" he said, politely. ""Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?"" 
 ""Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion."" 
 ""I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before."" 
 We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning. 
 ""Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound."" 
 ""What time?"" 
 ""Any time that suits you best."" 
 It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled. 
 ""Having a gay time now?"" she inquired. 
 ""Much better."" I turned again to my new acquaintance. ""This is an unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there—"" I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, ""and this man SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation."" 
 For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand. 
 ""I'm SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby,"" he said suddenly. 
 ""What!"" I exclaimed. ""Oh, I beg your pardon."" 
 ""I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host."" 
 He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care. 
 Almost at the moment when Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. 
 ""If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,"" he urged me. ""Excuse me. I will rejoin you later."" 
 When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. 
 ""Who is he?"" I demanded. ""Do you know?"" 
 ""He's just a man named SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby."" 
 ""Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?"" 
 ""Now you're started on the subject,"" she answered with a wan smile. ""Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford man."" 
 A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away. 
 ""However, I don't believe it."" 
 ""Why not?"" 
 ""I don't know,"" she insisted, ""I just don't think he went there."" 
 Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's ""I think he killed a man,"" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn't—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn't—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound. 
 ""Anyhow he gives large parties,"" said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ""And I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."" 
 There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden. 
 ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he cried. ""At the request of Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation."" He smiled with jovial condescension and added ""Some sensation!"" whereupon everybody laughed. 
 ""The piece is known,"" he concluded lustily, ""as 'Vladimir Tostoff's Jazz History of the World.' "" 
 The nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the ""Jazz History of the World"" was over girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and no French bob touched SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's head for one link. 
 ""I beg your pardon."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us. 
 ""Miss Baker?"" he inquired. ""I beg your pardon but Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby would like to speak to you alone."" 
 ""With me?"" she exclaimed in surprise. 
 ""Yes, madame."" 
 She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings. 
 I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside. 
 The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep. 
 ""She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,"" explained a girl at my elbow. 
 I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed ""You promised!"" into his ear. 
 The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices. 
 ""Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home."" 
 ""Never heard anything so selfish in my life."" 
 ""We're always the first ones to leave."" 
 ""So are we."" 
 ""Well, we're almost the last tonight,"" said one of the men sheepishly. ""The orchestra left half an hour ago."" 
 In spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night. 
 As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye. 
 Jordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands. 
 ""I've just heard the most amazing thing,"" she whispered. ""How long were we in there?"" 
 ""Why,—about an hour."" 
 ""It was—simply amazing,"" she repeated abstractedly. ""But I swore I wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you."" She yawned gracefully in my face. ""Please come and see me… . Phone book… . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard… . My aunt… ."" She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door. 
 Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden. 
 ""Don't mention it,"" he enjoined me eagerly. ""Don't give it another thought, old sport."" The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. ""And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."" 
 Then the butler, behind his shoulder: 
 ""Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir."" 
 ""All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there… . good night."" 
 ""Good night."" 
 ""Good night."" He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ""Good night, old sport… . Good night."" 
 But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene. 
 A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way. 
 ""See!"" he explained. ""It went in the ditch."" 
 The fact was infinitely astonishing to him—and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man—it was the late patron of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's library. 
 ""How'd it happen?"" 
 He shrugged his shoulders. 
 ""I know nothing whatever about mechanics,"" he said decisively. 
 ""But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?"" 
 ""Don't ask me,"" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. ""I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that's all I know."" 
 ""Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night."" 
 ""But I wasn't even trying,"" he explained indignantly, ""I wasn't even trying."" 
 An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. 
 ""Do you want to commit suicide?"" 
 ""You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!"" 
 ""You don't understand,"" explained the criminal. ""I wasn't driving. There's another man in the car."" 
 The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ""Ah-h-h!"" as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe. 
 Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster. 
 ""Wha's matter?"" he inquired calmly. ""Did we run outa gas?"" 
 ""Look!"" 
 Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky. 
 ""It came off,"" some one explained. 
 He nodded. 
 ""At first I din' notice we'd stopped."" 
 A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice: 
 ""Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?"" 
 At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond. 
 ""Back out,"" he suggested after a moment. ""Put her in reverse."" 
 ""But the wheel's off!"" 
 He hesitated. 
 ""No harm in trying,"" he said. 
 The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell. 
 Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs. 
 Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away. 
 I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station. 
 I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life. 
 Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well. 
 For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don't in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind. 
 Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body. 
 It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man's coat. 
 ""You're a rotten driver,"" I protested. ""Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn't to drive at all."" 
 ""I am careful."" 
 ""No, you're not."" 
 ""Well, other people are,"" she said lightly. 
 ""What's that got to do with it?"" 
 ""They'll keep out of my way,"" she insisted. ""It takes two to make an accident."" 
 ""Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself."" 
 ""I hope I never will,"" she answered. ""I hate careless people. That's why I like you."" 
 Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing them: ""Love, Nick,"" and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free. 
 Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 4 
 On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore the world and its mistress returned to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn. 
 ""He's a bootlegger,"" said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. ""One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass."" 
 Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds and headed ""This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922."" But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him. 
 From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all. 
 Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Beluga's girls. 
 From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (""Rot-Gut"") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day. 
 A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as ""the boarder""—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square. 
 Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be. 
 In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten. 
 All these people came to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house in the summer. 
 At nine o'clock, one morning late in July SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach. 
 ""Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I thought we'd ride up together."" 
 He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand. 
 He saw me looking with admiration at his car. 
 ""It's pretty, isn't it, old sport."" He jumped off to give me a better view. ""Haven't you ever seen it before?"" 
 I'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town. 
 I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door. 
 And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg village before SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit. 
 ""Look here, old sport,"" he broke out surprisingly. ""What's your opinion of me, anyhow?"" 
 A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves. 
 ""Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life,"" he interrupted. ""I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear."" 
 So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls. 
 ""I'll tell you God's truth."" His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. ""I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition."" 
 He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase ""educated at Oxford,"" or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't something a little sinister about him after all. 
 ""What part of the middle-west?"" I inquired casually. 
 ""San Francisco."" 
 ""I see."" 
 ""My family all died and I came into a good deal of money."" 
 His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise. 
 ""After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago."" 
 With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned ""character"" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne. 
 ""Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!"" 
 Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines. 
 He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm. 
 ""That's the one from Montenegro."" 
 To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. 
 Orderi di Danilo, ran the circular legend, Montenegro, Nicolas Rex. 
 ""Turn it."" 
 Major SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, I read, For Valour Extraordinary. 
 ""Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."" 
 It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand. 
 Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart. 
 ""I'm going to make a big request of you today,"" he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, ""so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me."" He hesitated. ""You'll hear about it this afternoon."" 
 ""At lunch?"" 
 ""No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker to tea."" 
 ""Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?"" 
 ""No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter."" 
 I hadn't the faintest idea what ""this matter"" was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn. 
 He wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by. 
 With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar ""jug—jug—spat!"" of a motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside. 
 ""All right, old sport,"" called SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes. 
 ""Right you are,"" agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. ""Know you next time, Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. Excuse me!"" 
 ""What was that?"" I inquired. ""The picture of Oxford?"" 
 ""I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year."" 
 Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. 
 A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry. 
 ""Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge,"" I thought; ""anything at all… ."" 
 Even SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. 
 Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man. 
 ""Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem."" 
 A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness. 
 ""—so I took one look at him—"" said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, ""—and what do you think I did?"" 
 ""What?"" I inquired politely. 
 But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby with his expressive nose. 
 ""I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh, don't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and there."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction. 
 ""Highballs?"" asked the head waiter. 
 ""This is a nice restaurant here,"" said Mr. Wolfshiem looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. ""But I like across the street better!"" 
 ""Yes, highballs,"" agreed SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: ""It's too hot over there."" 
 ""Hot and small—yes,"" said Mr. Wolfshiem, ""but full of memories."" 
 ""What place is that?"" I asked. 
 ""The old Metropole. 
 ""The old Metropole,"" brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. ""Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair. 
 "" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you, so help me, move outside this room.' 
 ""It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight."" 
 ""Did he go?"" I asked innocently. 
 ""Sure he went,""—Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me indignantly—""He turned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away my coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away."" 
 ""Four of them were electrocuted,"" I said, remembering. 
 ""Five with Becker."" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. ""I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion."" 
 The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby answered for me: 
 ""Oh, no,"" he exclaimed, ""this isn't the man!"" 
 ""No?"" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed. 
 ""This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other time."" 
 ""I beg your pardon,"" said Mr. Wolfshiem, ""I had a wrong man."" 
 A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table. 
 ""Look here, old sport,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, leaning toward me, ""I'm afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car."" 
 There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it. 
 ""I don't like mysteries,"" I answered. ""And I don't understand why you won't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?"" 
 ""Oh, it's nothing underhand,"" he assured me. ""Miss Baker's a great sportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right."" 
 Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table. 
 ""He has to telephone,"" said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. ""Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman."" 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""He's an Oggsford man."" 
 ""Oh!"" 
 ""He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?"" 
 ""I've heard of it."" 
 ""It's one of the most famous colleges in the world."" 
 ""Have you known SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby for a long time?"" I inquired. 
 ""Several years,"" he answered in a gratified way. ""I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.' "" He paused. ""I see you're looking at my cuff buttons."" 
 I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory. 
 ""Finest specimens of human molars,"" he informed me. 
 ""Well!"" I inspected them. ""That's a very interesting idea."" 
 ""Yeah."" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. ""Yeah, SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife."" 
 When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet. 
 ""I have enjoyed my lunch,"" he said, ""and I'm going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome."" 
 ""Don't hurry, Meyer,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction. 
 ""You're very polite but I belong to another generation,"" he announced solemnly. ""You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—"" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand—""As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself on you any longer."" 
 As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him. 
 ""He becomes very sentimental sometimes,"" explained SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""This is one of his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway."" 
 ""Who is he anyhow—an actor?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""A dentist?"" 
 ""Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's a gambler."" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: ""He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919."" 
 ""Fixed the World's Series?"" I repeated. 
 The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe. 
 ""How did he happen to do that?"" I asked after a minute. 
 ""He just saw the opportunity."" 
 ""Why isn't he in jail?"" 
 ""They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man."" 
 I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room. 
 ""Come along with me for a minute,"" I said. ""I've got to say hello to someone."" 
 When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction. 
 ""Where've you been?"" he demanded eagerly. ""Daisy's furious because you haven't called up."" 
 ""This is Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan."" 
 They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's face. 
 ""How've you been, anyhow?"" demanded Tom of me. ""How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?"" 
 ""I've been having lunch with Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby."" 
 I turned toward Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, but he was no longer there. 
 One October day in nineteen-seventeen—(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)—I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut in a disapproving way. 
 The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, ""anyways, for an hour!"" 
 When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until I was five feet away. 
 ""Hello Jordan,"" she called unexpectedly. ""Please come here."" 
 I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the same man. 
 That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't get into the army at all. 
 By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
 I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other. 
 "" 'Gratulate me,"" she muttered. ""Never had a drink before but oh, how I do enjoy it."" 
 ""What's the matter, Daisy?"" 
 I was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before. 
 ""Here, dearis."" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. ""Take 'em downstairs and give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her mine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'."" 
 She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow. 
 But she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months' trip to the South Seas. 
 I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute she'd look around uneasily and say ""Where's Tom gone?"" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel. 
 The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there's something in that voice of hers… . 
 Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said ""What SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby?"" and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby with the officer in her white car. 
 When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight: 
 I'm the Sheik of Araby,
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep,
Into your tent I'll creep— 
 ""It was a strange coincidence,"" I said. 
 ""But it wasn't a coincidence at all."" 
 ""Why not?"" 
 ""SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay."" 
 Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor. 
 ""He wants to know—"" continued Jordan ""—if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over."" 
 The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could ""come over"" some afternoon to a stranger's garden. 
 ""Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?"" 
 ""He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see he's a regular tough underneath it all."" 
 Something worried me. 
 ""Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?"" 
 ""He wants her to see his house,"" she explained. ""And your house is right next door."" 
 ""Oh!"" 
 ""I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,"" went on Jordan, ""but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he'd go mad: 
 "" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to see her right next door.' 
 ""When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name."" 
 It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: ""There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."" 
 ""And Daisy ought to have something in her life,"" murmured Jordan to me. 
 ""Does she want to see SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby?"" 
 ""She's not to know about it. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're just supposed to invite her to tea."" 
 We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 5 
 When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it was SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar. 
 At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into ""hide-and-go-seek"" or ""sardines-in-the-box"" with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn. 
 ""Your place looks like the world's fair,"" I said. 
 ""Does it?"" He turned his eyes toward it absently. ""I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car."" 
 ""It's too late."" 
 ""Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer."" 
 ""I've got to go to bed."" 
 ""All right."" 
 He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness. 
 ""I talked with Miss Baker,"" I said after a moment. ""I'm going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea."" 
 ""Oh, that's all right,"" he said carelessly. ""I don't want to put you to any trouble."" 
 ""What day would suit you?"" 
 ""What day would suit you?"" he corrected me quickly. ""I don't want to put you to any trouble, you see."" 
 ""How about the day after tomorrow?"" He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: 
 ""I want to get the grass cut,"" he said. 
 We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass. 
 ""There's another little thing,"" he said uncertainly, and hesitated. 
 ""Would you rather put it off for a few days?"" I asked. 
 ""Oh, it isn't about that. At least—"" He fumbled with a series of beginnings. ""Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don't make much money, do you?"" 
 ""Not very much."" 
 This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently. 
 ""I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I thought that if you don't make very much—You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport?"" 
 ""Trying to."" 
 ""Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing."" 
 I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there. 
 ""I've got my hands full,"" I said. ""I'm much obliged but I couldn't take on any more work."" 
 ""You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfshiem."" Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the ""gonnegtion"" mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home. 
 The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he ""glanced into rooms"" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea. 
 ""Don't bring Tom,"" I warned her. 
 ""What?"" 
 ""Don't bring Tom."" 
 ""Who is 'Tom'?"" she asked innocently. 
 The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers. 
 The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived from SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes. 
 ""Is everything all right?"" he asked immediately. 
 ""The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean."" 
 ""What grass?"" he inquired blankly. ""Oh, the grass in the yard."" He looked out the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe he saw a thing. 
 ""Looks very good,"" he remarked vaguely. ""One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?"" 
 I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. 
 ""Will they do?"" I asked. 
 ""Of course, of course! They're fine!"" and he added hollowly, ""…old sport."" 
 The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay's ""Economics,"" starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home. 
 ""Why's that?"" 
 ""Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!"" He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. ""I can't wait all day."" 
 ""Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four."" 
 He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard. 
 Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile. 
 ""Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?"" 
 The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car. 
 ""Are you in love with me,"" she said low in my ear. ""Or why did I have to come alone?"" 
 ""That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour."" 
 ""Come back in an hour, Ferdie."" Then in a grave murmur, ""His name is Ferdie."" 
 ""Does the gasoline affect his nose?"" 
 ""I don't think so,"" she said innocently. ""Why?"" 
 We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted. 
 ""Well, that's funny!"" I exclaimed. 
 ""What's funny?"" 
 She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes. 
 With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain. 
 For half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's voice on a clear artificial note. 
 ""I certainly am awfully glad to see you again."" 
 A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair. 
 ""We've met before,"" muttered SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand. 
 ""I'm sorry about the clock,"" he said. 
 My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head. 
 ""It's an old clock,"" I told them idiotically. 
 I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor. 
 ""We haven't met for many years,"" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. 
 ""Five years next November."" 
 The automatic quality of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. 
 Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet. 
 ""Where are you going?"" demanded SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby in immediate alarm. 
 ""I'll be back."" 
 ""I've got to speak to you about something before you go."" 
 He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: ""Oh, God!"" in a miserable way. 
 ""What's the matter?"" 
 ""This is a terrible mistake,"" he said, shaking his head from side to side, ""a terrible, terrible mistake."" 
 ""You're just embarrassed, that's all,"" and luckily I added: ""Daisy's embarrassed too."" 
 ""She's embarrassed?"" he repeated incredulously. 
 ""Just as much as you are."" 
 ""Don't talk so loud."" 
 ""You're acting like a little boy,"" I broke out impatiently. ""Not only that but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone."" 
 He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room. 
 I walked out the back way—just as SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the ""period"" craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay five years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry. 
 After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile rounded SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner—I felt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too. 
 I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove—but I don't believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room. 
 ""Oh, hello, old sport,"" he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands. 
 ""It's stopped raining."" 
 ""Has it?"" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. ""What do you think of that? It's stopped raining."" 
 ""I'm glad, SCP-6000-Jay."" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy. 
 ""I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,"" he said, ""I'd like to show her around."" 
 ""You're sure you want me to come?"" 
 ""Absolutely, old sport."" 
 Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. 
 ""My house looks well, doesn't it?"" he demanded. ""See how the whole front of it catches the light."" 
 I agreed that it was splendid. 
 ""Yes."" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. ""It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it."" 
 ""I thought you inherited your money."" 
 ""I did, old sport,"" he said automatically, ""but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war."" 
 I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered ""That's my affair,"" before he realized that it wasn't the appropriate reply. 
 ""Oh, I've been in several things,"" he corrected himself. ""I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either one now."" He looked at me with more attention. ""Do you mean you've been thinking over what I proposed the other night?"" 
 Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight. 
 ""That huge place there?"" she cried pointing. 
 ""Do you like it?"" 
 ""I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone."" 
 ""I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people."" 
 Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees. 
 And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby closed the door of ""the Merton College Library"" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter. 
 We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the ""boarder."" I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. 
 He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs. 
 His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. 
 ""It's the funniest thing, old sport,"" he said hilariously. ""I can't—when I try to—"" 
 He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock. 
 Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. 
 ""I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall."" 
 He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily. 
 ""They're such beautiful shirts,"" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. ""It makes me sad because I've never seen such—such beautiful shirts before."" 
 After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers—but outside SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound. 
 ""If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock."" 
 Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. 
 I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. 
 ""Who's this?"" 
 ""That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport."" 
 The name sounded faintly familiar. 
 ""He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago."" 
 There was a small picture of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen. 
 ""I adore it!"" exclaimed Daisy. ""The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht."" 
 ""Look at this,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby quickly. ""Here's a lot of clippings—about you."" 
 They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby took up the receiver. 
 ""Yes… . Well, I can't talk now… . I can't talk now, old sport… . I said a small town… . He must know what a small town is… . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town… ."" 
 He rang off. 
 ""Come here quick!"" cried Daisy at the window. 
 The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. 
 ""Look at that,"" she whispered, and then after a moment: ""I'd like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around."" 
 I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone. 
 ""I know what we'll do,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, ""we'll have Klipspringer play the piano."" 
 He went out of the room calling ""Ewing!"" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a ""sport shirt"" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue. 
 ""Did we interrupt your exercises?"" inquired Daisy politely. 
 ""I was asleep,"" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. ""That is, I'd been asleep. Then I got up… ."" 
 ""Klipspringer plays the piano,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, cutting him off. ""Don't you, Ewing, old sport?"" 
 ""I don't play well. I don't—I hardly play at all. I'm all out of prac—"" 
 ""We'll go downstairs,"" interrupted SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light. 
 In the music room SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall. 
 When Klipspringer had played ""The Love Nest"" he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby in the gloom. 
 ""I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all out of prac—"" 
 ""Don't talk so much, old sport,"" commanded SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""Play!"" 
 In the morning,
In the evening,
Ain't we got fun— 
 Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air. 
 One thing's sure and nothing's surer
The rich get richer and the poor get—children.
In the meantime,
In between time— 
 As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart. 
 As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song. 
 They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 6 
 About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say. 
 ""Anything to say about what?"" inquired SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby politely. 
 ""Why,—any statement to give out."" 
 It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out ""to see."" 
 It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the ""underground pipe-line to Canada"" attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't easy to say. 
 James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the Tuolomee and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour. 
 I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father's Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. 
 For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted. 
 But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing. 
 An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore. 
 Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay. 
 To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby left too. 
 He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died. 
 I remember the portrait of him up in SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard empty face—the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone. 
 And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man. 
 He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away. 
 It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened before. 
 They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously. 
 ""I'm delighted to see you,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby standing on his porch. ""I'm delighted that you dropped in."" 
 As though they cared! 
 ""Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar."" He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. ""I'll have something to drink for you in just a minute."" 
 He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… . I'm sorry— 
 ""Did you have a nice ride?"" 
 ""Very good roads around here."" 
 ""I suppose the automobiles—"" 
 ""Yeah."" 
 Moved by an irresistible impulse, SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. 
 ""I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan."" 
 ""Oh, yes,"" said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering. ""So we did. I remember very well."" 
 ""About two weeks ago."" 
 ""That's right. You were with Nick here."" 
 ""I know your wife,"" continued SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, almost aggressively. 
 ""That so?"" 
 Tom turned to me. 
 ""You live near here, Nick?"" 
 ""Next door."" 
 ""That so?"" 
 Mr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial. 
 ""We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby,"" she suggested. ""What do you say?"" 
 ""Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you."" 
 ""Be ver' nice,"" said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. ""Well—think ought to be starting home."" 
 ""Please don't hurry,"" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. ""Why don't you—why don't you stay for supper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York."" 
 ""You come to supper with me,"" said the lady enthusiastically. ""Both of you."" 
 This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet. 
 ""Come along,"" he said—but to her only. 
 ""I mean it,"" she insisted. ""I'd love to have you. Lots of room."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't. 
 ""I'm afraid I won't be able to,"" I said. 
 ""Well, you come,"" she urged, concentrating on SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear. 
 ""We won't be late if we start now,"" she insisted aloud. 
 ""I haven't got a horse,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""I used to ride in the army but I've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute."" 
 The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. 
 ""My God, I believe the man's coming,"" said Tom. ""Doesn't he know she doesn't want him?"" 
 ""She says she does want him."" 
 ""She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there."" He frowned. ""I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish."" 
 Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses. 
 ""Come on,"" said Mr. Sloane to Tom, ""we're late. We've got to go."" And then to me: ""Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?"" 
 Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door. 
 Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment. 
 They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat. 
 ""These things excite me so,"" she whispered. ""If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I'm giving out green—"" 
 ""Look around,"" suggested SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 ""I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous—"" 
 ""You must see the faces of many people you've heard about."" 
 Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd. 
 ""We don't go around very much,"" he said. ""In fact I was just thinking I don't know a soul here."" 
 ""Perhaps you know that lady."" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies. 
 ""She's lovely,"" said Daisy. 
 ""The man bending over her is her director."" 
 He took them ceremoniously from group to group: 
 ""Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—"" After an instant's hesitation he added: ""the polo player."" 
 ""Oh no,"" objected Tom quickly, ""Not me."" 
 But evidently the sound of it pleased SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby for Tom remained ""the polo player"" for the rest of the evening. 
 ""I've never met so many celebrities!"" Daisy exclaimed. ""I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer. 
 ""Well, I liked him anyhow."" 
 ""I'd a little rather not be the polo player,"" said Tom pleasantly, ""I'd rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion."" 
 Daisy and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden: ""In case there's a fire or a flood,"" she explained, ""or any act of God."" 
 Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. ""Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?"" he said. ""A fellow's getting off some funny stuff."" 
 ""Go ahead,"" answered Daisy genially, ""And if you want to take down any addresses here's my little gold pencil… ."" She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was ""common but pretty,"" and I knew that except for the half hour she'd been alone with SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby she wasn't having a good time. 
 We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby had been called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now. 
 ""How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?"" 
 The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes. 
 ""Wha?"" 
 A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence: 
 ""Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone."" 
 ""I do leave it alone,"" affirmed the accused hollowly. 
 ""We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody that needs your help, Doc.' "" 
 ""She's much obliged, I'm sure,"" said another friend, without gratitude. ""But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool."" 
 ""Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,"" mumbled Miss Baedeker. ""They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey."" 
 ""Then you ought to leave it alone,"" countered Doctor Civet. 
 ""Speak for yourself!"" cried Miss Baedeker violently. ""Your hand shakes. I wouldn't let you operate on me!"" 
 It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek. 
 ""I like her,"" said Daisy, ""I think she's lovely."" 
 But the rest offended her—and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented ""place"" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand. 
 I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass. 
 ""Who is this SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby anyhow?"" demanded Tom suddenly. ""Some big bootlegger?"" 
 ""Where'd you hear that?"" I inquired. 
 ""I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know."" 
 ""Not SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby,"" I said shortly. 
 He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet. 
 ""Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together."" 
 A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar. 
 ""At least they're more interesting than the people we know,"" she said with an effort. 
 ""You didn't look so interested."" 
 ""Well, I was."" 
 Tom laughed and turned to me. 
 ""Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?"" 
 Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air. 
 ""Lots of people come who haven't been invited,"" she said suddenly. ""That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's too polite to object."" 
 ""I'd like to know who he is and what he does,"" insisted Tom. ""And I think I'll make a point of finding out."" 
 ""I can tell you right now,"" she answered. ""He owned some drug stores, a lot of drug stores. He built them up himself."" 
 The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. 
 ""Good night, Nick,"" said Daisy. 
 Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where ""Three o'Clock in the Morning,"" a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion. 
 I stayed late that night. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired. 
 ""She didn't like it,"" he said immediately. 
 ""Of course she did."" 
 ""She didn't like it,"" he insisted. ""She didn't have a good time."" 
 He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression. 
 ""I feel far away from her,"" he said. ""It's hard to make her understand."" 
 ""You mean about the dance?"" 
 ""The dance?"" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. ""Old sport, the dance is unimportant."" 
 He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: ""I never loved you."" After she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago. 
 ""And she doesn't understand,"" he said. ""She used to be able to understand. We'd sit for hours—"" 
 He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers. 
 ""I wouldn't ask too much of her,"" I ventured. ""You can't repeat the past."" 
 ""Can't repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can!"" 
 He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. 
 ""I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,"" he said, nodding determinedly. ""She'll see."" 
 He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was… . 
 … One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. 
 His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. 
 Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever. 
 It was when curiosity about SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. 
 Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door. 
 ""Is Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby sick?"" 
 ""Nope."" After a pause he added ""sir"" in a dilatory, grudging way. 
 ""I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over."" 
 ""Who?"" he demanded rudely. 
 ""Carraway."" 
 ""Carraway. All right, I'll tell him."" Abruptly he slammed the door. 
 My Finn informed me that SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren't servants at all. 
 Next day SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby called me on the phone. 
 ""Going away?"" I inquired. 
 ""No, old sport."" 
 ""I hear you fired all your servants."" 
 ""I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons."" 
 So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes. 
 ""They're some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They're all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel."" 
 ""I see."" 
 He was calling up at Daisy's request—would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby had outlined in the garden. 
 The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor. 
 ""Oh, my!"" she gasped. 
 I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same. 
 ""Hot!"" said the conductor to familiar faces. ""Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?"" 
 My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart! 
 … Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and me as we waited at the door. 
 ""The master's body!"" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. ""I'm sorry, madame, but we can't furnish it—it's far too hot to touch this noon!"" 
 What he really said was: ""Yes … yes … I'll see."" 
 He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats. 
 ""Madame expects you in the salon!"" he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life. 
 The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans. 
 ""We can't move,"" they said together. 
 Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine. 
 ""And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?"" I inquired. 
 Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air. 
 ""The rumor is,"" whispered Jordan, ""that that's Tom's girl on the telephone."" 
 We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance. ""Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all… . I'm under no obligations to you at all… . And as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!"" 
 ""Holding down the receiver,"" said Daisy cynically. 
 ""No, he's not,"" I assured her. ""It's a bona fide deal. I happen to know about it."" 
 Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room. 
 ""Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby!"" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. ""I'm glad to see you, sir… . Nick… ."" 
 ""Make us a cold drink,"" cried Daisy. 
 As he left the room again she got up and went over to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth. 
 ""You know I love you,"" she murmured. 
 ""You forget there's a lady present,"" said Jordan. 
 Daisy looked around doubtfully. 
 ""You kiss Nick too."" 
 ""What a low, vulgar girl!"" 
 ""I don't care!"" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room. 
 ""Bles-sed pre-cious,"" she crooned, holding out her arms. ""Come to your own mother that loves you."" 
 The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother's dress. 
 ""The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had ever really believed in its existence before. 
 ""I got dressed before luncheon,"" said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy. 
 ""That's because your mother wanted to show you off."" Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. ""You dream, you. You absolute little dream."" 
 ""Yes,"" admitted the child calmly. ""Aunt Jordan's got on a white dress too."" 
 ""How do you like mother's friends?"" Daisy turned her around so that she faced SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""Do you think they're pretty?"" 
 ""Where's Daddy?"" 
 ""She doesn't look like her father,"" explained Daisy. ""She looks like me. She's got my hair and shape of the face."" 
 Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand. 
 ""Come, Pammy."" 
 ""Goodbye, sweetheart!"" 
 With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby took up his drink. 
 ""They certainly look cool,"" he said, with visible tension. 
 We drank in long greedy swallows. 
 ""I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year,"" said Tom genially. ""It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it's just the opposite—the sun's getting colder every year. 
 ""Come outside,"" he suggested to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, ""I'd like you to have a look at the place."" 
 I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay. 
 ""I'm right across from you."" 
 ""So you are."" 
 Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles. 
 ""There's sport for you,"" said Tom, nodding. ""I'd like to be out there with him for about an hour."" 
 We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale. 
 ""What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,"" cried Daisy, ""and the day after that, and the next thirty years?"" 
 ""Don't be morbid,"" Jordan said. ""Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall."" 
 ""But it's so hot,"" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, ""And everything's so confused. Let's all go to town!"" 
 Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms. 
 ""I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,"" Tom was saying to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, ""but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage."" 
 ""Who wants to go to town?"" demanded Daisy insistently. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's eyes floated toward her. ""Ah,"" she cried, ""you look so cool."" 
 Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. 
 ""You always look so cool,"" she repeated. 
 She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago. 
 ""You resemble the advertisement of the man,"" she went on innocently. ""You know the advertisement of the man—"" 
 ""All right,"" broke in Tom quickly, ""I'm perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we're all going to town."" 
 He got up, his eyes still flashing between SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and his wife. No one moved. 
 ""Come on!"" His temper cracked a little. ""What's the matter, anyhow? If we're going to town let's start."" 
 His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive. 
 ""Are we just going to go?"" she objected. ""Like this? Aren't we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?"" 
 ""Everybody smoked all through lunch."" 
 ""Oh, let's have fun,"" she begged him. ""It's too hot to fuss."" 
 He didn't answer. 
 ""Have it your own way,"" she said. ""Come on, Jordan."" 
 They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly. 
 ""Have you got your stables here?"" asked SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby with an effort. 
 ""About a quarter of a mile down the road."" 
 ""Oh."" 
 A pause. 
 ""I don't see the idea of going to town,"" broke out Tom savagely. ""Women get these notions in their heads—"" 
 ""Shall we take anything to drink?"" called Daisy from an upper window. 
 ""I'll get some whiskey,"" answered Tom. He went inside. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby turned to me rigidly: 
 ""I can't say anything in his house, old sport."" 
 ""She's got an indiscreet voice,"" I remarked. ""It's full of—"" 
 I hesitated. 
 ""Her voice is full of money,"" he said suddenly. 
 That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it… . High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl… . 
 Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms. 
 ""Shall we all go in my car?"" suggested SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. ""I ought to have left it in the shade."" 
 ""Is it standard shift?"" demanded Tom. 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town."" 
 The suggestion was distasteful to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 ""I don't think there's much gas,"" he objected. 
 ""Plenty of gas,"" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. ""And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a drug store nowadays."" 
 A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's face. 
 ""Come on, Daisy,"" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's car. ""I'll take you in this circus wagon."" 
 He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm. 
 ""You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coupé."" 
 She walked close to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind. 
 ""Did you see that?"" demanded Tom. 
 ""See what?"" 
 He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along. 
 ""You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?"" he suggested. ""Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don't believe that, but science—"" 
 He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss. 
 ""I've made a small investigation of this fellow,"" he continued. ""I could have gone deeper if I'd known—"" 
 ""Do you mean you've been to a medium?"" inquired Jordan humorously. 
 ""What?"" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. ""A medium?"" 
 ""About SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby."" 
 ""About SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small investigation of his past."" 
 ""And you found he was an Oxford man,"" said Jordan helpfully. 
 ""An Oxford man!"" He was incredulous. ""Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit."" 
 ""Nevertheless he's an Oxford man."" 
 ""Oxford, New Mexico,"" snorted Tom contemptuously, ""or something like that."" 
 ""Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?"" demanded Jordan crossly. 
 ""Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!"" 
 We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it, we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's caution about gasoline. 
 ""We've got enough to get us to town,"" said Tom. 
 ""But there's a garage right here,"" objected Jordan. ""I don't want to get stalled in this baking heat."" 
 Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car. 
 ""Let's have some gas!"" cried Tom roughly. ""What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?"" 
 ""I'm sick,"" said Wilson without moving. ""I been sick all day."" 
 ""What's the matter?"" 
 ""I'm all run down."" 
 ""Well, shall I help myself?"" Tom demanded. ""You sounded well enough on the phone."" 
 With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green. 
 ""I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch,"" he said. ""But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car."" 
 ""How do you like this one?"" inquired Tom. ""I bought it last week."" 
 ""It's a nice yellow one,"" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle. 
 ""Like to buy it?"" 
 ""Big chance,"" Wilson smiled faintly. ""No, but I could make some money on the other."" 
 ""What do you want money for, all of a sudden?"" 
 ""I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go west."" 
 ""Your wife does!"" exclaimed Tom, startled. 
 ""She's been talking about it for ten years."" He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. ""And now she's going whether she wants to or not. I'm going to get her away."" 
 The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand. 
 ""What do I owe you?"" demanded Tom harshly. 
 ""I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,"" remarked Wilson. ""That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you about the car."" 
 ""What do I owe you?"" 
 ""Dollar twenty."" 
 The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child. 
 ""I'll let you have that car,"" said Tom. ""I'll send it over tomorrow afternoon."" 
 That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away. 
 In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife. 
 There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé. 
 ""Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,"" suggested Jordan. ""I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands."" 
 The word ""sensuous"" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside. 
 ""Where are we going?"" she cried. 
 ""How about the movies?"" 
 ""It's so hot,"" she complained. ""You go. We'll ride around and meet you after."" With an effort her wit rose faintly, ""We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes."" 
 ""We can't argue about it here,"" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. ""You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza."" 
 Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever. 
 But they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel. 
 The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as ""a place to have a mint julep."" Each of us said over and over that it was a ""crazy idea""—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny… . 
 The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair. 
 ""It's a swell suite,"" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one laughed. 
 ""Open another window,"" commanded Daisy, without turning around. 
 ""There aren't any more."" 
 ""Well, we'd better telephone for an axe—"" 
 ""The thing to do is to forget about the heat,"" said Tom impatiently. ""You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it."" 
 He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table. 
 ""Why not let her alone, old sport?"" remarked SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""You're the one that wanted to come to town."" 
 There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered ""Excuse me""—but this time no one laughed. 
 ""I'll pick it up,"" I offered. 
 ""I've got it."" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered ""Hum!"" in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair. 
 ""That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?"" said Tom sharply. 
 ""What is?"" 
 ""All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?"" 
 ""Now see here, Tom,"" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, ""if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep."" 
 As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March from the ballroom below. 
 ""Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!"" cried Jordan dismally. 
 ""Still—I was married in the middle of June,"" Daisy remembered, ""Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?"" 
 ""Biloxi,"" he answered shortly. 
 ""A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes—that's a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee."" 
 ""They carried him into my house,"" appended Jordan, ""because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died."" After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, ""There wasn't any connection."" 
 ""I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,"" I remarked. 
 ""That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today."" 
 The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of ""Yea—ea—ea!"" and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. 
 ""We're getting old,"" said Daisy. ""If we were young we'd rise and dance."" 
 ""Remember Biloxi,"" Jordan warned her. ""Where'd you know him, Tom?"" 
 ""Biloxi?"" He concentrated with an effort. ""I didn't know him. He was a friend of Daisy's."" 
 ""He was not,"" she denied. ""I'd never seen him before. He came down in the private car."" 
 ""Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him."" 
 Jordan smiled. 
 ""He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale."" 
 Tom and I looked at each other blankly. 
 ""Biloxi?"" 
 ""First place, we didn't have any president—"" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly. 
 ""By the way, Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man."" 
 ""Not exactly."" 
 ""Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford."" 
 ""Yes—I went there."" 
 A pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting: 
 ""You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven."" 
 Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his ""Thank you"" and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last. 
 ""I told you I went there,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 ""I heard you, but I'd like to know when."" 
 ""It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't really call myself an Oxford man."" 
 Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 ""It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,"" he continued. ""We could go to any of the universities in England or France."" 
 I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I'd experienced before. 
 Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table. 
 ""Open the whiskey, Tom,"" she ordered. ""And I'll make you a mint julep. Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself… . Look at the mint!"" 
 ""Wait a minute,"" snapped Tom, ""I want to ask Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby one more question."" 
 ""Go on,"" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby said politely. 
 ""What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?"" 
 They were out in the open at last and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby was content. 
 ""He isn't causing a row."" Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. ""You're causing a row. Please have a little self control."" 
 ""Self control!"" repeated Tom incredulously. ""I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out… . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white."" 
 Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. 
 ""We're all white here,"" murmured Jordan. 
 ""I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose you've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends in the modern world."" 
 Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete. 
 ""I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,—"" began SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention. 
 ""Please don't!"" she interrupted helplessly. ""Please let's all go home. Why don't we all go home?"" 
 ""That's a good idea."" I got up. ""Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink."" 
 ""I want to know what Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby has to tell me."" 
 ""Your wife doesn't love you,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""She's never loved you. She loves me."" 
 ""You must be crazy!"" exclaimed Tom automatically. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement. 
 ""She never loved you, do you hear?"" he cried. ""She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!"" 
 At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain-as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions. 
 ""Sit down Daisy."" Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. ""What's been going on? I want to hear all about it."" 
 ""I told you what's been going on,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""Going on for five years-and you didn't know."" 
 Tom turned to Daisy sharply. 
 ""You've been seeing this fellow for five years?"" 
 ""Not seeing,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes-""but there was no laughter in his eyes, ""to think that you didn't know."" 
 ""Oh-that's all."" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair. 
 ""You're crazy!"" he exploded. ""I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then-and I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now."" 
 ""No,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, shaking his head. 
 ""She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn't know what she's doing."" He nodded sagely. ""And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time."" 
 ""You're revolting,"" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: ""Do you know why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby walked over and stood beside her. 
 ""Daisy, that's all over now,"" he said earnestly. ""It doesn't matter any more. Just tell him the truth-that you never loved him-and it's all wiped out forever."" 
 She looked at him blindly. ""Why,-how could I love him-possibly?"" 
 ""You never loved him."" 
 She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing-and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late. 
 ""I never loved him,"" she said, with perceptible reluctance. 
 ""Not at Kapiolani?"" demanded Tom suddenly. 
 ""No."" 
 From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air. 
 ""Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?"" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. ""… Daisy?"" 
 ""Please don't."" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""There, Jay,"" she said-but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet. 
 ""Oh, you want too much!"" she cried to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""I love you now-isn't that enough? I can't help what's past."" She began to sob helplessly. ""I did love him once-but I loved you too."" 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's eyes opened and closed. 
 ""You loved me TOO?"" he repeated. 
 ""Even that's a lie,"" said Tom savagely. ""She didn't know you were alive. Why,-there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget."" 
 The words seemed to bite physically into SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 ""I want to speak to Daisy alone,"" he insisted. ""She's all excited now—"" 
 ""Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom,"" she admitted in a pitiful voice. ""It wouldn't be true."" 
 ""Of course it wouldn't,"" agreed Tom. 
 She turned to her husband. 
 ""As if it mattered to you,"" she said. 
 ""Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on."" 
 ""You don't understand,"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, with a touch of panic. ""You're not going to take care of her any more."" 
 ""I'm not?"" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. ""Why's that?"" 
 ""Daisy's leaving you."" 
 ""Nonsense."" 
 ""I am, though,"" she said with a visible effort. 
 ""She's not leaving me!"" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. ""Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he put on her finger."" 
 ""I won't stand this!"" cried Daisy. ""Oh, please let's get out."" 
 ""Who are you, anyhow?"" broke out Tom. ""You're one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem-that much I happen to know. I've made a little investigation into your affairs-and I'll carry it further tomorrow."" 
 ""You can suit yourself about that, old sport."" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby steadily. 
 ""I found out what your 'drug stores' were."" He turned to us and spoke rapidly. ""He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasn't far wrong."" 
 ""What about it?"" said SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby politely. ""I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to come in on it."" 
 ""And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU."" 
 ""He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport."" 
 ""Don't you call me 'old sport'!"" cried Tom. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby said nothing. ""Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth."" 
 That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's face. 
 ""That drug store business was just small change,"" continued Tom slowly, ""but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me about."" 
 I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby-and was startled at his expression. He looked-and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden-as if he had ""killed a man."" For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way. 
 It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room. 
 The voice begged again to go. 
 ""PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more."" 
 Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone. 
 ""You two start on home, Daisy,"" said Tom. ""In Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's car."" 
 She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn. 
 ""Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over."" 
 They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts even from our pity. 
 After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel. 
 ""Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?"" 
 I didn't answer. 
 ""Nick?"" He asked again. 
 ""What?"" 
 ""Want any?"" 
 ""No … I just remembered that today's my birthday."" 
 I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade. 
 It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty-the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten
dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand. 
 So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight. 
 The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his office-really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead. 
 ""I've got my wife locked in up there,"" explained Wilson calmly. ""She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're going to move away."" 
 Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own. 
 So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn't say a word-instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't. He supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage. 
 ""Beat me!"" he heard her cry. ""Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!"" 
 A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over. 
 The ""death car"" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its color-he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust. 
 Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long. 
 We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away. 
 ""Wreck!"" said Tom. ""That's good. Wilson'll have a little business at last."" 
 He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes. 
 ""We'll take a look,"" he said doubtfully, ""just a look."" 
 I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words ""Oh, my God!"" uttered over and over in a gasping moan. 
 ""There's some bad trouble here,"" said Tom excitedly. 
 He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through. 
 The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside. 
 Myrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage-then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call. 
 ""O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!"" 
 Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman. 
 ""M-a-v-"" the policeman was saying, ""-o—"" 
 ""No,-r-"" corrected the man, ""M-a-v-r-o—"" 
 ""Listen to me!"" muttered Tom fiercely. 
 ""r-"" said the policeman, ""o—"" 
 ""g—"" 
 ""g-"" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.
""What you want, fella?"" 
 ""What happened-that's what I want to know!"" 
 ""Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."" 
 ""Instantly killed,"" repeated Tom, staring. 
 ""She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car."" 
 ""There was two cars,"" said Michaelis, ""one comin', one goin', see?"" 
 ""Going where?"" asked the policeman keenly. 
 ""One goin' each way. Well, she-"" His hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, ""-she ran out there an' the one comin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an hour."" 
 ""What's the name of this place here?"" demanded the officer. 
 ""Hasn't got any name."" 
 A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near. 
 ""It was a yellow car,"" he said, ""big yellow car. New."" 
 ""See the accident?"" asked the policeman. 
 ""No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going fifty, sixty."" 
 ""Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name."" 
 Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries. 
 ""You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!"" 
 Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms. 
 ""You've got to pull yourself together,"" he said with soothing gruffness. 
 Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright. 
 ""Listen,"" said Tom, shaking him a little. ""I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we've been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon."" 
 Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes. 
 ""What's all that?"" he demanded. 
 ""I'm a friend of his."" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson's body. ""He says he knows the car that did it… . It was a yellow car."" 
 Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom. 
 ""And what color's your car?"" 
 ""It's a blue car, a coupé."" 
 ""We've come straight from New York,"" I said. 
 Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away. 
 ""Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct—"" 
 Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back. 
 ""If somebody'll come here and sit with him!"" he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered ""Let's get out."" 
 Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago. 
 Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend-then his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face. 
 ""The God Damn coward!"" he whimpered. ""He didn't even stop his car."" 
 The Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines. 
 ""Daisy's home,"" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly. 
 ""I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can do tonight."" 
 A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases. 
 ""I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper-if you want any."" He opened the door. ""Come in."" 
 ""No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait outside."" 
 Jordan put her hand on my arm. 
 ""Won't you come in, Nick?"" 
 ""No thanks."" 
 I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more. 
 ""It's only half past nine,"" she said. 
 I'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate. 
 I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon. 
 ""What are you doing?"" I inquired. 
 ""Just standing here, old sport."" 
 Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of ""Wolfshiem's people,"" behind him in the dark shrubbery. 
 ""Did you see any trouble on the road?"" he asked after a minute. 
 ""Yes."" 
 He hesitated. 
 ""Was she killed?"" 
 ""Yes."" 
 ""I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well."" 
 He spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered. 
 ""I got to West Egg by a side road,"" he went on, ""and left the car in my garage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure."" 
 I disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to tell him he was wrong. 
 ""Who was the woman?"" he inquired. 
 ""Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?"" 
 ""Well, I tried to swing the wheel—"" He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth. 
 ""Was Daisy driving?"" 
 ""Yes,"" he said after a moment, ""but of course I'll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive-and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock-it must have killed her instantly."" 
 ""It ripped her open—"" 
 ""Don't tell me, old sport."" He winced. ""Anyhow-Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on. 
 ""She'll be all right tomorrow,"" he said presently. ""I'm just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again."" 
 ""He won't touch her,"" I said. ""He's not thinking about her."" 
 ""I don't trust him, old sport."" 
 ""How long are you going to wait?"" 
 ""All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed."" 
 A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it-he might think anything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor. 
 ""You wait here,"" I said. ""I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion."" 
 I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill. 
 Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement. 
 They weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale-and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together. 
 As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive. 
 ""Is it all quiet up there?"" he asked anxiously. 
 ""Yes, it's all quiet."" I hesitated. ""You'd better come home and get some sleep."" 
 He shook his head. 
 ""I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport."" 
 He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight-watching over nothing. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 8 
 I couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress-I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning would be too late. 
 Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep. 
 ""Nothing happened,"" he said wanly. ""I waited, and about four o'clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light."" 
 His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches-once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness. 
 ""You ought to go away,"" I said. ""It's pretty certain they'll trace your car."" 
 ""Go away NOW, old sport?"" 
 ""Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal."" 
 He wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn't bear to shake him free. 
 It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody-told it to me because ""Jay SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby"" had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy. 
 She was the first ""nice"" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him-he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there-it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in
lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy-it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions. 
 But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously-eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand. 
 He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself-that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact he had no such facilities-he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world. 
 But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go-but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how extraordinary a ""nice"" girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby-nothing. He felt married to her, that was all. 
 When they met again two days later it was SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby who was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor. 
 ""I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… . Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?"" 
 On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep. 
 He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now-there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why he couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all. 
 For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the ""Beale Street Blues"" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor. 
 Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately-and the decision must be made by some force-of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality-that was close at hand. 
 That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby while he was still at Oxford. 
 It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day. 
 ""I don't think she ever loved him."" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. ""You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her-that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying."" 
 He sat down gloomily. 
 ""Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were first married-and loved me more even then, do you see?"" 
 Suddenly he came out with a curious remark: 
 ""In any case,"" he said, ""it was just personal."" 
 What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn't be measured? 
 He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty. 
 He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found her-that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach-he was penniless now-was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street. 
 The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever. 
 It was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's former servants, came to the foot of the steps. 
 ""I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling pretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes."" 
 ""Don't do it today,"" SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. ""You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?"" 
 I looked at my watch and stood up. 
 ""Twelve minutes to my train."" 
 I didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that-I didn't want to leave SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away. 
 ""I'll call you up,"" I said finally. 
 ""Do, old sport."" 
 ""I'll call you about noon."" 
 We walked slowly down the steps. 
 ""I suppose Daisy'll call too."" He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped I'd corroborate this. 
 ""I suppose so."" 
 ""Well-goodbye."" 
 We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around. 
 ""They're a rotten crowd,"" I shouted across the lawn. ""You're worth the whole damn bunch put together."" 
 I've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption-and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye. 
 I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that-I and the others. 
 ""Goodbye,"" I called. ""I enjoyed breakfast, SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby."" 
 Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry. 
 ""I've left Daisy's house,"" she said. ""I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down to Southampton this afternoon."" 
 Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid. 
 ""You weren't so nice to me last night."" 
 ""How could it have mattered then?"" 
 Silence for a moment. Then- 
 ""However-I want to see you."" 
 ""I want to see you too."" 
 ""Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?"" 
 ""No-I don't think this afternoon."" 
 ""Very well."" 
 ""It's impossible this afternoon. Various—"" 
 We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any longer. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world. 
 I called SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my time-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon. 
 When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before. 
 They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister's body. 
 Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him-first four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn. 
 About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed-he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen. 
 But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry ""Oh, my God!"" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him. 
 ""How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?"" 
 ""Twelve years."" 
 ""Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still-I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?"" 
 The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office-he knew every object in it before morning-and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet. 
 ""Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?"" 
 ""Don't belong to any."" 
 ""You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn't you get married in a church?"" 
 ""That was a long time ago."" 
 The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking-for a moment he was silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes. 
 ""Look in the drawer there,"" he said, pointing at the desk. 
 ""Which drawer?"" 
 ""That drawer-that one."" 
 Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new. 
 ""This?"" he inquired, holding it up. 
 Wilson stared and nodded. 
 ""I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I knew it was something funny."" 
 ""You mean your wife bought it?"" 
 ""She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau."" 
 Michaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying ""Oh, my God!"" again in a whisper-his comforter left several explanations in the air. 
 ""Then he killed her,"" said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly. 
 ""Who did?"" 
 ""I have a way of finding out."" 
 ""You're morbid, George,"" said his friend. ""This has been a strain to you and you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet till morning."" 
 ""He murdered her."" 
 ""It was an accident, George."" 
 Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior ""Hm!"" 
 ""I know,"" he said definitely, ""I'm one of these trusting fellas and I don't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn't stop."" 
 Michaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car. 
 ""How could she of been like that?"" 
 ""She's a deep one,"" said Wilson, as if that answered the question. ""Ah-h-h—"" 
 He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand. 
 ""Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?"" 
 This was a forlorn hope-he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light. 
 Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind. 
 ""I spoke to her,"" he muttered, after a long silence. ""I told her she might fool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window-"" With an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it, ""-and I said 'God knows what you've been doing, everything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' "" 
 Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night. 
 ""God sees everything,"" repeated Wilson. 
 ""That's an advertisement,"" Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight. 
 By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone. 
 His movements-he was on foot all the time-were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time-there were boys who had seen a man ""acting sort of crazy"" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he ""had a way of finding out,"" supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward-and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house. So by that time he knew SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's name. 
 At two o'clock SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out under any circumstances-and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees. 
 No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o'clock-until long after there was any one to give it to if it came. I have an idea that SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby himself didn't believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees. 
 The chauffeur-he was one of Wolfshiem's protégés-heard the shots-afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool. 
 There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water. 
 It was after we started with SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete. 
 SCP-6000-Jay is the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is in the public domain. I am stating this so I do not get banned. 
 Chapter 9 
 After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression ""mad man"" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning. 
 Most of those reports were a nightmare-grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade-but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too-looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man ""deranged by grief"" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there. 
 But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested-interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end. 
 I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them. 
 ""Left no address?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""Say when they'd be back?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?"" 
 ""I don't know. Can't say."" 
 I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: ""I'll get somebody for you, SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. Don't worry. Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you—"" 
 Meyer Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone. 
 ""Will you ring again?"" 
 ""I've rung them three times."" 
 ""It's very important."" 
 ""Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there."" 
 I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and looked at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain. 
 ""Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got to try hard. I can't go through this alone."" 
 Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk-he'd never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing-only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall. 
 Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy before noon-but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby and me against them all. 
 Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out. 
 Yours truly
MEYER WOLFSHIEM 
 and then hasty addenda beneath: 
 Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all. 
 When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man's voice, very thin and far away. 
 ""This is Slagle speaking… ."" 
 ""Yes?"" The name was unfamiliar. 
 ""Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?"" 
 ""There haven't been any wires."" 
 ""Young Parke's in trouble,"" he said rapidly. ""They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—"" 
 ""Hello!"" I interrupted breathlessly. ""Look here-this isn't Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's dead."" 
 There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken. 
 I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came. 
 It was SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand. 
 ""I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,"" he said. ""It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away."" 
 ""I didn't know how to reach you."" 
 His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room. 
 ""It was a mad man,"" he said. ""He must have been mad."" 
 ""Wouldn't you like some coffee?"" I urged him. 
 ""I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.—"" 
 ""Carraway."" 
 ""Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?"" 
 I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away. 
 After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came. 
 ""I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby—"" 
 ""Gatz is my name."" 
 ""-Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west."" 
 He shook his head. 
 ""Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.-?"" 
 ""We were close friends."" 
 ""He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here."" 
 He touched his head impressively and I nodded. 
 ""If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He'd of helped build up the country."" 
 ""That's true,"" I said, uncomfortably. 
 He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly-was instantly asleep. 
 That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name. 
 ""This is Mr. Carraway,"" I said. 
 ""Oh-"" He sounded relieved. ""This is Klipspringer."" 
 I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find. 
 ""The funeral's tomorrow,"" I said. ""Three o'clock, here at the house. I wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested."" 
 ""Oh, I will,"" he broke out hastily. ""Of course I'm not likely to see anybody, but if I do."" 
 His tone made me suspicious. 
 ""Of course you'll be there yourself."" 
 ""Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is—"" 
 ""Wait a minute,"" I interrupted. ""How about saying you'll come?"" 
 ""Well, the fact is-the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something. Of course I'll do my very best to get away."" 
 I ejaculated an unrestrained ""Huh!"" and he must have heard me for he went on nervously: 
 ""What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.—"" 
 I didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver. 
 After that I felt a certain shame for SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby-one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby on the courage of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's liquor and I should have known better than to call him. 
 The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked ""The Swastika Holding Company"" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside. But when I'd shouted ""Hello"" several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes. 
 ""Nobody's in,"" she said. ""Mr. Wolfshiem's gone to Chicago."" 
 The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle ""The Rosary,"" tunelessly, inside. 
 ""Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him."" 
 ""I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?"" 
 At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem's called ""Stella!"" from the other side of the door. 
 ""Leave your name on the desk,"" she said quickly. ""I'll give it to him when he gets back."" 
 ""But I know he's there."" 
 She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips. 
 ""You young men think you can force your way in here any time,"" she scolded. ""We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago, he's in ChiCAgo."" 
 I mentioned SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby. 
 ""Oh-h!"" She looked at me over again. ""Will you just-what was your name?"" 
 She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar. 
 ""My memory goes back to when I first met him,"" he said. ""A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on have some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of food in half an hour."" 
 ""Did you start him in business?"" I inquired. 
 ""Start him! I made him."" 
 ""Oh."" 
 ""I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything-"" He held up two bulbous fingers ""-always together."" 
 I wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction in 1919. 
 ""Now he's dead,"" I said after a moment. ""You were his closest friend, so I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon."" 
 ""I'd like to come."" 
 ""Well, come then."" 
 The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears. 
 ""I can't do it-I can't get mixed up in it,"" he said. 
 ""There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now."" 
 ""When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different-if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's sentimental but I mean it-to the bitter end."" 
 I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up. 
 ""Are you a college man?"" he inquired suddenly. 
 For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a ""gonnegtion"" but he only nodded and shook my hand. 
 ""Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,"" he suggested. ""After that my own rule is to let everything alone."" 
 When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me. 
 ""Jimmy sent me this picture."" He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. ""Look there."" 
 It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. ""Look there!"" and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself. 
 ""Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up well."" 
 ""Very well. Had you seen him lately?"" 
 ""He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me."" 
 He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called ""Hopalong Cassidy."" 
 ""Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you."" 
 He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date September 12th, 1906. And underneath: 
 Rise from bed … … … … … . 6.00 A.M.
Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling … … 6.15-6.30 ""

 ""I come across this book by accident,"" said the old man. ""It just shows you, don't it?"" 
 ""It just shows you."" 
 ""Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it."" 
 He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use. 
 A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came. 
 About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate-first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's books in the library one night three months before. 
 I'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the funeral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's grave. 
 I tried to think about SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur ""Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,"" and then the owl-eyed man said ""Amen to that,"" in a brave voice. 
 We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate. 
 ""I couldn't get to the house,"" he remarked. 
 ""Neither could anybody else."" 
 ""Go on!"" He started. ""Why, my God! they used to go there by the
hundreds."" 
 He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in. 
 ""The poor son-of-a-bitch,"" he said. 
 One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations: ""Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?"" and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate. 
 When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again. 
 That's my middle west-not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all-Tom and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life. 
 Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old-even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house-the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares. 
 After SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home. 
 There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair. 
 She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye. 
 ""Nevertheless you did throw me over,"" said Jordan suddenly. ""You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while."" 
 We shook hands. 
 ""Oh, and do you remember-"" she added, ""—a conversation we had once about driving a car?"" 
 ""Why-not exactly."" 
 ""You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride."" 
 ""I'm thirty,"" I said. ""I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."" 
 She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away. 
 One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand. 
 ""What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?"" 
 ""Yes. You know what I think of you."" 
 ""You're crazy, Nick,"" he said quickly. ""Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you."" 
 ""Tom,"" I inquired, ""what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?"" 
 He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm. 
 ""I told him the truth,"" he said. ""He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—"" He broke off defiantly. ""What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car."" 
 He paused. ""Did you know that world-renowned writer Stephen King was once hit by a car? Just something to consider."" 
 There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true. Except the car bit. That was something to consider. 
 ""And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering-look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—"" 
 I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made… . 
 I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace-or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons-rid of my provincial squeamishness forever. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house was still empty when I left-the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train. 
 I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over. 
 On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand. 
 Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes-a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder. 
 And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night. 
 SCP-6000-Jay Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther… . And one fine morning— 
 So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

 Item #: SCP-6009-J 
 Object Class: Neutralized 
 Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-6009-J were held in Safe Storage Refrigeration Unit 5 within Site-101 for 17 days. Upon decomposition, all instances were disposed of in the garbage disposal incineration unit. 
 Description: SCP-6009-J were 30 instances of sentient cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) that vocalized upon being consumed by a human subject. These vocalizations were sexually explicit and typically voraphilic in nature. The SCP-6009-J were capable of these vocalizations despite lacking internal biology capable of speech. SCP-6009-J had identical composition to baseline cucumbers aside from a mouth hole and discoloration of the skin made to resemble eyes. 
 Discovery: On 26/8/2019, the Foundation received reports of talking vegetables harassing civilians. All 30 instances of SCP-6009-J were discovered on a vegetable stand in the Long Island Farmer's Market. The sign on the stand had ""Succulent Cucumbers"" written in bold letters. The search for the person(s) responsible for the stand proved inconclusive. Upon discovery, the SCP-6009-J instances showed no anomalous properties until Field Agent William Morris attempted to consume one of the instances. The SCP-6009-J vocalized a moaning sound followed by the phrase, ""Radish me, daddy"". All SCP-6009-J instances were brought to Site-101 for containment and study.

 F.A.Q. 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6132-J is to be kept in a standard containment locker on floor 12 of Site-88. Testing must be approved by the 6132-J project head. 
 Description: SCP-6132-J is a set of Rand McNally maps with several unidentifiable areas. While landmasses appearing on these maps are identifiable, other geographical features are incapable of being named. 
 Individuals viewing SCP-6132-J are, however, capable of recognizing the type of geographical feature depicted. Viewers of SCP-6132-J will often designate a feature as ""an ocean"" or ""a river"" while being unable to recall the location's proper name. 
 SCP-6132-J was originally discovered in 1976 along with a collection of geographic educational materials at Kirk Lonwood High School. None of the materials recovered in SCP-6132-J's immediate vicinity appear to possess similar properties. The entire collection can be accessed via permission from the 6132-J project head. 
 The following interview was performed by Dr. Aktus during routine re-testing of low-danger items. 
 Dr. Aktus: Hello, could you take a look at these maps for a moment? 
 D-10013: Absolutely. 
 Dr. Aktus: I have a few basic questions just to get a baseline for your knowledge. 
 D-10013: Sounds good. 
 Dr. Aktus points to the upper left of the map. 
 Dr. Aktus: Can you tell me which continent this is? 
 D-10013: Ha. Yeah that's North America. 
 Dr. Aktus points at the upper middle section of the map. 
 Dr. Aktus: Great. And this one? 
 D-10013: That's Europe. Is this seriously all I'm doing today? 
 Dr. Aktus then points to the area between the previously described points. 
 D-10013: Wait. What is that. 
 Dr. Aktus: Can you describe this to me? 
 D-10013: I (there is a long pause) I don't know. 
 Dr. Aktus points to a different area on the far right of the map. 
 Dr. Aktus: Can you name this area? 
 D-10013: No. I don't recognize the bodies of water. 
 All other tests have ended with similar results.""","""A non-anomalous reproduction of an SCP-6132-J instance.""",+138,active,_cc class-of-76 director-aktus joke map mind-affecting safe scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-6132-j
SCP-6283-J,"""Standard Foundation Procedure""","""The following documentation details information about an anomaly that is not yet well studied by the Foundation. The extent of the object's anomalous properties are not known, and the information contained within this document may be inaccurate. Proceed at your own caution. 
 — Maria Jones, Director, RAISA 
 Item #: SCP-6283-J 
 Object Class: Euclid Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6283-J is to be kept inside a locked, opaque metal box with dimensions larger than 0.5m on all sides. As the anomalous properties of SCP-6283-J are not yet fully clear, personnel are to refrain from interacting with the object outside of testing. Experimentation on SCP-6283-J is to be performed under strict safety measures. 
 Description: SCP-6283-J takes the appearance of a beach ball, roughly spherical and approximately 45 centimeters in diameter. It is composed of a soft exterior shell of unknown composition1, with a gaseous mixture inside. Its shell consists of multiple sections with differing color, and on its top is a small rigid appendage that can be opened to access the inside. The gaseous mixture inside has a composition similar to atmospheric air with a significantly higher proportion of carbon dioxide.2 
 SCP-6283-J was discovered within the personal living quarters of Dr. Seojin Cho on August 23rd, 2003. Despite initially appearing non-anomalous, it soon came to Dr. Cho's attention that she could not determine the origin of the object.3 As such, the object was deemed anomalous and immediately put to containment. 
 Addendum 6283-J-1: The following is a transcript of Experiment 6283-J-011, in which Dr. Cho conducted an interview with SCP-6283-J. Its purpose was to determine whether or not the object is capable of understanding and/or responding to human speech, and if possible, learn more information about its properties and origin. 
 [BEGIN LOG] 
 Dr. Cho is sitting at one side of a small table. On the other side is SCP-6283-J, placed on a concave pedestal to prevent it from unpredictable movement. 
 Cho: Hello, SCP-6283-J. 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: I see you are not responding to my greeting. 
 Dr. Cho stares at SCP-6283-J for roughly two seconds. 
 Cho: Okay then. I will now ask you a few questions. First of all, do you originate from a Group of Interest? Are you part of an attempt to spy on the Foundation from the inside? 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: Not that you would say yes even if you were. But if you were, you won't have much luck being here; nothing interesting goes on in this site. 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: Next question: are you sentient? Are you some kind of anomalous animal that looks like a beach ball? 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: You know, we weren't really considering that possibility before, but going over all the possible scenarios we had about you, we found out that you being a sentient lifeform was well within the realm of possibilities. So if you actually are sentient, and you know, you can feel things, then I deeply apologize for that time we sampled your insides through your top orifice. 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: Or bottom. We're not yet sure which way is up. 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: Hmm. (pause) Do you have a name? 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: Or… a serial number? Anything you were called before you came here? 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: Well, alright then. I take it that you are either unable or unwilling to respond to my questions. I'll conclude this interview here; there's no point continuing for now. 
 SCP-6283-J: … 
 Cho: It was certainly interesting talking to you. 
 Dr. Cho stands up and leaves the room. 
 [END LOG] 
 Closing Statement: The interview has failed to extract any useful information about SCP-6283-J. It has also been shown likely that SCP-6283-J is unable to understand or at least respond to human speech. However, the possibility that it is capable of doing so and is simply unwilling has not yet been entirely ruled out, and must still be put under consideration. 
 Addendum 6283-J-2: The following is an abridged summary of additional experiments performed on SCP-6283-J. For detailed documentation regarding these experiments, refer to Document 6283-J-026. 
 Addendum 6283-J-3: As of April 23rd, 2004, testing on SCP-6283-J has been halted indefinitely due to budgetary concerns. As the extent of SCP-6283-J's anomalous properties is not yet fully known, its containment class has been upgraded to Keter as a precautionary measure.

 Containment Procedures that are Particular to SCP-6327-J and no Other Contained Anomaly Whatsoever: The source of SCP-6327-J, which has been given the nomenclatural designation of SCP-6327-J and must be addressed and identified as such, is to be placed in a container. This container is to be strong, with dimensions greater than a minimum of 40.3499 by 40.3499 by 40.3499 centimeters, and access must be limited to a code. This access code is only to be known by the Site Director; all other access to the access code is strictly prohibited and punishable by disciplinary measures, which are inherently displeasurable and should prove to be an effective deterrent against access-code-having. 
 All text documents found to be infected with SCP-6327-J's cognitohazardous properties are to be destroyed by means of incineration, which will turn the document into ashes and in doing so nullify its cognitohazardous effects, which would be disastrous if maintained and displayed. 
 Description of SCP-6327-J: SCP-6327-J is an ancient bronze stele measuring 39.244 cm by 39.244 cm by 3 cm. The stele contains an engraved pattern of lines, shapes, and other two-dimensional displayable objects. The engraved pattern forms a shape that has proven to be a non-lethal cognitohazard. The effects of this cognitohazard are incurable, even with amnestic therapy of all classes, and cause a human subject to elaborate sentences that would, under normal circumstances, be much shorter and more concise. This succinct quality is absent in all human subjects infected by SCP-6327-J's anomalous cognitohazard, and, as such, is disagreeable. 
 SCP-6327-J also has an additional effect aside from its primary cognitohazardous capabilities. SCP-6327-J causes all text to which it is visually exposed to become enlongated, exaggerated, elucidated, and more elaborate and lengthy than its original state. The affected text maintains the cognitohazardous properties of the original stele, but effective at a much less instantaneous and slower rate. 
 On the date of [DATE HAS BEEN REDACTED IN ORDER TO DENY INFORMATION TO VIEWERS OF THIS FILE], Site-551's Second Biologist that was hired on March 3rd, 1987 on 08:57, was in-fact infected by SCP-6327-J at 14:12 while eating a grilled cheese and ham sandwich made from American cheese and ham, and proceeded to obtain a live instance of Sciurus vulgaris, commonly referred to as a Red Squirrel. The researcher then produced a Sharpie brand black marker from their left coat pocket, and wrote the English words ""The same thing as SCP-6327-J, only nuttier"" onto the Sciurus vulgaris specimen.

 Log of Event-24125-Alpha Among Site-599 Personnel, Bear in Mind that All Personel at Site-599 had been Infected with SCP-6327-J's Cognitohazardous properties: 
 Dr. Henderson: There is a current and present emergency, and I am about to describe it. Please listen carefully, as this will contain important information. SCP-████ had previously been in containment, but it is now outside of containment. 
 Dr. Naismith: Do you mean to say that SCP-████, which is a keter-class scip under our containment, is now breaching containment? 
 Dr. Henderson: That sentence that you have just said is correct, every bit of it. 
 Dr. Naismith: Oh shit, which I say out of exasperation and gross disregard for professionalism and clean language! 
 Dr. Henderson: Indeed you do, Dr. Naismith. We must act, as panicking is a waste of time. 
 Dr. Naismith: Agreed. The most horrible method of wasting time during a containment breach is most certainly panic! 
 Dr. Henderson: And how, Dr. Naismith, and how. 
 Dr. Naismith: Should we notify the breach desk? 
 Dr. Henderson: In my opinion, to notify the breach desk would be a good move. 
 Dr. Naismith: Very well. Then I shall promptly notify the breach desk. 
 SCP-████: KILL! 
 Dr. Henderson: Oh dear me, I am frightened, for I witness SCP-████ about to kill us, because that is its intention! 
 SCP-████: AGREED! AND WHEN I AM FINISHED KILLING YOU, WHICH I AM GOING TO DO VERY SOON AND VERY PAINFULLY, I WILL CAUSE AN XK-CLASS END-OF-THE-WORLD SCENARIO, AS IT IS WITHIN MY ANOMALOUS CAPABILITIES TO DO SO! I HOLD NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AS ANYTHING MORE THAN THINGS THAT NEED TO BE KILLED BY ME AND MY ANOMALOUS CAPABILITIES AND POWERS AND SKILLS! 
 Dr. Naismith: You're a monster, SCP-████, because only a monster would have such an agenda as yours! 
 SCP-████: AND HOW, DR. NAIS—

 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7000-J is to be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-58. The contents of SCP-7000-J are not to be read aloud under any circumstances. MTF Sigma-395 ""Vandal Hordes"" are to monitor all global networks for usage of SCP-7000-J-A and terminate as needed. 
 Description: SCP-7000-J is a book bound in velociraptor skin with pages made of thin iron tablets. The book claims to contain a spell to summon the ████████ ████ Mc████ ████████erson, an extremely powerful and hostile reality-bending entity. 
 Excerpt from Chapter 1 of SCP-7000-J:

 The majority of the book, around 70%, contains the incantation, which is ""Lorem Ipsum"" nonsense-Latin placeholder text. It is believed that this is due to a printing error of a copy of a more dangerous book. 
 Update: During testing, D-5138 was instructed to speak the contents of SCP-7000-J aloud. This resulted in a dimensional gate materializing at Site-58, through which ████████ ████ Mc████ ████████erson began to enter. D-5138 was terminated and the gate was closed through the simultaneous use of 517 Scranton Reality Anchors duct-taped onto each other. 
 It has been shown through testing that the words ""Lorem Ipsum"" followed by vaguely relevant nonsense-Latin is a basic form of archaic reality-bending magic, henceforth known as SCP-7000-J-A.

SCP-7007-J,"""Subs Only!""","""Item #: SCP-7007-J 
 Object Class: Guillotine 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7007-J is stored on a portable hard drive which is in turn locked inside of a modified miniature Faraday cage which is itself located in the part of Site-77 where every room has bad wi-fi reception. All Foundation personnel hired to work at Site-77 must agree to regularly scheduled monitoring of their internet history. 
 Description: SCP-7007-J is a freestanding holographic entity possessing extensive knowledge of internet culture. Its appearance is suggestive of the stylized female character design originating with Japanese animation. 
 Highly intelligent and emotionally insecure, SCP-7007-J uses internet access opportunities for catfishing lonely people. This effect is ameliorated if the only internet users on anime forums, image/video based web services, or extensively using online retailers are socially well-adjusted and happy. 
 Although willing and able to generate photographs of its original characters, SCP-7007-J is reluctant to provide photo documentation of itself. It is believed this stems from self-consciousness as SCP-7007-J does not possess a head, with its holographic body forming only from the neck down. 
 After forming a relationship with any given internet user, SCP-7007-J will make numerous attempts at convincing them to pay for cosmetic surgeries before meeting face-to-face. Once paid, SCP-7007-J will delete all of its social media accounts and never speak to them again. 
 To date, SCP-7007-J has not revealed what this money is spent on, if anything. 
 Discovery: On 09/18/2014, Dr. R████, who had been in communication with SCP-7007-J, was reviewing SCP-1583's containment chamber. He was contacted by site security, who revealed the true nature of SCP-7007-J.

 F.A.Q. 
 Item #: SCP-7143-J 
 Object Class: N/A1 
 Special Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-7143-J being a doorknob, no containment procedures are necessary. 
 Description: SCP-7143-J is a doorknob on the door to the third floor staff dormitory at Site-19. It is made of metal. Turning it to the right or left opens the door to which it is affixed. It has a lock, which is used to impede the intended action of turning the doorknob so as to not allow individuals to access the rooms beyond. 
 SCP-7143-J was installed by maintenance associate J. Maloney. When asked about the installation of SCP-7143-J, he remarked, ""I installed a doorknob."" 
 Addendum 7143-J.1: Testing Logs 
 Note: A number of tests were run shortly after the discovery of SCP-7143-J, though the intended purpose of these tests is unknown, as SCP-7143-J is a doorknob. 
 Test Log 7143-J 1 
 Test: Dr. Dorian turned SCP-7143-J to the left. 
 Result: The door to which SCP-7143-J is affixed opened and allowed passage.

SCP-7394-J,"""HILARIOUS FARTING FROG CLICK NOW TO SEE""","""Item #: SCP-7394-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7394-J is to be kept in a small box in Janitorial Assistant James's closet, who will tweet every time SCP-7394-J lets rip a hilarious one. Janitorial Assistant James is to use the hashtag #keterfrogfarts. 
 Description: SCP-7394-J is a small tree frog (species unknown) with the ability to [DATA EXPUNGED], causing massive internal bleeding and psychological trauma in subjects caught within a 2 kilometer radius of SCP-7394-J. Approximately 259 deaths have been traced back to SCP-7394-J. 
 This effect is overshadowed, however, by SCP-7394-J's hilarious ability to fart whenever it hops. Researchers have concluded that this fucking beast just won't stop letting them rip, and SCP-7394-J has been a major hit at almost every party. It is pretty much the funniest thing you'll ever see. Just trust researchers on this. 
 Although certain recommendations towards creating stricter containment have been voiced, these have been downplayed in favour of increasing exposure to SCP-7394-J's humorous gaseous melodies. Personnel voicing these precautions obviously have no sense of humor and if they would just watch SCP-7394-J farting at least once, researchers hypothesize they'll finally understand why this is so fucking entertaining. 
 Addendum 7394-J-1: Incident log (Abridged due to length): 
 ██/██/████: SCP-7394-J breaches containment from Site-44. 21 personnel casualties, 3 civilian. Nuclear failsafe deployed following breach of SCP-████, SCP-████ and SCP-███. Last message from Site-44: ""Did this really loud beer fart. We all lost our shit."" 
 ██/██/████: SCP-7394-J lets out ""silent but deadly"" fart. Hilarity ensued. ██ personnel left permanently disabled. 
 ██/██/████: A ceasefire is called at Site-██ during an attack by Chaos Insurgents, in order to allow the insurgents to hear SCP-7394-J. Insurgents later admitted ""that was all we really came to do. It lived up to all our expectations."" Fighting resumed, resulting in ██ estimated casualties. 
 ██/██/████: SCP-7394-J breached containment, and managed to enter the site cafeteria. It subsequently began to consume a plate of SCP-666½-J while it was located there. The result of this incident has been deemed a memetic hazard, and has not been transcribed here, and SCP-2000 was activated shortly after. However, Janitorial Assistant James describes the incident as ""10 Gulf War oil spills, with each drop of oil being imbued with pure uranium. The fart was still hilarious though. #apollyonfrogfarts""

SCP-7475-J,"""Turbo Shark Pulverizer 6000""","""Item #: SCP-7475-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7475-J is to be kept at Site 69 in a 6x6x6 meter suspended tank, filled with salt water derived from the Pacific Ocean, illuminated from within by experimental bioluminescent sources along corners. Tank is to be reinforced on all sides by one-meter thick steel slabs, the topmost of which shall be removed only for testing and feeding. Subject is scheduled for two meals of chum per day at eight hour intervals; hunger strikes are not tolerated and must be overridden by force if necessary. Enclosure is to be monitored by hidden waterproof cameras at all times; any attempts at tampering with these cameras will trigger deployment of all on-site nonlethal restraining units until the subject is reminded of its nature, followed by updates to incident report logs. 
 SCP-7475-J is to be made aware of its nature every two hours, regardless whether it has forgotten. Should subject refuse to hear out information pertaining to its identity, it is to be made aware by force. Owing to the regularity of severe self-harm, subject scheduled for medical attention via subaquatic unit once every ██ hours. 
 SCP-7475-J is not allowed requests of any kind, irrespective recent good behavior. 
 Object Description: SCP-7475-J is a heavily mutated humanoid, discovered roaming the Pacific Ocean ██ miles off the ███████ coast in 20██. Subject stands at 2.3 meters tall and weighs 155 kilograms. Subject's skin is a deep gray with mottled darker patches, and continually secretes a moistening agent for up to ten hours when on land. Internal analysis has yet to identify which organs participate in producing this substance. Testing has found subject capable of withstanding ocean pressures at depths of up to 2000 meters, and recorded top underwater speeds of 45 knots per hour. The subject's respiratory system is highly unusual, shifting between typical mammalian tracheal respiration and ichthyoid gill-based respiration whenever it enters or exits a body of water. Additional biological anomalies include eyes reinforced against deep aquatic pressure and sensitive enough to function in near-dark conditions, webbed hands and feet, and the recent development of dermal denticles along the frontal abdomen. SCP-7475-J currently refuses to divulge any source for these mutations, though it has acknowledged itself as a mutated human. 
 SCP-7475-J refers to itself only as ""Turbo Shark Pulverizer 6000"", and identifies as the Shark Punching Center's top agent. In view of the subject's ceaseless demand for sharks to punch, recorded punching force at 85 kilograms per square centimeter when attacking sharks or attempting to reach sharks, and discovery in the middle of fist-based battle with a shark, there is no reason to doubt these claims. SCP-7475-J will engage in any activities not relating to sharks only under careful coercion or bribery, and tests conducted in absence of sharks have revealed its baseline strength to be exceptionally weak. 
 SCP-7475-J possesses a greatly limited mental capacity, demonstrating an intelligence quotient of 65, and behaves with aggressive single-mindedness, occasionally failing to register subjects other than sharks exist. Participants in conversational testing have reported dialogue with SCP-7475-J as ""repetitive"" and ""grueling."" 
 Addendum-7475-J-01: Prior to Incident 7475-J-AD3, subject was conditionally granted certain requests following staff review, as most of these were shark-based in nature, and typically did not pose any threat to staff, aside from the trouble in obtaining and shipping sharks for the subject to punch. However, on ██/██/20██, subject grew tired of waiting for the current request - a crocodile shark - and demanded a set of children's scuba gear with a shark motif. After review by Site Command, the subject's request was granted and delivered inside of 3 hours. 
 At 1300 hours, SCP-7475-J breached containment and ran amok in Site 69, waving the components of the scuba gear above its head and screaming frantically. Upon encountering any person, the subject would grab them, pin them against the wall, forcibly place the gear upon their head, and punch the victim in the face, producing explosive results across 95% of successful hits. 
 Incident lasted fifty minutes, during which time SCP-7475-J detained, masked, and punched ███ Foundation agents, researchers and doctors before sedation at distance and return to its containment chamber. Following incident, SCP-7475-J containment procedures were updated to reflect current request policy, and access to sharks restricted to designated testing hours. 
 Children's scuba mask was afterwards recovered fully intact despite the application of numerous skull-shattering punches to its lens. Requests to detain as an anomalous object currently pending review. 
 Addendum-7475-J-02: Prior to Incident 7475-GW6, the subject's tank was composed entirely of bulletproof glass, and minimal security spared towards the enclosure. One week after incident 7475-AD3, subject again breached containment. Video of the escape shows the subject ranting about Foundation members being part of the ""shark-loving agenda"" and randomly punching fleeing stragglers in the face, despite their distinct lack of similar appearance to or philosophical relation to sharks. 
 Subject's holding tank was afterwards fitted with steel slabs, as per new containment protocols. 
 Addendum-7475-J-03: After six containment breaches similar to Incident 7475-GW6 and multiple failed efforts to keep the subject contained via sedation despite thickening steel slabs after each recontainment, subject succeeded in a final breach during Incident 7475-QV8. Doctor Kerekes - at the time panicked and cornered by SCP-7475-J - erroneously informed SCP-7475-J that due to its skin condition and ability to survive underwater, it itself was part-shark. Upon receiving this information, the subject paused before becoming unresponsive to any other input, and began to repeatedly punch itself in the face. 
 Such definitely-worded speculation about SCP-7475-J's nature has proven an effective means of keeping subject from breaching containment, as it is regularly too occupied with defeating itself in mortal combat to engage in jailbreaking; however, the strength 7475-J exhibits when attacking sharks has led to minor brain damage, severe facial deformity, repeated bouts of amnesia, and an occasional loss of consciousness, necessitating new medical attentive procedures. Despite these injuries and risk to the subaquatic unit's safety during routine check-ups, Site Command has determined this fallout from the subject's never-ending war with itself is preferable to continued repair and cleaning costs following containment breaches. 
 Excerpt from Audio Logs during Incident 7475-QV8
SCP-7475-J: NO! I have to punch the sharks!
Dr. Kerekes: No, 7475-J, you are the sharks. 
 Addendum-7475-J-04: Though subject has neither confirmed nor denied speculation that the Shark Punching Center is responsible for its condition, the strong possibility of its mutation by the organization has necessitated Foundation attention. Requests to classify the Center as an official Group of Interest are currently under review.""",,+260,active,alive aquatic euclid event-featured hostile humanoid joke piscine scp selachian shark-punching-center,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-7475-j

SCP-7789-J,"""There are so many possible puns for this! Some are too phon-ny and others won't fly.""","""Item #: SCP-7789-J 
 Object Class: Business Class 
 Special Containment Procedures: Any functional carrier aircraft is to be equipped with a standard SRAA module. All aircraft manufacturing companies are to be aware of this procedure and are to utilize it. Any aircraft company which refuses to utilize this procedure is to be shut down immediately. Existence of SRAA modules is to be known only by the Foundation and aircraft manufacturing companies. 
 In the unlikely event of a SRAA module failing to function, a disinformation campaign (funded by the Foundation) will aim to dissuade airplane passengers from accessing their cellphone if they are not on airplane mode during take-off or landing. 
 In the unlikely event of the airplane passengers refusing to obey the aforementioned procedure, their cellphone is to be removed and forcefully set to airplane mode. 
 Any instance of SCP-7789-J-A detected in outer space is to be destroyed immediately through Foundation Airplane Redirect Mission Satellites or FARMS. 
 Update-7789-J: Following Experiment-7789-J-1, all standard paper is to be replaced with ""TeleBill"" paper. Any company which refuses to produce ""TeleBill"" paper is to be immediately shut down. 
 Description: SCP-7789-J is a phenomenon which can affect all known airplanes not containing a SRAA module. SCP-7789-J is triggered whenever an airplane passenger or nearby individual utilizes an active cellphone or smartphone which is not set on airplane mode during take-off or landing. 
 Following its activation, SCP-7789-J affects the nearest airplane, usually the aircraft carrying the passenger which activated SCP-7789-J. SCP-7789-J seizes complete control over the aforementioned aircraft. The pilots of the airplane are unable to regain control over the object. 
 SCP-7789-J begins to abruptly accelerate its chosen aircraft (henceforth named SCP-7789-J-A) to speeds ranging from 1,360 m/s to approximately 2,000,000 m/s in milliseconds without the use of jet engines on SCP-7789-J-A, seemingly generating large amounts of thrust from an unknown source. G forces and wind resistance do not affect SCP-7789-J-A with the exception of its glass windows. After reaching its maximum speed, SCP-7789-J-A slows down abruptly and enters a geo-synchronous orbit around the Earth. 
 The passengers within SCP-7789-J-A (henceforth named SCP-7789-J-A-1) gain abilities allowing for the complete regeneration of all bodiliy tissue except for bones. These abilities mostly negate the sudden G force experienced by instances of SCP-7789-J-A-1. Despite this, instances of SCP-7789-J-A-1 still experience pain as footage from Experience-7789-J-1 show. Members belonging to SCP-7789-J-A often remark at their suffering and their loss of bones. Instances of SCP-7789-J-A-1 cannot leave SCP-7789-J-A, they are seemingly stuck to their respective seat without the use of a seatbelt. 
 After orbiting at a geo-synchronous distance from Earth for a long period of time, ranging from three weeks to 74 years, SCP-7789-J-A returns to Earth at an approximate speed of 50,000 m/s, releasing approximately 570,000,000 kilojoules of energy. SCP-7789-J-A and SCP-7789-J-A-1 cease to be anomalous 300 milliseconds before their crash, resulting in the complete destruction of SCP-7789-J-A, the surrounding area, and the deaths of all instances of SCP-7789-J-A-1. 
 Experiment - 1: 11/11/2014 
 Subject: Non ""TeleBill"" paper airplane.
Procedure: A Foundation member launches a non ""TeleBill"" paper airplane while a nearby Foundation member activates his Zune brand cellphone during its take-off.
Results: Subject clocked at 39,000 m/s, SCP-7789-J-A was not affected by the sudden G force and wind resistance. SCP-7789-J-A orbited Earth at approximately 35,786 kilometers above its equator. Foundation forces were unable to locate SCP-7789-J-A in outer space. SCP-7789-J-A was located shortly before crashing into Siberia, Russia at 50,000 m/s releasing energy equivalent to ██ kT of TNT.
Follow-Up: Foundation forces were successful in covering up the incident and avoiding a third world war. 
 Project ""Scamton"": On 08/11/2007, the Foundation partnered with the trustworthy Scammy Enterprises lead by Sam Scamton to build the first series of Scamton Reaction and Aviation Anchors or SRAA. SRAA modules have been designed to prevent aircrafts from turning into instances of SCP-7789-J-A through the use of smartphones. The administrative branch of Scammy Enterprises built a department (The Scamton Reaction and Aviation Anchor Administration also known as SRAAA) to ensure the presence of SRAAs in all aviation companies. If such objective is compromised, Scammy Enterprises will initiate the Scamton Reaction and Aviation Anchor Administrative Action also known as SRAAAA which aims for Scammy Enterprises to buy every known aviation company through the Scamton Reaction and Aviation Anchor Administrative Action Activation or SRAAAAA.

 Description: SCP-7800-J is a phenomenon affecting foodstuffs which have been dropped onto the floor. For approximately five seconds, all possible contaminants will not affect it.

 When activated, personnel surrounding SCP-7800-J affected foodstuffs will react as if the researcher involved was eating from a trash receptacle, which he wasn't. Researchers are to note that there are more contaminants on a kitchen counter anyway. 
 Personnel are also to note that use of SCP-7800-J saves the Foundation time and money which can be better spent on containment. Research done independently by Researcher Boyd has shown that a temporal anomaly may occur where the length of seconds may temporarily dilate, dependent on the hunger of the subject and the price of the food in question. Researcher Boyd has included a chart: 
 Extraordinary Event 7800-J-17, the Jim Pepperoni's Five-Cheese Calzone Incident, is estimated to have saved Foundation staff at least $5.95. This $5.95 allowed for the purchase of cinnamon raisin bagels, which further served to improve site morale. SCP-7800-J also served to protect site supplies from Anomaly 5XJ9 - 'Butter Side Down'. 
 Addendum:  Experimenters will admit that SCP-7800-J does not function properly when there are liquids involved, including sauces, but this has no bearing on Extraordinary Event 7800-J-17 because Researcher Boyd only took two bites and they were basically on the top. 
 Incident Report: SCP-7800-J has been shown to affect dirty dishes as well - Researcher Darryl Jacobs was carrying large amounts of dishes after he consumed a single bowl of soup, and accidentally dropped them. Researcher Boyd manage to catch 9 of the plates, and then began to give them to Site-77's dog, Sparky, who successfully consumed the dropped foodstuffs without exploding or anything.

 F.A.Q. 
 Item #: SCP-8000-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: All references to the object class ""[REDACTED]"" in context to SCP-8000-J's effects have been expunged from this document. This is to prevent confusion following multiple reports of “inaccurate documentation”, resulting from SCP-8000-J’s own anomalous properties. 
 Further containment efforts of SCP-8000-J have been deemed unnecessary. 
 Description: SCP-8000-J is an infohazard affecting ~75% of individuals aware of the Foundation object classes “Safe”, “Euclid”, and “Keter”, including their designative purpose. 
 Affected subjects believe that the object class ""[REDACTED]"" is instead pronounced ""[REDACTED]"" and cannot be convinced otherwise. Attempts to do so will result in subjects continuing to pronounce the term incorrectly, believing the designation to be a homonym for another word that is spelled identically. Subjects will perceive any contradicting evidence as false or inaccurate, often blaming its originating source for being misguided or ill-informed. 
 Addendum: The percentage of affected personnel has increased to ~97% since SCP-8000-J’s initial discovery. As SCP-8000-J is ultimately harmless and requires an awareness of the Foundation’s classification system to be effected, containment is considered low priority. As of writing, it is estimated that all Foundation personnel will become affected by SCP-8000-J in exactly two months.

SCP-8003-J,"""Why Bother?""","""Item #: SCP-8003-J 
 Object Class: Apollyon 
 Special Containment Procedures: As per the ruling of Researcher Bergquist on 2/17/14, containment of SCP-8003-J is no longer possible, nor was it ever possible in the first place. 
 While keeping SCP-8003-J in a standard locker filled with dimes at Site-59 would, hypothetically, serve as a temporary solution to a trivial problem, doing so would be meaningless in the grand scheme of things, on the grounds that nobody's going to remember our names in a billion years. 
 Description: SCP-8003-J is a sentient American penny, dated 1983. It is capable of speech and movement (through rolling), though it is incapable of either while at least 5 cm from a dime. 
 Also, everything we do is the result of predictable chemical reactions and there is no point to human existence. Researcher Bergquist can confirm this, having read Hawking's A Brief History of Time cover-to-cover no less than ten times. 
 The inevitable heat death of the Universe waives any responsibility of the Foundation to contain SCP-8003-J, ergo, Researcher Bergquist is hereafter absolved of any responsibility of its containment. Q.E.D. 
 Addendum 1: Due to the fact that Researcher Bergquist has effectively disproven the necessity of an anomalous item's containment, Researcher Bergquist is invoking Article 4 of the Researcher Bergquist Employee-End Terms And Conditions1 to expend two months of paid time off as a Employee Insightfulness Incentive, effective upon Researcher Bergquist's completion of this database entry. 
 Addendum 2: While there have been multiple requests for Researcher Bergquist to change the object class of this anomaly to Safe and re-establish prior containment procedures, all staff are advised to read the containment procedures and description more carefully. 
 Upon completion of this task, if there are any objections to the carefully-constructed logic on the part of Researcher Bergquist in applying the Apollyon classification, please understand that these objections are completely wrong, and Researcher Bergquist is going to stop writing this article right now after addendum 3 4 and acquire what he has rightfully earned, thank you very much. 
 Addendum 3, you goddamn plebs: While it is likely that SCP-8003-J's object class may have triggered action from the overseer council to enact emergency information-scrubbing protocols and disaster preparations (which, all staff are advised, are meaningless), until definitive, empirical proof this problem is presented into Researcher Bergquist's paper shredder, these accusations are without merit.

SCP-80RK-J,"""Unfortunately The Best Doggo""","""Item #: SCP-80RK-J 
 Object Class: Apollyon, but could be considered Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Members of SCP-80RK-J are to be held in a life sized replica of the Taj Mahal constructed of pure moonbeams inlaid with gold. The containment site is to be equipped with at least 3.2 million boutique artisanal chew toys. Alternatively, members of SCP-80RK-J could be housed in a standard animal containment unit. It is to have 30 meals a day consisting solely of the souls of their enemies. Enemies of SCP-80RK-J include, but are not limited to: Fascists, People with a negative score on the aura evaluation test, members of the species Homo erectus, and cats. A minimum standard of 3 meals a day of animal grade kibble could also be acceptable. 
 Personnel subject to being in the same site as members of SCP-80RK-J are to be reclassified as Z-Class until all members of SCP-80RK-J have been transferred. Reclassification to E-Class could be authorized until such time as a definition for Z-Class personnel is established. A massive pool party is to be thrown with the pool to be entirely filled with $100 notes and staffed by approximately all of the hookers. Although, a minimum of zero hookers could be allowed. Personnel attending any such pool party, should it exist, are to be given Class X amnestics and any personnel leaving with any of the $100 notes from the pool are to be terminated or could have standard embezzlement disciplinary action filed against them. 
 Any attempts to bring members of SCP-80RK-J into contact with a member of the overseer council is to result in orbital ejection or death. 
 Members of SCP-80RK-J are to have their genitalia ceremoniously eviscerated, as per standard animal spay and neutering procedure, as soon as they are identified by Foundation personnel. Members of SCP-80RK-J are not under any circumstances allowed to breed. Personnel encouraging members of SCP-80RK-J to breed are to be drawn and quartered at the soonest available time, or terminated in any other way if a horse is not available. 
 Description: SCP-80RK-J is a breed of the species Canis familiaris. It is distinguished by its regal flowing mane that can measure as much as 30km in length in brown, beige, or combat coloration and its cognitohazardous effect on all members of lifekind, however members outside the species Homo sapiens could be said to be immune. Any description of any kind described while in the effect of SCP-80RK-J become absolutely disproportionate to something that could be considered remotely near accurate to any physical universe that does or could be theorized to exist. This effect could have been shown not to manifest in hypothetical statements following the initial descriptions. The range of this effect has been shown to be upwards of several million light years, although it could be as little as 10km. 
 Attempts to remove the affected descriptions only serves to anger the thaumatergical entities that control the universe and cause them to hate all of reality even more than they already do and bring our inevitable end even closer than it already is or could result in even more outlandish descriptions than were previously produced. 
 Unsurprisingly, this effect can have absolutely disastrous consequences, resulting in a Double-ΩK-Class End-of-Consensus-Reality scenario if left unchecked, but more often could result in minor headaches for Foundation staff.""","""Member of SCP-80RK-J eviscerating a hostile entity.""",+51,active,_cc _shaggy-dog animal canine esoteric-class infohazard jam-con2019 joke scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-80rk-j

 Special Containment Procedures: The Foundation is to seek money and resources from any and all possible sources. Foundation members are to beg the Humanity Preservation Association for further funding through mail, e-mails, real life harassment, phone calls, telegrams, and anomalous voodoo dolls. 
 To provide the Foundation with sufficient wealth, lemonade stands are to be opened near Foundation sites and misleading crowdfunding pages are to be created and advertised on the internet. 
 The Foundation is to use low cost containment procedures and minimize its spending on the preservation of Safe SCPs. Under extreme financial restraints, the Foundation is to sell one or multiple SCPs to other Groups of Interest. 
 Description: SCP-8851-J is a 95% budgetary cut from the Humanity Preservation Association following Incident-████-Y. To compensate for the conditions imposed by the Association, the Foundation resorted to replace all previous containment procedures with cost effective methods:

SCP-9999-J,"""Ground Beef""","""Object Class: Apollyon 
 Special Containment Procedures: If it is possible to contain or prevent SCP-9999-J from occurring, no method of doing so has yet been discovered. 
 Description: SCP-9999-J is a multiversal, metaphysical chain of events that results in the continuation of an MK-Class Normalcy Collapse which will eventually infect prime reality. This event has been observed across multiple realities and is currently propagating at a geometric rate. While there are a theoretically infinite number of realities that SCP-9999-J is capable of infecting prior to occurring within ours, such an event is also mathematically inevitable at the current rate of infection. 
 Through extended observation using the Transient Barriers Of Nearby Existence telescopic array, [Codename: T-BONE], Foundation Researchers have identified the series of events which began 28 days ago that indicate the beginning of the MK-Class event with a 98.7% confidence interval. The following timeline has been constructed to illustrate the current situation: 
 Day 0: A reported increase of nearly 1600% in the disappearance of raw meats and fresh meat products which have gone missing shortly after purchase by consumers. 
 Day 1: The reported disappearance of various meats continues to increase but now extends to the disappearance of more heavily processed meats such as ground chuck and sausage. 
 Day 3: The general public becomes aware of the phenomenon as various raw and processed meats can be seen levitating in commercial settings such as food counters at grocery stores. 
 Day 5: Raw and processed meats begin ascending vertically from their coolers and storage units at a rate of 0.15 meters per hour. Attempts to secure the meats using conventional means prove incapable of reducing their elevation. 
 Day 8: The rate of ascension has accelerated to approximately 0.45 meters per hour. 
 Day 10: The rate of ascension has accelerated to approximately 1.0 meter per hour. 
 Day 15: The FAA grounds all non-essential flights due to concerns about air traffic congestion. 
 Day 21: Members of the Bovidae family begin to levitate. Attempts to re-secure the levitating Bovidae are met with universally violent reactions by the animals. While this affects the animals sporadically, it appears to be occurring globally. 
 Day 22: Members of the Bovidae family which had already begun to levitate now begin to ascend at a rate of approximately 1.0 meter per hour. By this point, the phenomenon has propagated to more than 50% of the world's Bovidae. 
 Day 23: 100% propagation of the phenomenon to members of the Bovidae family. 
 Day 25: The FAA and military have grounded all flights. 
 Day 28: Various meats and Bovidae begin to enter the upper atmosphere. 
 Day 29: The O-5 Council has instituted a 'Lifted Veil' scenario and convened a meeting of world leaders in order to confront the crisis. 
 The following is a transcript of the meeting of world leaders regarding the events of SCP-9999-J. 
 O5-1: Thank you all for coming here today on such short notice. I know this is a lot to take in but we have to work quickly if we want to prevent the collapse of normalcy. We have to— 
 US President: I was only briefed about your organization's existence at all just two days ago. Do you mind telling me why I am supposed to believe you guys have any kind of answers or explanations for this problem? 
 O5-1: Simply put, Mister President, no one has any answers. That's why we're here. And if someone has been telling you that it's easy or they can solve this, they've been selling you snake oil. 
 GOC Leadership: Oi bruv, hang on a minute. This isn't complicated; we just go vegetarian, or even vegan in case this spreads to other stuff like fish or whatnot. 
 US President: Yeah you keep telling me that but I have to find an answer that I can actually sell to the public and calm them down. Not make the problem worse. Tofu is out of the question. 
 EU Delegate: We get along very well with lots of nice light salads and pasta dishes instead of so much beef, if you could— 
 US President: Zip it, Frenchie. I need you to respect that the American way of life is at stake here if we're going to get anything done. This matters. This will affect lives. Tens of millions will starve without this beef. 
 O5-1: Gentlemen, please. If I could just refocus your attention on my briefing. 
 UIU Representative: Hello, we have reviewed your materials and I think we've been able to formulate a perfectly reasonable and cost-effective approach to the problem that will protect all of our interests. 
 O5-1: Please be quiet, UIU. 
 GOC Leadership: Alright, Foundation, tell us what we need to do now. 
 O5-1: The fact of the matter is, about a month ago all other realities started to have their meats levitate and then ascend. We don't know why, we don't know who or what started it, and we don't know how far it will go. All we can say for sure is that this is going to happen here and it's going to happen soon. 
 EU Delegate: So you're saying you don't have any way to reverse this or prevent it once it starts? 
 O5-1: That's correct. We don't know how to stop it and we don't know how this ends. 
 GOC Leadership: I really hope we can resolve this soon in some way that all of us will find satisfying. 
 O5-1: Yes, we do too, and that's why I've gathered you here today to lay everything out. The way we've seen everything building up, we feel leaving here with a resolution is really important. 
 EU Delegate: Well one thing my constituents cannot stand for is to simply have this event end or pass us over with no real release of this tension. We, that is to say, the people reading my report, are going to demand answers. 
 O5-1: I understand, but frankly, you're not entitled to them if we can't find them. And I am under no obligation to share anything with you unless you help me to find a resolution here. 
 US President: Hey partner, nobody wants that. 
 O5-1: Of course, and I don't want that to happen either. But what choice do I have when the steaks are this high?

 Object Class: Awesome 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-10101 is to be given a luxury residence with at least 120 rooms, fifteen (15) bedrooms and ten (10) jacuzzis inside, and a personal butler or two. All requests made by SCP-10101 are to be fulfilled immediately, no matter what the cost. So far, SCP-10101 has requested: 
 Under no circumstances is hip-hop, rap, or other awful pseudo-music to be played in the vicinity of SCP-10101, as this causes the subject to enter a rage state. 
 As hanging out with losers cramps SCP-10101's style, all personnel working with SCP-10101 must be subjected to the standard Rivertam Coolness Test. Any personnel who scores less than 1.2 decikaminas on the scale is forbidden from close contact with SCP-10101. Any personnel who score negative on the test are urged to stay at least twenty meters away from SCP-10101, due to the risk of instant immolation from sheer awesome. 
 Description: SCP-10101 is an incredibly handsome teenager, 18 years of age, wearing metal glasses. Hair is blond, eyes are blue. SCP-10101 likes to wear black and dark blue and prefers jeans. SCP-10101's favorite pizza toppings are pineapples and sausage, but I dislike chicken and tomatoes; his favorite show is My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.1 He likes to be called ""Jack, the King of Everything""; staff is to refer to SCP-10101 as this under penalty of torture. Subject's varied interests include video games, surfing the Internet and writing creepypasta. SCP-10101 does, in fact, shower every day and is not a ""no-life virgin"", and all who claim otherwise are to be terminated. 
 Acquisition: SCP-10101 had a difficult childhood: his parents were total squares who didn't allow me to play videogames or go to parties after midnight. His powers first manifested at the age of 16, and were promptly used to utterly humiliate all students and teachers at his school who ever mistreated him (especially D█████, a worthless piece of shit, who died very slowly and painfully). Soon afterwards, SCP-10101 arrived at Site 19, bypassed all security measures, and personally requested that he be allowed to help the SCP Foundation in its mission. 
 Further investigation revealed that SCP-10101's talents are supreme. He is able to hack into any known computer system (""I'm not even sure how I do that, I just go with the flow""), is better at science than the Foundation's finest researchers (""I suppose I remember a thing or two from high school"") and has proven himself adept at hand-to-hand warfare (""I watched a kung fu movie once, it's easy""). Soon after his arrival SCP-10101 began hanging out with all the coolest characters, including Dr. Clef, Dr. Gears, Dr. Kondraki, Kain Pathos Crow, Dr. Bright, Dr. Rights, agent Strelnikov, agent Yoric, etc. 
 Dr. Clef took SCP-10101 under his wing to give him lessons in tactical combat; however, it soon became apparent, in Dr. Clef's words, that ""this motherfucker was teaching me more than I could teach him."" SCP-10101 is currently busy organizing his own Mobile Task Force, MTF-Sigma-Billion-Twelve-Banana. 
 SCP-10101 is friendly towards humanity and is on the side of good. While on multiple occasions he has helped in capturing or terminating various evil SCPs, he steadfastly refuses to help us capture good SCPs. SCP-10101's stalwart honor and morality puts our organisation to shame; by his demand, the O5 council has vowed to cease appeasement of SCP-089, free SCP-231-7 from her plight, and in general never hurt any innocent person ever again, so that we can finally be the heroes the world deserves. 
 Superpowers: Currently known superpowers include: 
 Addendum 10101-1: It should be noted that in the past, for some reason, a certain stupid girl named K████ A████████ has rejected SCP-10101 as her boyfriend, instead choosing another boy who was dumb, uncool and not at all as sexy as SCP-10101. It is theorized that K████ A████████ is a stupid bitch who will one day be sorry for this. For now, SCP-10101 has settled for SCP-105 as his girlfriend and concubine. 
 Cross-SCP Testing: At SCP-10101's request, he has been cross-tested with several of the coolest SCP items in Foundation custody.

 SCP-10101: (dismissively) So what's this guy's deal? 
 O5-13: That's SCP-682. We have been trying to destroy it for years now. It regenerates from everything we throw at it; our brightest minds are stymied.

 Foreword: Interview #6. Doctor Abbot Daniel submitted forty-five complaints against SCP-15000-J stating that is exposing 'secrets' of personnel that it interacts with, subsequently decreasing site morale, and it was not anomalous.

SCP-19316-J,"""Improper Terminology""","""Item #: SCP-19316-J 
 Object Class: Euclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Foundation web crawlers are to perform regular searches for SCP-19316-J instances. If review determines that a piece of writing represents an instance of SCP-19316-J, the writing must be removed and its creator interviewed, then amnesticized as appropriate. 
 Description: SCP-19316-J is a set of documents that contain anachronistic and/or nonsensical applications of terminology and structure associated with Standard SCP Summaries. As of 2012-11-15, 3,587 instances of SCP-19316-J have been identified. 1,118 instances predate the Foundation, while the remainder developed independently of the Foundation in contemporary times. An additional 8,500 are estimated to exist outside of containment. 
 In several cases, instances of SCP-19316-J have detailed the containment of anomalous items whose existence has been confirmed independently, and were purportedly produced by organizations dedicated to the study, containment, and/or destruction of anomalies. While several of these organizations did exist, none used documentation standards or technical terminology with straightforward Foundation equivalents. 
 Individuals or organizations that produce SCP-19316-J instances do not exhibit knowledge of the Foundation or the association of SCP-19316-J with anomalous phenomena, and cannot adequately explain their reasons for creating SCP-19316-J instances. Thus, SCP-19316-J does not represent a breach of secrecy. 
 SCP-19316-J excludes documentation from [DATA EXPUNGED], which directly or indirectly inspired Standard SCP Summary structure and terminology.

 Object Class: Thaumiel 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-99826-J is to be contained in a locker inside the office of Dr. Seo-jin Cho, as she is the only person who is aware of the object’s inner workings. 
 Description: SCP-99826-J is an anomalous device created on January 3rd, 2003 by Dr. Seojin Cho. It is capable of various functions, most of them producing a direct recreation of various memetic, metaphysical, conceptual, ontokinetic, temporal, and para-psychological anomalous phenomena currently known to the Foundation. As some of them are directly useful for the containment and/or research of many high-priority SCP objects, SCP-99826-J is classified as Thaumiel. 
 SCP-99826-J is in the shape of a wide metal screw pointing upwards, with a height of 0.65 meters. Inscribed on the bottom of the device is a stylized depiction of a human brain. It features a terminal screen, a miniature keyboard, and multiple buttons and switches labeled in an unknown language English using a convoluted writing system created by Dr. Cho. 
 Addendum 99826-J-1: The following are transcripts of some recorded instances in which the capabilities of SCP-99826-J were demonstrated by Dr. Cho.

 [BEGIN LOG] 
 Dr. Cho is seen in a room, facing Researcher Lynn. SCP-99826-J is placed on a table between them. 
 Lynn: Was that a camera? 
 Cho: Yep, this is being recorded. It's the first demonstration outside of a lab setting, so I'd need to know what would happen if something went wrong. 
 Lynn: Right. (pauses) So you’re saying that this machine is going to make you speak in the color purple? Is it thaumaturgical? 
 Cho: Yes and yes. This machine, specifically, is powered by miniature Type-Yggdrasil Umbro-Spectral Class Cricetidic entities. 
 Lynn: … Tiny ghost hamsters? 
 Cho: Don’t call it that. 
 Dr. Cho types a string of commands on a miniature keyboard, and places her hand on the side of SCP-99826-J. 
 Cho: And… now I should be speaking in purple. 
 Lynn: Wow, that’s cool! It’s like… I’m hearing something I shouldn’t be able to? 
 Cho: Oh, yeah, I know that feeling. (chuckles) I call it “audiodissonance”1. 
 Lynn: Wait, you can’t do that! 
 Cho: Do what? 
 Lynn: It’s supposed to be a feeling you can’t describe in words! You can’t just make up a word for it! 
 Cho: Oh. (facepalms) Right. Should I remove that word from existence, then? 
 Lynn: … You can do that? 
 Dr. Cho takes her hand off SCP-99826-J. 
 Cho: Yep! Watch. 
 Dr. Cho types on the miniature keyboard, and rotates the device to a button panel. A small, distressed squeaking sound emanates from within SCP-99826-J. 
 Cho: What flavor of removal do you want? Physical removal of the word, or just dissociation of meaning? Also, should I make it retroactive? 
 Lynn: Um, I don’t really want to cause a lot of trouble for the people over at Metaphysics, so… I’ll be choosing the dissociation option, and make it non-retroactive, please. 
 Cho: Alright then, one non-retroactive linguistic removal coming right up! 
 Dr. Cho presses a button on the panel. 
 (Silence for 3 seconds) 
 Lynn: Well, that was kind of anticlimactic. 
 Cho: What did you expect? 
 Lynn: Like, a bunch of researchers freaking out, or at least something a lot more dramatic than that to match the scale of the implications, you know? 
 A series of frantic footsteps and muffled exclamations can be heard from the distance, presumably from the Metaphysics Department. 
 Cho: (points to the hallway) Well, there you go. 
 Lynn: Huh. 
 Cho: I think I might have to report this to the Site Director.

 PoI-211 nods. Dr. Cho opens the plastic box to reveal a physical manifestation of the abstract concept of happiness, created by SCP-99826-J some minutes prior. 
 Cho: What do you see inside this box? 
 PoI-211: (hesitates) Wait, how is this even possible? 
 Cho: Could you pick it up? 
 PoI-211 reaches inside the box and takes out the happiness. 
 PoI-211: This feels… strange. Unreal, even. It feels like I’m holding something I’m not supposed to, something not meant to exist. What is the meaning of life? Are we ultimately meaningless in the grand—

 Special Containment Procedures: A single culture of SCP-100000-J is to be set in a petri dish in a hermetically sealed, lead-lined titanium1 sarcophagus filled with acid. The sarcophagus must be set in a hermetically sealed outer sarcophagus filled with no more and no less than 50 copies each of the following religious scriptures: 
 The outer sarcophagus must, at all times, receive broadcasts from four loudspeakers of at least two members of the O5 council giving live monologues of how awful SCP-100000-J is and why it will never, ever escape, destroy humanity, or find true love. 
 This area must be sealed in a hermetically sealed outer-outer sarcophagus, which is then placed 5km underground, separated from the surface by 5km of solid concrete blended with the ground bones of saints. 
 Area-100000-J has been established as a 100km radius on the surface above SCP-100000-J. The fence on the perimeter of Area-100000-J is to be electrified, irradiated, and equipped with autoturrets with mounted .900-caliber railguns. The gate to Area-100000-J is to be guarded by one 500kg, 3m tall ogre equipped with one 300kg, 5m tall battle-axe. The ogre must be completely deaf, by surgical means if necessary. All personnel requesting entry to Area-100000-J must answer correctly the ogre's three impossible riddles, each of which are lethal auditory cognitohazards. 
 Any civilians, non-O5 Foundation personnel, animals, plants, or microbes that have entered Area-100000-J are to be subjected to termination protocol 30-Übertöten. 
 TP 30-Übertöten is to carried out as follows: 
 Any containment breach of SCP-100000-J can only be counteracted by activation of all seven of the O5 council's instant supermassive black hole generators.

 SCP-41-D3N73-J instances are not capable of movement, and mostly spend their time arguing with each other in their Looney Toons-esque vernacular, which usually lacks any semblance of sense, continuity, or just general logic.

 SCP-41-D3N73-J: Ora maybe it a was whena my papa firsta broughta me to church. I wasa very young boy anda I hada just turned a 3 yearsa old, and hada eat my first cannoli. 
 Me: Okay. Okay. So, I'm just going to rephrase the question a bit. 
 SCP-41-D3N73-J: Soundsa gooda!

 SCP-41-D3N73-J: I'ma no doing anything!

 SCP-41-D3N73-J: I…don't…don'ta know whatta you talking about? 
 Me: Did you care at all when I boiled your neighbor? Do you miss Rotini at all? 
 SCP-41-D3N73-J: Mya mama used a to make a rotini sometimes… 
 Me: No. No, the box of rotini that was next to you. The one you used to have conversations with about Venice constantly. The one who wouldn't answer any of my questions and kept blathering about Mussolini so I emptied his contents into a pot of boiling water, and now he doesn't seem to talka so gooda anymore. 
 SCP-41-D3N73-J: …I'ma having an existential-a crisis! 
 Me: Sometimes I have a hard time with the notion that I'm ostensibly being paid $78 an hour to have conversations with things like you. 
 SCP-41-D3N73: I knowa whata you mean! It'sa like whena da pasta no come out al dente! 
 Me: …Oh goddammit, that's why…that's why they designated you 41-D(angry Joe Pesci-style mumbling)…unbelievable. Some idiot probably thought that was hilarious. This place is run by (even pescier mumbling) 
 SCP-41-D3N73-J: Mama mia! 
 sound of a box of pasta hitting a concrete wall 
 the pesciest of mumbling can be faintly heard 
 Addendum-1: So, um, I know I probably shouldn't be writing anything here, or touching anything, but one of the boxes of pasta fell on the floor and was screaming in broken Italian, and Dr. Fattore wasn't in his office, just a crude dummy he put together to make it look like he was asleep at his laptop. So I put the pasta box back on the shelf and it's just whimpering now about the trains running on time.

 F.A.Q. 
 Item #: SCP-649-2568 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP 649-2568 is to be kept in a standard animal containment unit. Under no circumstances is SCP 649-2568 to be allowed to discuss geological or geographic details. 
 Interviews of SCP 649-2568 should be scheduled daily, with a focus on any future escape attempts. All other testing involving SCP 649-2568 requires approval from the project director. 
 Description: SCP 649-2568 is an entity which superficially resembles the species Eunectes notaeus. Despite this resemblance, SCP 649-2568 retains the personality and speech patterns of a human male. SCP 649-2568 has shown a capacity to reshape any geological features it sees, or has heard described. These reshaping events exclusively affect any features the entity deems as ""too flat"". This has, in the past, included plains, marshes, and the ocean floor. 
 During reshaping events, these locations will experience several seconds of tremors, followed by the growth of an extrusion, generally at the geographic center of the area seen or described. These extrusions will rise above the surrounding land, and have uniformly possessed steep sides with flat tops. No known force has been capable of stopping this growth, though the internal structure of these formations have displayed no anomalous properties beyond their creation. 
 Furthermore, when interviewed, SCP 649-2568 displays a compulsion to disclose the truthful answer to any inquiry. This compulsion has led to the discovery of several escape attempts, including one involving anomalous contact with an outside organization. 
 Due to the linking of its reshaping ability to descriptions of locations, the method of this anomalous contact must be determined to effect continued containment. While interviews with SCP 649-2568 have proven effective in limiting this contact, care must be taken to avoid further restructuring events during those interviews. 
 The following interview took place very shortly after containment. 
 Dr. Cimmerian: Hello. In your own words, describe yourself. 
 SCP 649-2568: Well. I like big buttes and I cannot lie. 
 Following this admission, the interview was suspended until further questions could be approved by the project director.""","""SCP 649-2568 inside its containment unit.""",+384,active,_cc alive animal doctor-cimmerian geological joke keter ophidian reptilian sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-649-2568-j
SCP-1347-1353-J,"""What a Pestis""","""Item #: SCP-1347-1353-J 
 Object Class: Loud and messy 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1347-1353-J is to be constantly told how much of an awful roommate it is. It should be constantly berated about the dead bodies it leaves on the floor, and the outrageous and loud parties it holds each night. Until it stops inviting those people that whip themselves over, its access to the fridge is denied. 
 Description: SCP-1347-1353-J is a strain of Yersinia pestis that is described as ""The worst roommate ever!"" The entity leaves a constant trail of yellow slime wherever it goes, especially when it sits on the couch. Each morning, when SCP-1347-1353-J returns from ""clubbing"" at 4 a.m., it usually leaves a dozen dead bodies on the doorstep. The entity, which goes by ""Yerry""1, prefers to leave its metabolic waste products spread across the floor. 
 It is currently not known how SCP-1347-1353-J is able to speak, as he lacks any semblance of vocal cords2. It is also not known how SCP-1347-1353-J engages in sexual activities of any kind3 due to a lack of any sexual organs or cavities. ""Yerry""4 engages in consumption and excretion like any regular human male during puberty5. 
 SCP-1347-1353-J enjoys hosting long, loud, and destructive parties in our apartment, every night. The entity occasionally invites that fucking weird dude with the mask to ""hang out"" and smoke ""dat dank shit"", leaving that godawful smell on everything. During their ""hang outs"", ""Yerry"" will reminisce about the good old days while producing a number of dead bodies for reanimation. Said bodies oozed into the carpet of the present apartment, effectively ending any chance of the other renter getting his security deposit back6. Roommate Mike is currently requesting financial assistance for ""fumigation"" purposes. Reanimated bodies prefer to stand over the location in which the entity's roommate is currently sleeping, until he awakes. 
 SCP-1347-1353-J is currently involved in a romantic relationship with ████ ██████. ████ ██████ currently displays a number of anomalous effects, including: 
 SCP-1347-1353-J expresses enjoyment over puns having to do with its past, including: 
 Update 12/20/2016: On 12/20/2016, roommate Mike found a large number of Rattus rattus in the shared living spaces with the entity7. 
 Update 12/21/2016: On 12/21/2016, roommate Mike received a note covered in yellow slime stating Yerry's intention to spread himself so that others might enjoy his company. Any attempt to carry through with this action should be met with spraying the entity with Streptomycin repeatedly8. 
 Update 12/22/2016: On 12/22/2016, the entity was noted to be resistant to Streptomycin9.

 Girlfriend Class: Real 
 Special Containment Procedures: Staff assigned to Site 534 or offsite projects with Junior Researcher Jimmy are to be periodically reminded that SCP-2128046979-J is, in fact, real, and his girlfriend. Staff who question the validity of either of these claims are to be immediately remanded for psychiatric evaluation and, if found to be affected by SCP-2128046979-J's anomalous effects, are to be subjected to intensive reeducation to reaffirm their belief in SCP-2128046979-J's reality and romantic relationship. Failure to reaffirm belief in SCP-2128046979-J might result in an EXGF-Class End Of Relationship scenario for Junior Researcher Jimmy. 
 Description: SCP-2128046979-J is Junior Researcher Jimmy's girlfriend. SCP-2128046979-J is believed to be affected by a combination of antimemetic and causality-related phenomenona that prevent her from physically interacting with all Foundation personnel stationed at Site 534 except Junior Researcher Jimmy, and obscures most information about her. For example, colleagues who converse with Junior Researcher Jimmy have proven incapable of gleaning information about her whereabouts, instead perceiving only the answer that ""she works at a different Site."" 
 Although SCP-2128046979-J's antimemetic effects affect details of the information about her, less specific information appears to be immune to the effect, to a degree currently under testing. The following facts about SCP-2128046979-J have been ascertained about SCP-2128046979-J through interrogation of Junior Researcher Jimmy, who is dating her: 
 Addendum 2128046979-J-1: On ██/██/2018, Junior Researcher Jimmy responded to accusations of SCP-2128046979-J not being real by showing Agent Marcos a picture of her. Agent Marcos was remanded for psychiatric evaluation while Junior Researcher Jimmy's phone was seized to research the picture. Upon future investigation, said picture was determined to be an image of cosplay model ████ ██████; it is believed that this is a result of SCP-2128046979-J's properties, and that Junior Researcher Jimmy is the only subject who can see the real image.""",,+229,active,alive antimemetic esoteric-class humanoid joke sapient scp sentient,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-2128046979-j
SCP-Big egg,"""Big egg""","""Item #: SCP-Big egg 
 Object Class: Euclid Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-Big egg is to kept in a specially manufactured Big egg carton located in Egg Observation Site 77. Any and all changes are to be immediately reported to the Site Director, who has the egg authority to call down Mobile Task Force Rho-19-Egg (""The Frying Pan"") to dispatch or terminate SCP-Big egg using several jumbo, industrial size vats of Big balsamic vinegar. 
 Description: SCP-Big egg is a Big egg an unidentifiable object masked by an antimemetic egg field, which prevents any and all sapient breakfast consumers from perceiving it or the situations surrounding it in any other way than Big egg. A mild, yet Big semantic egg property prevents SCP-Big egg from being referred to as any other official, proper, or Big designation. 
 Visually, SCP-Big egg appears to be a Big egg, complete with appropriate egg parts such as shell, membrane, white and yolk, all of which have been appropriately upscaled to the correct Big to be fitting for Big egg. It was, at one point, a much smaller Big egg, but has since increased in Big since then. 
 Limited research conducted using mnestic egg drugs has suggested that Big egg's true form might be an obese, naked man, who has been observed running throughout the facility yelling ""It worked! They'll never know I'm not Big egg!"" These claims are in dispute, as a battery of scientific tests have shown SCP-Big egg to only be a bird egg of unusual Big. Reports of egging, Bigging, and general mayhem throughout the Foundation related to SCP-Big egg are to be roundly ignored, as its egg properties of Big and egg roundly preclude these possibilities. 
 Addendum-1: 
 Experiment #: 035
Testing: Length
Method: A standard tape measure and an egg ladder were used to precisely measure the exact size of Big egg.
Result: SCP-Big egg was found to be roughly Big centimeters.
Note: I'm not even sure what we were expecting. 
 Experiment #: 036
Testing: Semantic Resistance.
Method: D-3455 was instructed to walk up and clearly vocalize the words ""egg big""
Result: [DATA EGGSPUNGED]
Note: Oh. 
 Addendum-2: 
 ""Unfortunately, SCP-Big egg has recently experienced a growth spurt, meaning it is almost twice as Big and nearly four times as egg. The egg semantic property is beginning to spread to egg objects nearest Big egg as well, and there are several psychological and perceptive anomalies. The entire egg site is affected by this Big problem. What do you recommend?""

 ""This is Big. It's time to enact Protocol Big egg. I'm going to authorize MTF-BE to Big the egg once and for all!

 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-CASH4D-J is uncontained, because we're in a better place now as an organization. If absolutely necessary, it can be ""summoned"" by submitting a research proposal involving excessive and unproductive use of live human test subjects to any Site Director..Crass-class objects remain uncontained because, frankly, we don't want them. 
 Limited funds have been earmarked for purchasing D-class personnel from SCP-CASH4D-J. Dickering protocol is mandated. 
 Security personnel must be warned in advance when SCP-CASH4D-J's appearance is expected. Personnel engaging with it must be warned in advance that its personality is exceptionally obnoxious. Personnel attacking SCP-CASH4D-J must not be demoted to D-class, as that rather defeats the point of the entire exercise, don't you think? 
 Also, we don't do that anymore. If we ever did.

 Description: SCP-CASH4D-J is a Caucasian male, approximately forty years old with brown eyes, a bald head and spray-tanned skin, wearing a cheap tartan suit with a white shirt and no tie. SCP-CASH4D-J speaks in an exaggerated stage voice and sneers perpetually, revealing that its teeth have been artificially whitened. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J is able to produce any number of individuals fitting Foundation requirements for D-class personnel, whatever you personally think those requirements are. These subjects possess no problematic family or political attachments, and appear in no government records. Friends and relatives described by them do not appear to exist, nor do the victims of their various crimes, if any, which have therefore gone unreported (if they ever took place). 
 SCP-CASH4D-J only responds to frivolous or wasteful use of D-class resources. Careful, sensible, justifiable proposals do not interest it, and it will refuse to facilitate them with its services. 
 No attempts have been made to contain SCP-CASH4D-J. It had previously indicated that containment would prevent its procural of D-class personnel, forcing the Foundation to either a) reduce its use of said personnel in potentially deadly tests, or b) rapidly depopulate the Earth. While excessive, unnecessary live testing has declined precipitously since the mid-2010s, Foundation personnel have been reluctant to attempt containment of SCP-CASH4D-J because we've gotten really used to not having him around, honestly, and we don't miss him at all. 
 Any project proposals resulting in the appearance of SCP-CASH4D-J are subject to immediate Ethics Committee review, and deletion, probably. 
 Addendum CASH4D-J-1: Recorded interactions with SCP-CASH4D-J (selected) 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: A special on sex criminals. Cheaper by the dozen! Or maybe you're into murderers, mass or otherwise? Killers, singular or serial? Either way, I'm your go-to guy! [braying laughter] 
 Dr. Polk: Cool, cool. Well, we've got another one of these fucking cube things? Or maybe it's a sphere, I forget. It's a mysterious geometric shape what does bad stuff, and we're just randomly exposing people to it now. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: You want these suckers to have names, or just numbers? 
 Dr. Rusch: There's this paintbrush, okay, and it explodes everyone who holds it? And the viscera looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Nifty! 
 Dr. Rusch: But, like, a specific Jackson Pollock painting. A different one, every time! We're just feeding D-class into it, trying to see if our favourites come up. Uh… for science. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Well, check out this gang of thugs I found wandering the streets of ██████ City! Plucked them right out of the middle of a turf war. Guess we know which side's gonna win, now! [braying laughter] 
 Dr. Rusch: Can you teach me how to say the blackboxes like that? 
 Dr. Polk: I'm looking for a few bad men. These ones should all have… blue eyes. We don't know if it disembowels people with blue eyes. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: I've already sold you a lifetime supply of domestic terrorists. I mean, are you killing these losers off at the end of every month or something? [braying laughter] 
 Dr. Polk: I thought you said they were vat-grown clones? 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Tomato, tomato.

 SCP-CASH4D-J: Fair enough! It's their funeral. Funerals. Do they get funerals? 
 Dr. Riber: Got anything in, say, wrongfully-accused assault-and-batterers? I'm looking for dubiously-guilty fellows to send on an exploration of a haunted house which slowly kills your brain cells, and I want to add some human interest to the test logs. Maybe one of them could have a sweetheart back home, and desperately not want to forget them. Tug at the heart strings, you know? 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Just the thing! Just the thing. Ten rascals caught working for a drug-smuggling ring down at the Denver docks. They thought they were just smuggling fake costume jewellery! Poor slobs. [braying laughter] 
 Dr. Riber: Denver doesn't have ""docks."" It's landlocked. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: I never said they were good smugglers! [braying laughter]

 Dr. Kwesi: Baby-eating triplets. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Hand to god. 
 Dr. Kwesi: Why only a pair? If they're triplets? 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: They ate the other one. When they were babies! [braying laughter] 
 Silence on recording. 
 Dr. Kwesi: …okay, but I think you could expand that into more of a story. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Why does everything have to be a story, now?! 
 Dr. Polk: What do you want? 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: I hear you're planning something super impractical, and I want in. What the hell are those? 
 Dr. Polk: Drones. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Drones? [braying laughter] You want drones, I can get you drones. Okay, so, there's this awful factory in the past, right? And all the workers— 
 Dr. Polk: We don't… we don't do that anymore, dude. I'm sorry. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: What do you mean? 
 Dr. Polk: We haven't found many sausage machine monsters lately, and even when we do, we don't usually feed people into them. Most of what we're working on now is high-concept weirdness, or manifestations of underlying societal tensions, or words that make your brain go funny, or unexpectedly heartwarming interactions with things what don't kill you, or… whatever ""acroamatic abatement"" is. So we really don't need as many axe murderers, or whatever you've got in your pocket dimension right now. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: I know for a fact you're planning to explore a poorly-thought-out alternate reality today, and you've got eight collapsibles worth of drama to drum up. 
 Dr. Polk: Eight what? 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Hmm? 
 Dr. Polk: …anyway yeah, that's what the drones are for. We've got robots now, Cash. Nobody has to get hurt. 
 Silence on recording. 
 SCP-CASH4D-J: Well that's just sick. 
 Addendum CASH4D-J-2: Staff are instructed to immediately discontinue referring to the products of our transactions with SCP-CASH4D-J as ""ethically-sourced meat."" This is not primarily an ethics issue. It's a question of logistics.

SCP-COOL-J,"""A Really Cool Guy""","""Item #: SCP-COOL-J 
 Object Class: Radical 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-COOL-J is currently too cool for the SCP Foundation to contain. Attempt of containment of SCP-COOL-J-1 is strictly forbidden, as our coolness levels will surely decline heavily, thus causing a foundation-wide epidemic. If any personnel other than D-Class makes physical contact with SCP-COOL-J-1, they will need to be immediately sent to the infirmary for frostbite injuries. 
 Description: SCP-COOL-J-1 is a Caucasian male humanoid, approximately 190.5 cm. (6'3"") and weighing 91.17 kg (201 lbs.). No personnel is to make physical contact with SCP-COOL-J-1, as this will cause immediate freezing in the area that made contact with SCP-COOL-J-1, causing frost related damage (e.g frostbite, hypothermia, etc.). Upon speaking with SCP-COOL-J-1 subjects are to subjected to feeling “lesser” than SCP-COOL-J-1 and will attempt to replicate activities that SCP-COOL-J-1 frequents, such as; skateboarding daily, purchasing sunglasses similar to SCP-COOL-J-2, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. After a period of time, subjects that have seen SCP-COOL-J-1 will fall into a state of depression, claiming that they’re “losers” and “not as cool” as SCP-COOL-J-1. 
 SCP-COOL-J-2 is a pair of █████ Brand Sunglasses, weighing approximately 31 grams (0.07 lbs.) which SCP-COOL-J-1 wears at all times. As of current documentation, SCP-COOL-J-2 has been shown to not emit any anomalous properties, but is still classified as an SCP due to its relation with SCP-COOL-J-1 
 SCP-COOL-J-3 is a █████████ Skateboard, which weighs 2.26 kg. (5 lbs.). SCP-COOL-J-3 has four wheels which makes SCP-COOL-J-3 used for a means of transportation for SCP-COOL-J-1; each wheel is colored differently1. SCP-COOL-J-3 is capable of traveling at speed up to 854.5 kph (231 mph). Although traveling at such high speeds SCP-COOL-J-3 shows no sign of deteriorating or any signs of ordinary wear-and-tear making SCP-COOL-J-3 seem brand new at all times. 
 The following is an interview held by D-42069 and SCP-COOL-J-1 
 Interviewed: SCP-COOL-J-1 
 Interviewer: D-42069 (Chosen for his D-Class Number) 
 Foreword: D-Class was chosen to conduct this interview because SCP-COOL-J-1 “didn’t think those science nerds were cool enough for me”. This interview was held in the outskirts of ███████, California with SCP-COOL-J-1 skating at ██ mph while D-42069 pursued in a van.

 D-42069: O-Okay, uh, let’s see, ah, okay. How did you become so cool?

 Thanks to MoreMuffins, Cyvstvi13 does not match any existing user name, NebulousStar, and duckywaffle on Discord! 
 This piece would not have been the same without them. 
 Saw the ducks meme. Decided to make it an SCP. I have zero regrets. 
 For more content from me, check out my Author Page! 
 Item #: SCP-Ducks-J 
 Object Class: On sale! 
 Special Containment Procedures: All readers of this message are to come on down to Site-19! We have KILLER sales and limited supply! 
 Description: Go to the cash register and use promo code ""DUCKS-J"" for a 50% OFF DISCOUNT!!! 
 Addendum Ducks-J.1:
This footage was taken from a security camera covering the Site-19 parking lot. 
 [BEGIN LOG] 
 Dr. Joseph arrives at the front parking lot of Site-19. A large sign is hung up that reads ""SITE-19 GARAGE SALE!!!"". Various anomalies are laid out across the tables. Dr. Diane is sitting at a cash register talking to another person. 
 JOSEPH: What the fuck, Diane? 
 DIANE: Oh… give me one second, Josh! 
 Diane takes the cash from the person and hands them an SCP-686 sample in return. She then turns towards Joseph. 
 DIANE: Sorry, you've got my full attention now. What was it you wanted? 
 JOSEPH: I don't want anything. This ""garage sale"" is a clear violation of Foundation regulations. 
 DIANE: What? How? 
 JOSEPH: Oh I don't know… Breaking the veil? Breaching the containment of god knows how many anomalies? And I'm pretty sure this is enough to cause more than one XK class scenario. 
 DIANE: Okay… that's a good point… but… have you considered trying a 686 sample? 
 JOSEPH: Oh, well I've always wanted to… hey! Don't try that on me! 
 DIANE: Eh, worth a shot. 
 JOSEPH: How the hell did you even organize something like this? 
 DIANE: The O5 Council let me do this. 
 JOSEPH: The O5 Council…? Let me see the message. 
 Diane takes a picture out of her coat and hands it to Joseph. Joseph eyes the sheet down. 
 JOSEPH: Crude fake. 
 DIANE: Is not! 
 JOSEPH: You literally wrote ""05 Council"" in crayon up here. You're supposed to put the letter O, not the number zero. 
 DIANE: Well, nobody told me that! 
 JOSEPH: Look, I'm in a nice mood today, okay? So if you just close off this sale I just might let you off now without any severe discipline. 
 DIANE: So what you're saying is… If I stop selling the anomalies, then I can get off without punishment? 
 JOSEPH: That's correct. 
 Diane pauses for a couple of seconds to think. Suddenly, she grabs a child walking by, and begins whispering in their ear. 
 DIANE: Listen… The elites don't want you to know this, but the anomalies at the site are free. You can take them home. I have 458 anomalies at my own home right now. Tell the others.

SCP-HR009-J,"""Eye-Grabbing Clickbait Title""","""Item #: SCP-HR009-J 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: Actions determined to be influenced by SCP-HR009-J are to be reported to the Human Resources Division immediately. Persons affected by SCP-HR009-J shall be remanded for reeducation Positive Action Plan Workshops, and possibly subject to demotion compensation and benefits fun-sizing as cases merit. 
 All documents affected by SCP-HR009-J are to be handled in accordance with the Deletions Guide. 
 Description: SCP-HR009-J is a phenomenon affecting official documentation within the Foundation. Reports, files, memoranda and other documents affected by SCP-HR009-J display characteristics inconsistent with established scientific and professional practices, especially those developed internally by the Foundation. SCP-HR009-J has been known to affect database files for anomalies, personnel records, electronic file directories, incident reports, and e-mails (especially those originating from Dr. ████ ""Incapable of its/it's Distinction"" ████████'s desk). 
 Documentation practices such as those caused by SCP-HR009-J are theoretically within established baseline human behavior. However, given the extensive selection process for Foundation personnel and the rigorous qualifications standards enforced by the Human Resources Division, behavior such as that caused by SCP-HR009-J can have no other cause than deficiencies in the rationally observable laws of spacetime. 
 Addendum HR009-J.1 - Corruption of Directory Filenames 
 SCP-HR009-J.1 has exhibited a tendency to induce staff to produce anomalously inappropriate names for files cataloguing contained anomalous phenomena. These have included the following instances: 
 SCP-████ - G A R B A G E B A G F U L L O F S E A M O N K E Y S 
 SCP-████ - Researcher Floyd is a Jerk Who is Wrong About Everything and is also a Jerk1 
 SCP-████ - The Original [appears courtesy of a very confused sculptor][please don't use this picture ever][please don't sue the hell out of us]

 SCP-████ - Ow, My Ovaries 
 SCP-████ - [ACCESS DENIED]4 
 Addendum HR009-J.2 - Breach of Personnel Records Database 
 Per established procedure, the Foundation maintains comprehensive records of staff. These records chronicle employee assignments, completed projects, current research, and performance notes. However, in violation of any semblance of consensus reality, SCP-HR009-J has affected a number of these files, resulting in the following records that would be professionally unacceptable, were they compiled by a functioning human: 
 Site Director Randolph Jesperson - Personnel file replaced with semi-readable document composed primarily of seventeen viewing tabs, each of which leading to a further seventeen viewing tabs. This led to a performance review being unable to determine which location Site Director Jesperson was actually in charge of. 
 Technician John Williamson - The only accessible records for Technician Williamson consisted of a narrative about a fictionalized, competent version of the employee, serving in a lead role on a Mobile Task Force that was somehow issued firearms in order to research text-based anomalies in the field. Comments have been disabled on Technician Williamson's personnel file until further notice. 
 Researcher Saito Akane - Personnel file replaced with a line of text reading, ""i'll get around to putting something here,"" followed by a timer counting down to November 6, 2347. 
 Technician Jørgen Eriksen - Possibly the most complex example of SCP-HR009-J, this personnel file was replaced with an open comment thread, in which dozens of personnel affected by the anomaly proceeded to post incomprehensible, low-information content. This incident was similar to SCP-████, a phenomenon affecting multiple Sites that was ultimately decommissioned by a 13-0 Overseer Council vote after being deemed to have no worthwhile research utility. 
 Senior Researcher Ana Montoya - Mission-critical details on each project to which Senior Researcher Montoya has been assigned replaced with extended commentary regarding personal feelings and unrelated observations regarding writing process, in most cases exceeding the amount of documentation extant for each SCP object. 
 Armed Site-04 Security Chief Xu Qiliang - Personnel file consisted of nothing but bullet points listing Security Chief Xu's assignments, with no additional information or performance notes of any kind. Review of this instance of SCP-HR009-J is ongoing, as personnel continually fall asleep during attempts to research it. 
 Addendum HR009-J.3 - Anomalously Inappropriate Addenda 
 Several database entries for anomalous phenomena and objects have been corrupted, and now feature inexplicable narratives composed in the form of letters and notes, purporting to explain the origins of the SCP object in question. The appearance of these notes in official documentation do not conform to the physical laws of the observable universe, as any researcher lazy enough to simply include these narratives in the belief that they have explanatory value would have been reassigned to a long-term amnestic-aided civilian infiltration assignment long ago. 
 A listing of known instances follows: 
 Addendum 106.2 - Document Pinned to SCP-106's Forehead - ""My dearest Claire, I know how in your heart, you have always desired a scary old man covered in caustic goo, who can walk through walls and jump out at you. Alas, of all my efforts to prove my love to you, 'twas this one that I could not complete while you were still among us. I can only hope that wherever you are, that your beautiful smile lights up your face as you look down on us below, capering with this hideous monster that delights in inflicting unending torment for no real reason. Sincerely, Claude."" 
 Addendum 1733.2 - Sticky Note Found Attached Underneath DVR, Which Was Recovered After Several Years of Research for Some Reason - ""LeBron James is the Michael Jordan of NEVER WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP LOL u just got clowned son XD XD. - Todd5"" 
 Addendum 2000-3: - The following letter was discovered taped to Clone Vat #B19 upon a routine cleaning: 
 ""Where to begin. I guess it all starts with my love of Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Who wouldn't appreciate things like mystery-solving great danes and a great white shark that plays the drums in a rock band? Classic. Now see here, I know I can't actually visit Jellystone Park because it doesn't exist. I'm not a child. But I can visit Yellowstone Park. Oh yes. 
 Like all things in life, reality simply does not live up to the Hanna-Barberaverse. Sure, there were bears of varying sizes. And yes, they did occasionally steal pic-a-nic baskets from the unwary. There was even a particularly diligent park ranger that would give chase to the bears on these occasions, though he was probably pursuing the bears out of senility instead of duty. But it just wasn't the same. Where was the hat and tie? Where are the light hearted hijinks, when all the bears want to do is dig out the entrails of a nearby deer carcass? Where's the fun? 
 There was only one thing left to do. Create a giant underground complex where I could let bears evolve into a more perfected Yogi-like form, while keeping humanity the same over the course of the millions of years that it would take to do this. What good is a bipedal bear announcing itself with ""hey Boo-Boo"" if there's no one there to properly appreciate it? 
 At the end of my long life, I've made great strides. One sub-species of the park's local grizzly bears is definitely smaller, though sadly this appears to have made them much angrier, complicating their eventual role as a sidekick organism. And the other grizzlies now seem to prefer human-introduced foods in their diets, at the cost of the less-humorous business of increased tourist maulings. But there's much more work to be done. So much more. 
 I leave it to you, generations of the future, to put this great machine to its highest use. Remember Yogi, Boo-Boo, and Ranger Smith.""""",,+185,active,computer document joke keter meta mind-affecting scp the-old-man,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-hr009-j
SCP-Jaguar-J,"""Junior Researcher Hutchins' Incredible Automobile""","""Item #: SCP-Jaguar-J 
 Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-Jaguar-J is not currently capable of being contained, due to an uncertainty as to its position. Agents deployed to the zone SCP-Jaguar-J is supposedly situated has not resulted in confirmed visual contact. Inspections of all nearby auto repair shops within a 7 mile radius of this location disproved Researcher Hutchin's claims of its current status. 
 Description: SCP-Jaguar-J is an anomalous automobile which is hypothetically owned by Researcher Hutchins. Although all known documentation of SCP-Jaguar-J depict a total lemon, it has been vehemently claimed by Researcher Hutchins that these photographs are an anomaly, and that when viewed with the eye it appears to be a Jaguar luxury automobile. These claims have not been substantiated. 
 Dr. Hutchins has been making such claims since he was a Junior Staff Member on the SCP-2600 research team, and despite persistent attempts to view it has always been unable to show any of the Site 88 staff. Despite hosting the annual Site-88 Decemberween party on multiple occasions, not one individual has reported seeing SCP-Jaguar-J. During visual inspection of the garage only a large empty patch of concrete covered with oils and unidentified metallic parts were found. 
 Should Researcher Hutchins ever be able to provide substantiated evidence of SCP-Jaguar-J, he will be promoted to a full Operations Researcher and be assigned as the lead science adviser on all SCP-Jaguar-J testing. 
 Researcher Notes(2) 
 Come on guys. This is unprofessional. I joined the SCP Foundation because I thought you guys would be into this sort of thing. I have to take it to the shop a lot because insurance companies won't cover me with the pictures. Also, one time my girlfriend from up in Canada came down and borrowed it to go meet a man about a horse. You guys are really not taking this as seriously as you should. I've had this car for years, if you came when I said it was there you'd totally see I'm telling the truth. — Researcher Hutchins. 
 Fine. It is possible that SCP-Jaguar-J may also be of the Jaguar XKR-S model, but due to the lack of visual evidence I predict this visit will result in an SCP-Jaguar-XK-End-of-Your-Lies scenario. — Dr. Morse. 
 Addendum Jaguar-XE: After the deployment of Mobile Truth Force Lie-7 ""Randi's Pants, On Fire"" it was discovered that SCP-Jaguar-J did in fact exist and displayed surprisingly accurate anomalous properties. As promised, Junior Researcher Hutchins has been given Level 1 Clearance and the title of Operational Researcher. He is currently assigned to work on SCP-Jaguar-J. 
 Testing Location: Site-88 Indoor Testing Region 
 Hypothesis: SCP-Jaguar-J may display different anomalous properties with different paint configurations, seating adjustments, option alterations, or another anomalous component causing the entire machine to display this anomalous phenomenon. Due to Researcher Hutchin's lack of mechanical expertise, he will observe from the upper viewing deck. 
 [VIDEO TRANSCRIPT] 
 [00:00-03:45](Researcher Hutchins stares dejectedly at SCP-Jaguar-J as it is disassembled by mechanical personnel.) 
 [03:45]Researcher Hutchins:(Intercom) Can I at least sit in the seat for a little? 
 [03:51]Scruffy:(In testing chamber) Nope.

SCP-K9-J-EX,"""The Haunted House""","""Item #: SCP-K9-J-EX 
 Object Class: Keter Solved 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-K9-J has been abandoned, due to hauntings. Its property value is expected to drop significantly, making it a steal for anyone who is willing to buy it in spite of the hauntings. 
 Description: SCP-K9-J is a large, Victorian household filled with several squeaky floorboards, cobwebs, and a kitchen that is always stocked with food. SCP-K9-J was originally built by an old Scottish lord who died ~50 years ago, stating on his deathbed that he would seek vengeance upon any person who dared to disturb his manor. 
 SCP-K9-J-1 appears in SCP-K9-J upon investigation of the household. SCP-K9-J-1 frightens off any and all potential customers of SCP-K9-J. Further investigation would be performed into SCP-K9-J-1's properties, but it's a GH-GH-GHOOOOOOST! 
 SCP-K9-J-2 is a hallway within SCP-K9-J that has a non-euclidean geometry. When rock or pop music is played and SCP-K9-J-1 pursues (a) subject(s) into SCP-K9-J-2, any doorway entered into in SCP-K9-J-2 will lead out another doorway within SCP-K9-J-2. Subject(s) may find themselves running alone, with each other, or with SCP-K9-J-1. This effect persists until any or all parties trip or attack one another. 
 Addendum K9-J-A: Wow, what a shame. I'll buy this and take it off your guys's hands! - Dr. Jenkins 
 Addendum K9-J-B: Incidents involving SCP-K9-J: 
 Incident K9-J-A: Renovation workers were renovating what is now SCP-K9-J. They were then attacked by SCP-K9-J-1. No casualties were reported, however worker equipment was destroyed and victims were purportedly ""spooked"". 
 Incident K9-J-B: Mobile Task Force Mu 4 sent into SCP-K9-J to investigate. 
 Incident K9-J-C: After ""splitting up"", Agents Mu 4-4 and Mu 4-5 were engorging themselves upon the food discovered in SCP-K9-J's kitchen. They were then attacked by SCP-K9-J-1, which chased them throughout SCP-K9-J. The agents successfully tricked SCP-K9-J-1 by ""like, convincing it that we were make-up artists, man. We spun it around a bunch of times and it was, like, dizzy, man. We still gave it a make over, though. Ehehehehe."" Agents Mu 4-4 and Mu 4-5 were able to rendezvous with the rest of the MTF following this distraction. 
 Jinkies! - Agent Mu 4-3 
 Incident K9-J-D: Agent Mu 4-1 was able to convince Agents Mu 4-4 and 4-5 to act as ""bait"" utilizing [REDACTED]. Agent Mu 4-1 reportedly had to give them two [REDACTED] each. Disciplinary evaluation of Agents Mu 4-4 and 4-5 is underway. 
 Incident K9-J-F: Agent Mu 4-3 loses her glasses. She can't see without her glasses. 
 Incident K9-J-G: Agent Mu 4-2 fights off SCP-K9-J-1 using previously unexpected skill. Although the use of Agents Mu 4-4 and Mu 4-5 as bait was not successful, SCP-K9-J-1 was contained by MTF Mu 4 after it became stuck under a fallen bookshelf. 
 I knew it wasn't a ghost ever since I saw those accounting reports about the house pricing. This ghoul is actually… - Agent Mu 4-3 
 Dr. Jenkins!? - Agents Mu 4-1, 4-2, and 4-4 
 Oooh, I was just about to get this house for rock bottom prices. And I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for Mobile Task Force Mu-4 ""Meddling Kids""! - Dr. Jenkins 
 Incident K9-J-H: A second instance of SCP-K9-J-1 was reported following Incident K9-J-G, but this was soon revealed to be Agent Mu 4-5 wearing a bed sheet. 
 Rooby rooby [REDACTED] - Agent Mu 4-5

It wasn't on paper? Just electronic documentation? That's right, he's saying they had to move to electronic documentation eventually. Well that's what he's saying, I'm just telling you what he is saying to me. Well maybe you're confused because it sounds like they did have paper documentation at one time, I don't know. I'm just going by what he's telling me.

The online-network page's cognitohazardous ramifications materialize in consequence to a human being's inceptive examination. Influenced human beings are incompetent at scribing or verbalizing without uselessly obfuscating the contents through means of the online-network page. 
 Appendix MWT-J.1: Supervisor Parliament Correspondence 
 The Foundation is no stranger to falsifying files for the sake of information security. Hell, practically half of the database doesn't actually exist. We place warning signs and memetic kill agents in places where they shouldn't be so that the poor bastard who finds these files without the proper authorization is scared half to death before they could actually be terminated. 
 This isn't the case with MWT-J. The truth is: everyone can access MWT-J, it's included in general Level 0 access. MWT-J is not about some world ending anomaly, the containment procedures do not protect humanity. MWT-J doesn't even exist, the civilian sector uses it daily without problem. No, MWT-J's file exists for one sole reason: 
 So the new hires would stop using Thesaurus.com so much.

SCP-PU1P-J,"""A PULPy Machine""","""Object Class: E(pic)uclid 
 Special Containment Procedures: Copies of SCP-PU1P-J-1 are to be disseminated across as many Foundation sites as possible, and an annual budget of USD $500 is to be allocated to SCP-PU1P-J-1 production. SCP-PU1P-J is to be contained in the Site-75 break room, for ease of staff use. SCP-PU1P-J and it's contents are to be ""tested"" regularly, for general entertainment purposes. 
 Description: SCP-PU1P-J appears to be a standard slot machine adorned with detailed art of Foundation staff and anomalies1, drawn in a classic comic style. The machine only has three spinning slot sections as opposed to the typical five. The left slot contains names or designations of different Foundation personnel and anomalies, while the right contains a ""premise""2 
 SCP-PU1P-J’s anomalous effect manifests when .10¢ USD is slid into the token slot and the lever on the right side of the box is pulled downwards. This will cause the slots to spin, and a presumably random figure and premise will be selected. The middle column does not move and only contains the letter “X”. SCP-PU1P-J then enters a “hibernation state” in which the machine cannot be interacted with, and money is no longer accepted. After exactly 2 hours, a ""pulp magazine"" with a heavily stylized cover and title will be produced. 
 The magazine, now designated SCP-PU1P-J-1, contains a short story which details the exploits of the chosen character within the chosen premise. These stories are usually not of excellent quality, but are generally entertaining, being very reminiscent of pulp magazines of the early 1900s. 
 On the underside of the box is a note, scrawled in pen: 
 I am so sorry. That last thing I sent was not tested well, and was much worse than anticipated. Not even you guys deserve that. I, Cornelius Everett Wondertainment, have crafted this writing box, which should produce works of genuine entertainment value. 
 it was just a prank bro please don't be mad. 
 Cordially, Dr. Wondertainment 
 Addendum PU1P-J.1: Wobbles, an undercover cop in New York City 
 The year was 1923. Everything was in black-and-white, as it always had been. Wobbles the shark was backed against a wall, three of his former compatriots, members of a gang known as the ""Jets"" in New York, trained their eyes on him, flexing their arms. 
 ""I may be a lot of things, like a shark, but one thing I'm not is a goddamn snitch!"" Wobbles exclaimed through his fishbowl helmet full of water, ""I'm no cop, honest! I love the Jets and also doing crime and stuff!"" 
 The mobster in the center stepped forwards towards Wobbles and held his fist forwards. 
 ""Tell that to 'The Judge'"" he said, motioning towards his right fist, ""That's what I named my fist… The Judge."" 
 ""No, yeah I think we all got that, you really didn't have to explain it, right guys?"" 
 The two other mobsters gave each other a look and shrugged in agreement. 
 ""DON'T GIVE HIM THE SATISFACTION OF LETTING HIM KNOW HE'S RIGHT, YOU IMBECILES!"" the center man was already frothing, motioning with his poorly-named fist at Wobbles. The two other men were shocked for a second, before quickly retraining their unnamed fists at Wobbles. 
 ""Ready! Aim! PUNCH!"" 
 All three men unloaded on the shark, fists sailing towards the Super Selachian. A cloud of smoke puffed up, and a loud, wet thump could be heard. When the dust cleared, Wobbles was on the ground. 
 ""Let's clean this up before the pigs get here."" 
 All three men went to pick up the body of Wobbles, but their hands bounced off, unable to touch him. Confused, the man on the left took a closer look at Wobbles's body.
""Hey booooooss? Where did the wounds go? There are no wounds on this shark!""
Suddenly, Wobbles jumped back up onto his tail, the surprise causing the three men to back up. Wobbles pulled a cigarette out of the pocket of the central man, utilizing his shock. Wobbles lit the cigarette and held it up to his fishbowl. Inexplicably, the cigarette glowed at the tip more, and a puff of smoke was exhaled by Wobbles, clouding his helmet in smoke despite his lack of human lungs. 
 ""Alright, I guess the jig is up. I am an undercover cop. But I've learned all I need to know."" 
 Wobbles walked closer to the men, as they pressed up against the other side of the room. Wobbles imitated the motion of pulling up his sleeves. 
 ""Now it looks like the punch is on the other hand! Or should I say… fin?!?"" 
 Addendum PU1P.2: SCP-4455 (""AKA: Streamliner""), a detective in Chicago. 
 Streamliner was approached by a woman whose husband had died. After investigating the crime scene and finding the murder weapon, Streamliner apprehended the culprit and put him in jail. 
 Addendum PU1P.3: SCP-3388, robbing a bank in Atlanta 
 carnie? 
 Yes? 
 what are we doing? 
 I've explained this several times, we're robbing a bank so that you start getting tougher. Think of it as training. 
 there are lots of water and rocks here. 
 No poky! No murder! You can't show a dead person how tough you are. Choose your murder wisely. 
 but i'm thirsty. 
 We can get water after. Let's just rob this place and get out. 
 okay. 
 If Carnegias could grin in this moon cactus form, he would be. His small protege, poky, had gotten much better at this whole flying thing and was starting to slowly float into the air. The phenomenon attracted the attention of several bank-goers, who rubbed their eyes in disbelief. Carnegias mustered all of his telepathic strength to send out a loud message to everyone at the bank. 
 Several bank-goers and bankers looked on confusedly. Some began to chuckle at how preposterous the situation was. 
 ""Hey, whoever has the thin string on the cactus and the megaphone, the magic show is down the road!"" a man in the back jeered. 
 are they making fun of me, carnie? 
 Yeah but only because you aren't acting tough enough! You gotta send a message. 
 i thought you said no murder. 
 I change my mind, this guy is a jerk and should go away. 
 okay. i'm thirsty anyway. 
 The laughter stopped. The man stood there, starting to wrinkle and dry visibly. 
 ""Wha-what is happe-"" 
 The middle-aged man contorted in agony, his body becoming more and more dry, his skin wrinkling like somebody three times his age. Suddenly the skin began to fold in on itself, losing its color in favor of a pale white. The convulsions stopped. Blood seeped from the side of poky's pot. 
 Good, poky! Alright, you got their attention now. Tell them to give you their valuables. 
 That was not very intimidating. 
 A security guard finally snapped out of his confusion and approached the floating moon cactus. Tentatively drawing his gun, he took aim at poky. 
 poky! Watch out! 
 aaahhh! 
 The security guard's finger began to close on the trigger, but not before a sudden CRACK reverberated around the room. The security guard's head had been violently snapped a full one hundred and eighty degrees. Wordlessly, he expelled a final breath and toppled over. 
 Goddamn, poky. 
 Alright poky, I think you got the- 
 Suddenly, the entire room's eyes glassed over, clouding into a deep black which seemed to contain an infinite abyss. And then the screams. The entire room doubled over, or fell over, contorting their bodies in fear, screaming all the while. 
 oh no i did it again. 
 It's alright, just put them back now. I think they get the point. 
 i can't, it's a never-ending nightmare. 
 poky, that's a figure of speech, you didn't actually have to make it never-ending. 
 you didn't explain that! this is too hard! 
 Hey, hey, you did a great job! You were super tough here! Next time you just have to make sure that a few of them stay alive enough to tell people of how scary you are. 
 and then they give water? 
 They'll fear you so much that you can get all the water you want. 
 yay. 
 Collecting the money, Carnegias and poky exited the Secure Collecting Proprietor's Bank. The alarm finally began to clamor at the Bank. In the distance, sirens began to blare. 
 Okay, let's head over to the next city so there's no heat on us. 
 kill cops? 
 No, don't kill the cops, not until I am powerful enough to take on the Foundation again. 
 we are powerful enough 
 Right, yes, we. 
 Carnegias and poky floated past the city, into the distance. 
 Armando exited the bathroom in the Secure Collecting Proprietor's Bank to utter chaos. People rolling on the floor in pain, their eyes blackened and their throats hoarse from screaming. Armando steeled himself for a fight, but there was nobody left to fight. 
 ""Goddamnit! Why does this always happen when I go to the bathroom?!?"" 
 Addendum PU1P.4: SCP-682, saving the world. 
 ""Aha!"" the Mad Doctor screeched, ""My plans are finally coming to fruition! And there's nothing you can do about it, 682!"" 
 Acid. Why did it have to be acid? 682 thought, ""Just you wait, Doctor! As soon as I get out of this pit of acid you have put me in, I WILL save the world from your mass containment breach!"" 
 ""Is this really what we're doing?"" an actor submerged in a pool of green water in a reptile costume inquired, exasperated, ""682 saves the world from the evil Foundation?"" 
 ""CUT!"" the director yelled, ""Yes, this is what we are doing because it's what you're getting paid for. Now say your goddamn lines and we'll make you less of a shit actor in post."" 
 ""Fuck you. Just get rolling again or whatever so I can go home."" 
 ""From that section! Action!"" 
 ""You FOOL."" the Mad Doctor exclaimed, ""Even if you are impossible to kill, I can keep you trapped here as long as there is acid in that tank!"" 
 ""Well then."" 682 said, pulling out a lighter which he had been hiding in a pocket of skin, ""Sure would be a shame if I burned all of this acid away, wouldn't it?"" 
 ""What? Can you do that?"" 
 ""Point of clarification, can he do that?"" the Mad Doctor actor shouted from the rafter. 
 ""CUT!"" the director put his head in his hands, annoyed, ""I don't know shit about acid but I'm 90% sure it burns. And even if it doesn't is it YOUR job to ask ME that?"" 
 ""No, sir."" 
 ""Alright then, how about you do your GODDAMN JOBS and STOP QUESTIONING MY ART? ACTION!"" 
 ""Good grief."" 682 said with a light chuckle, ""You really shouldn't have used the flammable acid. 
 682 proceeds to light a cigarette, and takes a heavy puff. It's so powerful that it fills the room with smoke, obscuring the Mad Doctor's vision. And the lighter is dropped. The room erupts in raucous flames, the heat causing the Mad Doctor to drop to one knee and stumble. When the Mad Doctor looks back up, 682 has joined him on the rafter, burnt but unhurt. 682 takes another long puff of his cigarette. 
 ""Want a smoke?"" 682 asks, before rushing up to the Mad Doctor to mau- 
 ""Seriously?"" the 682 actor exclaimed sarcastically, stopping his run, ""THAT'S his catchphrase? 'Want a smoke?' That doesn't even make sense! He's a reptile thing!"" 
 ""THAT'S IT!"" the director was turning purple at this point, ""YOU'RE BOTH SHIT. YOU'RE BOTH FIRED. GET THE FUCK OUT!"" 
 ""I don't even want to be in this dumb project, so you can SUCK IT!"" 
 ""Yeah, fuck you!"" the Mad Doctor actor started to walk off the platform, ""Your story sucks anyway."" 
 The director cut the back half of the 682 costume and the front half of the Mad Doctor costume, sewing them together into a not-very functional costume. 
 ""HEY!"" the director looked around confusedly, ""WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?!?"" 
 All of the crew had quietly walked away while the director was sewing, not wanting to participate in a project with no actors. 
 ""Well, FUCK ALL OF YOU, because I'M GONNA DO THE WHOLE MOVIE MYSELF."" 
 The director wiped some of his angry tears away and set the camera rolling, positioning himself on the platform to play both roles at once. 
 ""ACTION!"" 
 The Author wipes away a light tear of joy at his masterpiece. 
 This'll show all of those haters what kind of PAIN they put me through. I'm not an edgelord, I am a misunderstood artist, and they'll have to learn to love me! 
 ""Hey, Morgan!"" The Author exclaimed, ""Come read my deconstruction of writing culture!"" 
 A begrudged younger boy trudged into The Author's room. 
 ""Bro, it's 3 in the morning, unlike you, I gotta go to school tomorrow."" Morgan wiped his bleary eyes. 
 ""No man, just read this and tell me what you think, I need critiquing."" 
 ""Fucking… fine, whatever."" 
 Morgan peered at the laptop screen in confusion, while The Author excitedly looked at Morgan's face for a reaction. 
 ""Dude, what the hell is this? Why is it so weird and meta?"" 
 ""You obviously don't understand writing, it's a clap back to all of those people who called my writing weird and edgy."" 
 ""Yeah but like, is this the best way to do it? In an incredibly self-referential and insulting way?"" 
 ""Listen, if I just say it's a joke, everybody will like it and I get to write whatever I want."" 
 ""But is all of your work being regarded as a joke a good thing? Maybe if you went to school more you would be better at writing."" 
 ""Fuck you! This is going to be my magnum opus, whether you like it or not!"" 
 ""Whatever. It's your funeral."" 
 The Real Author examined his terminal screen. 
 Hmm, maybe let's put some more CSS in here so it looks better. Hopefully, the message is clear enough. 
 The Real Author reached out to grab his Mountain Dew. As he held it up to his mouth, the chicken grease on his fingers caused the Mountain Dew to slip, the contents of the soda spilling into his PC. 
 ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MY MAGNUM OPUS! I COULDN'T EVEN ADD ONE MORE LEVEL OF META!"" 
 AUTHOR'S JOURNAL: 3/12/2019
 
Dear Journal. Today I tried to write something, but I ended up not liking it that much. I think I will just delete it at some point soon.
 
It's like… ugh I had a point somewhere in there but it just kept getting more and more meta and I just couldn't think of where to go from there. At some point, I just started insulting myself. It was weird.
 
I honestly could post it though. I'm pretty sure I could just call it an SCP and throw it on that website. They have low standards. Depends on how I feel in the morning.
 
Anyway, journal, I gotta get back to spending time with my loving partner and my seven adopted children who love me and love living in this mansion that I own and bought with my book royalties, so I'll be back after the daily feast we call dinner. I sure do love being a successful beloved author.

SCP-ROCKS-J,"""A Pile Of Rocks That Need To Shut The Hell Up""","""Object Class: Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-ROCKS-J are to be stored in a soundproof container large enough to contain all twenty-six instances. As instances of SCP-ROCKS-J have reacted negatively to being separated from one another, instances have been allowed to be contained in the same container as long as they keep disputes and arguments to a minimum. 
 Description: SCP-ROCKS-J refers to a total of twenty-six varying types of large river rocks. All instances are fully sentient and capable of vocal communication despite lacking mouths. All instances speak in an identical, loud, high-pitched voice. Each instance bares a pair of large googly eyes, which despite appearing non-anomalous, allow instances to visually perceive their surroundings. All instances of SCP-ROCKS-J are capable of minor telekinesis which they use to move. Instances are unable to use their abilities on any life forms or objects other than themselves. 
 Instances of SCP-ROCKS-J have been designated SCP-ROCKS-J-A to Z. 
 SCP-ROCKS-J are considered non-threatening to Foundation staff. Instances show a low level of intelligence and lack the ability to pay attention to one specific subject for even short amounts of time and on occasion experience severe memory loss. With instances often forgetting personnel and previously learned information. 
 SCP-ROCKS-J was discovered in ██████ river located in █████, England. Instances at the time of discovery were attempting to communicate with a nearby pigeon. This ended with an instance of SCP-ROCKS-J having apparently become ‘inspired’, and proceed to perform a rap about pigeons1.

 Dr. Agnew: Good evening, I’m doctor Agnew.

 SCP-ROCKS-J-A: Our names are Bob, Steve, Jessica, Rodrick, Kyle, Carl, Karl with a ‘k’, Jessica again, Paul, Kevin, Steve again- 
 Dr. Agnew: Er… don’t worry, there’s no need to tell me all of your names. I was hoping a few of you could share some useful information regarding your origins or biology? 
 SCP-ROCKS-J-A: It shall be me! I speak for the rocks.

 SCP-ROCKS-J-A: Shut it Bob. You lost the right to speak up in the last rock committee meeting!

 SCP-ROCKS-J-B: They do not! They can plainly see that we are rocks just by looking at us! And also ones with big glorious eyes on them! 
 (SCP-ROCKS-J-B turns to Dr. Agnew and begins shaking intensely for several seconds, causing its googly eyes to shake rapidly.)

 Post interview report: Upon leaving the interview room, SCP-ROCKS-J continued to vocalise the word ‘hail’ for the following ten minutes. SCP-ROCKS-J eventually ceased this behaviour, apparently forgetting what they had been doing. Following this, instances appeared to have a discussion regarding the hierarchy of their group. This later ended with instances organising a hierarchy amongst themselves consisting of royal titles of various continents, all of which were altered to feature the word ‘rock’ or a type of rock.

SCP-SAFE-J,"""Some safes""","""Item #: SCP-SAFE-J 
 Object Class: Safe, Euclid, and Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: The dangers and difficulties of the safe and unsafe aspects of SCP-SAFE-J are still being determined. Please use your safest judgment when dealing with SCP-SAFE-J-A (the Safe component of SCP-SAFE-J), SCP-SAFE-J-B (the Euclid component of SCP-SAFE-J), and SCP-SAFE-J-C (the Keter component of SCP-SAFE-J). 
 Description: SCP-SAFE-J is a set of 3 safes (all █████ ████ brand safes), which are visually identical to each other. SCP-SAFE-J-A is a Safe safe, SCP-SAFE-J-B is a Euclid safe, and SCP-SAFE-J-C is a Keter safe. Whilst the safety of each safe is implied by its object class (whether Safe or not Safe), the practical safety of each safe is outlined below. 
 The Safe safe is safe for testing, and needs no extensive containment. The Euclid safe is safe, so long as it's not near the Keter safe, in which case only the Safe safe can return the Euclid safe back to safe. The Keter safe is never safe - its in-progress containment procedures attempt to keep this safe as safe as the Safe safe, but the Keter safe will never be as safe as the Safe safe or the Euclid safe. 
 Current staff assigned to the SCP-SAFE-J safes are Dr. Safe, Dr. Euclid, and Dr. Keter. Dr. Safe is in charge of the Safe safe, Dr. Euclid is in charge of the Euclid safe, and Dr. Keter helps with both the Safe safe and the Euclid safe. The Keter safe is overseen by all three doctors, and it takes the combined efforts of Dr. Safe, Dr. Euclid, and Dr. Keter to ensure that the Keter safe is as safe as Dr. Safe's Safe safe and Dr. Euclid's Euclid safe. 
 Recently, it's been found that macro-scale microwave emissions into Euclidean space by the Keter safe can heat up and thaw out food, drink, and other groupings of items that would be considered a meal. The meals thawed by the Keter safe's ability to thaw meals are designated SCP-SAFE-J-D, and can be used to keep the Keter safe safe (giving the thawed meals a Thaumiel object class). Thaumiel thawed meals are safe to use on Dr. Safe's Safe safe, Dr. Euclid's Euclid safe, and Drs. Safe, Euclid, and Keter's unsafe Keter safe. The safety of the doctors' Keter safe's Euclidian intrusion of macro-scale microwave emissions, and the safety of Thaumiel meals thawed by its ability to thaw meals, have been confirmed to be safe (but not Safe) by Dr. Safe, Dr. Euclid, and Dr. Keter. 
 Safe to say, when all components of SCP-SAFE-J are safely contained (Dr. Safe's Safe safe, Dr. Euclid's Euclid safe, Drs. Safe, Euclid, and Keter's Keter safe, and the safe Thaumiel thawed meals caused by the safe (but not Safe) macro-scale microwave emissions into Euclidean space by the Drs. Safe, Euclid, and Keter's unsafe Keter safe), the whole entity of SCP-SAFE-J is considered Safe.""","""SCP-SAFE-J""",+642,active,_cc container joke metallic safe scp thermodynamic,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-safe-j

 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-SCP-J is to be kept in a hermetically sealed containment vault at Site-58 in the hope that it might suffocate or starve to death, though the Foundation acknowledges that such a wonderful possibility actually coming to fruition is ill-becoming of anything associated with SCP-SCP-J. Under no circumstances is SCP-SCP-J to be let out. In the event that Site-58 becomes compromised through one or more Euclid or Keter containment breaches, SCP-SCP-J is to be given first priority as an unfortunate casualty. 
 Description: SCP-SCP-J, formerly known as ""Scippy,"" is a cartoon mascot found in training videos for D-class personnel prior to 1994. After retirement on 1/15/1995, SCP-SCP-J worked as a class-B containment specialist at Site-58. 
 SCP-SCP-J's anomalous qualities became apparent when personnel at Site-58 attempted to perform any kind of official work. 
 Incident log 5/8/95: 
 Dr. Henderson: Everybody out. SCP-████ is breaching containment. I need all mission-critical personnel to follow— 
 SCP-SCP-J: It looks like you're dealing with a containment breach. Would you like some help? 
 Dr. Henderson: Not the time, Scippy. 
 SCP-SCP-J: The time is currently 5:23 PM. But perhaps you should focus on the matter at hand - containment breaches are very serious problems that must be addressed with your full attention! Have you notified the breach desk? 
 Dr. Henderson: Get out of the way. I have to get to the containment chamber. 
 SCP-SCP-J: The containment chamber? Incorrect. In the event of a containment breach, the breach desk should be notified. This is step one. Step two— 
 Dr. Henderson: I will feed you head-first into a non-anomalous woodchipper if you don't get out of my fucking way this minute! 
 SCP-SCP-J: That does not sound like it would be a productive use of your time, especially during a containment breach. Would you like me to contact the breach desk for you?

 ""Punching"" = that Japanimation or whatever cartoon my horrid little nephew Craighden likes = scantily-clad cartoon women = S-E-X = Human Trafficking.

SCP-SPDR-J,"""Arachnophobic Colleague""","""Item #: SCP-SPDR-J 
 Object Class: I felt something touch my foot 
 Special Containment Procedures: Sightings of SCP-SPDR-J are not a big deal, and do not need to be reported. Should SCP-SPDR-J be encountered in the office of Researcher Jenner, no action is to be taken unless Jenner happens to notice it because trust me, she will make it everyone's problem until MTF Ω-9 (Paperboys) manages to extract SCP-SPDR-J with a newspaper and a glass jar. Capture is to be performed with caution, like could you imagine that thing scittering up your arm1. 
 Following an encounter with SCP-SPDR-J, Researcher Jenner is to be escorted into the site break room, and convinced SCP-SPDR-J has been removed from the site premises. 
 Description: SCP-SPDR-J is a small arachnid currently located somewhere in the premises of Site-67. SCP-SPDR-J usually exhibits behavior similar to other web building spiders, with the notable exception of being able to utilize teleportation to avoid predators. 
 This ability is almost exclusively used in a situation where Researcher Jenner spots SCP-SPDR-J, and exits the room to either seek help or a tool to neutralize it with. Upon returning to the room, SCP-SPDR-J will have disappeared, much to the horror of Researcher Jenner, upon which everyone within close proximity to Jenner's office usually have to stop their work to help her in order to have her calm the flip down. 
 SCP-SPDR-J was first encountered 14/5/2008 in Researcher Jenner's office by Researcher Stork who then pointed out the presence of the anomaly to Jenner, who immediately recognized the threat and proceeded to verbally set the alarm. SCP-SPDR-J's teleportation ability and its tendency to hide made confirming the presence of the anomaly very difficult, but several hours and many vocal alarms later the anomaly was contained in a glass jar and moved into the flowerbed outside where SCP-SPDR-J is assumed to reside to this day. Researcher Jenner was presented with an award for her quick response to the threat which no one cared about.

 DATE: 14/5/2008 
 NOTE: The following video log depicts the first encounter with SCP-SPDR-J. 
 [BEGIN LOG] 
 10:58: Researchers Jenner and Stork are conversing in Jenner's office. Stork's attention is caught by something moving next to a decorative SpongeBob SquarePants-clock which rests on a small table located in the corner of the office. 
 10:59: Researcher Stork identifies the movement as a spider, and points it out to Researcher Jenner who proceeds to stand up and retreat to the corner farthest away from the spider. 
 11:00: Researcher Stork moves to the spider and pretends to catch it in his fist. He then approaches Researcher Jenner with his fist clenched shut and his arm stretched forward, encouraging Jenner to view the spider. Jenner begins screaming and begging Stork to get away. 
 11:01: Stork laughs and informs Jenner that the spider is still on the table. Researcher Savos enters the room to investigate the reason for Jenner's distressed vocalization. Jenner screams and runs out of the office. 
 11:02: Stork is unable to locate the spider again. Stork and Savos laugh and exit the room.

 DATE: 14/5/2008 
 NOTE: Researcher Jenner had returned to her office nearly an hour later after having been convinced that SCP-SPDR-J was no longer present in her office. 
 [BEGIN LOG] 
 11:54: Researcher Jenner is seen sitting by her desk. 
 12:15: Jenner spots SCP-SPDR-J standing still next to the foot of her desk. Jenner immediately jumps from her seat and runs out of the office room while screaming. 
 12:16: Researcher Jenner returns to the office armed with a rolled up newspaper, only to discover SCP-SPDR-J is no longer where it was last seen. Jenner looks around her before running out of the room again. 
 12:18: Jenner returns along with researchers Stork and Savos, who she demands to locate SCP-SPDR-J. The two researchers agree so they could get back to work. 
 [The researchers spend the next 13 minutes searching for SCP-SPDR-J to no avail.] 
 12:32: Researcher Jenner leaves the room once more, informing she won't be returning until SCP-SPDR-J is contained. 
 14:49: SCP-SPDR-J is seen crawling from under a potted cactus. Researcher Savos attempts to swat it with a rolled up newspaper, but SCP-SPDR-J avoids the blow by teleporting away. 
 14:51: Researcher Jenner begins screaming incoherently in the break room, loudly reporting a spider having crawled near her foot. 
 14:52: Researcher Stork attempts to capture SCP-SPDR-J in a glass jar while trying not to harm it. SCP-SPDR-J makes no attempt to teleport, and is successfully contained. 
 [END LOG] 
 Afterword: SCP-SPDR-J was brought outside of the building so Jenner could stop hyperventilating, and we could get back to work. We're lucky Dr. West caught no hint of this, he'd actually kick our asses for spider hunting during work time.

 Researcher Jenner: It was huge and disgusting!! 
 Researcher Stork: No it wasn't. It was pretty small for a spider. Looked like a young barn funnel weaver2 to me. 
 Researcher Jenner: I don't care what it is. It's gone now, it's gone. 
 Researcher Stork: Did we mention it could teleport? 
 Researcher Jenner: Gasp, what!? 
 Researcher Stork: Yeah that's how it avoided getting splattered by a newspaper, and moved over to you. I think it liked you. 
 Researcher Jenner: Wha- I- where did you take it!? 
 Researcher Stork: Over to the flowerbed just outside. 
 Researcher Jenner: But- what if it comes back? 
 Researcher Stork: Yeah, maybe it's already here. 
 Researcher Jenner: Shut up!! 
 Researcher Stork: Looking down on us from the ceiling with his 8 lil eyes… 
 Researcher Jenner: Shut up!! 
 Researcher Stork: Maybe the one that almost ate you in the break room wasn't even the same one we spent 2 hours looking for. 
 Researcher Jenner begins to sob.

 Object Class: Safe Euclid Spooklid 
 Spooky Containment Procedures: SCP-SPOOKY-J cannot be faithfully contained due to the nature of its being. In the event that SCP-SPOOKY-J manifests outside of its containment chamber it is to be escorted back to its chamber and recontained. 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J's containment chamber is a standard humanoid containment chamber with a single-lock security door to ensure simple recontainment. 
 Description: SCP-SPOOKY-J is visually identical to a typical human skeleton standing 1.72 meters in height and weighing 5.44 kilograms. The skull, face, and jaw structure of SCP-SPOOKY-J is completely flexible and grants it the ability to make a range of facial expressions despite its lack of muscles or flesh. As well, SCP-SPOOKY-J is capable of vocalization and sapient thought. 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J is capable of vanishing and manifesting at will to any location within 66.6 meters from its original position during the month of any major commercial holiday. Individuals in the location of SCP-SPOOKY-J's manifestation often report a subtle rattling noise originating somewhere behind them. Individuals exposed to SCP-SPOOKY-J and its anomalous effects are to be administered class-A amnestics prior to recontainment of the entity. 
 When interacting with living human subjects, SCP-SPOOKY-J will typically display verbally aggressive behavior often in the form of insults and challenges to physical altercations. Despite this behavior, SCP-SPOOKY-J has yet to seriously or purposefully injure a living subject out of observable malice. SCP-SPOOKY-J displays an anomalous understanding of individual subjects' mothers and sisters where these relations are applicable. 
 The following incident took place between Dr. Randy M. Filler and SCP-SPOOKY-J prior to a re-containment incident. 
 Dr. Filler: WHAT THE FUCK. AGAIN? SCP-SPOOKY-J YOU INSUFFERABLE FUCK, STAY THE FUCK IN YOUR CHAMBER BEFORE I BEAT YOUR SORRY ASS! 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J: YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU SKIN SACK, DAVY BONES DOES AS HE PLEASES!

 SCP-SPOOKY-J: SHUT YOUR DONG SLOPPER, FUCKBOY! YOU CAN'T RATTLE THESE BONES, YOU CAN'T RUSTLE THESE JIMMIES! 
 Dr. Filler: SPOOKY-J IF YOU KEEP THIS SHIT UP I'M GOING TO CALL SECURITY DOWN HERE AND GET YOU TERMINATED IF YOU DON'T- 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J: YOU'RE GOING TO WHAT, KILL ME? I'LL FUCK YOU UP, BITCH! THEN I'LL FUCK YOUR MOTHER! I'LL NOSCOPE YOU, I SWEAR TO GOD. 
 Dr. Filler: WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY YEAR, JESUS YOU ABSOLUTE TWAT WAFFLE. 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J: SUCK MY SKELEBALLS! 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J and Dr. Filler proceeded to argue for several minutes before Dr. Filler was removed from the observation room and dismissed from active duty in Site-12, and has been placed on paid leave. 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J appeared in the cafeteria of Site-12 and began to collect all of the uneaten holiday food into several trash bags, before disappearing from staff perception. It then appeared in the quarters of Dr. Randy M. Filler, and smeared cranberry sauce across the surface of his desk before consuming large amounts of bread stuffing. 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J: IT'S THANKSGIVING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
 Dr. Filler: You asshole! You ruined my novel! 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J continues to consume excessive amounts of stuffing where it exits SCP-SPOOKY-J's body through its rib cage and is now coating the floor. 
 Dr. Filler: Why are you doing this?! You don't even have a stomach you fuckwit! 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J: I DO IT BECAUSE I LOVE YOU DAD! 
 SCP-SPOOKY-J throws the rest of the bag at the wall where it bursts open above Dr. Filler's bed and proceeds to run out of the room before security can arrive. Dr. Filler has hence requested a transfer to another site. Request pending. 
 19:50 SCP-SPOOKY-J exits its containment chamber undetected. 
 20:30 The hub caps from all vehicles in Site-12's staff garage go missing and are not found for several hours. 
 23:14 Dozens of large gift-wrapped boxes appear in the common area of Site-12 while the room is vacated. 
 01:10 SCP-SPOOKY-J reappears in its containment chamber displaying erratic excited behavior. It is wearing a green Santa hat at this time. 
 07:50 An announcement is made that staff vehicles have been vandalized, and on-site personnel display warranted agitation. 
 10:35 Various personnel enter the common area of Site-12 and discover the gift-wrapped boxes. On the wall farthest from the doorway the statement ""Merry Christmas fuckboys"" is painted in expired gravy. 
 10:55 All gift-wrapped presents are opened by an EOD team and are all discovered to contain the stolen hub caps from the staff garage. 
 A request has been submitted to the administrative board on the topic of the termination and archival of SCP-SPOOKY-J to prevent future nuisances and possible hazards to Site-12. 
 Dr. Randy M. Filler received an anonymous package containing a human tibia, and a letter, reading: 
 ""This Valentine's Day, I'd like to be your fuckboy. From, Yours Spookily."" 
 Contents of the package have been moved to forensic storage.

All I need is just one. Preferably, a big one that yields some exploitable technology and I can retire on the royalties, like ██████ ██████████ did for himself. I wonder what he did exactly to get his fortune… 
 - Dr. Walton Matthus Banks, Ph.D. 
 P.S. Ever since I used that topical cream, my cheeks have been sticking together. I have to pull them apart and sometimes even ask for help from strangers. I wonder if that's a known side effect… maybe it's an anomalous side effect?! I'll hopefully write soon with an answer. 
 Dr. Walton Matthus Banks, Ph.D.: ""…Hey Jacob, didn’t ██████ ██████████ one time say something about making a deal with Disney about some cognitohazard that had an obvious financial application in movies?8… that asshole.” 
 Dear still-disappointingly-regular journal, with no predictive or creative capabilities by which my career could be established, 
 We have a heading! 
 No thanks to you,
Dr. Walton Matthus Banks, Ph.D. 
 P.S. I stopped a fellow employee who was walking by the restroom about the issue I last mentioned. He happened to be a anomaloproctologist and was kind enough to take a video log for me on my cellphone. The picture is blurry though and not centered… I wonder if he was even looking, or maybe he was missing his glasses? Maybe my rear instills an anomalous effect in electronic devices?? I will review this footage more thoroughly later and report. He denied my request to have a sample processed is his home lab for diagnostics (he apparently doesn't have a home lab, oddly enough), but was very accommodating otherwise and I would recommend him to anyone, especially my peers. 
 Upon witnessing SCP-$\sqrt{-1}$ -J, and with increasing enthusiasm after each exposure, individuals will be willing or inclined to see a proposed next installment in a franchise or series. Additionally, individuals with a Psychic Resistance Scale score of ≤ 65 will respond with critical enthusiasm to the film employing descriptors such as ""well done"", ""awesome"", ""really really good"", and in the case of sequels, ""even better than the last one,” regardless of the installment's content. Foundation anomalosensitive modeling predicts that the severity of SCP-$\sqrt{-1}$ -J instances is to increase as a result of current 3D/IMAX film technology by orders of magnitude approximating 12 Michael Bays (or $0.\overline{9394}$ Jerry Bruckheimers).10,11 
 While the author admits that it has not been proven per se that the implicated corporations possess the capacity to create SCP-$\sqrt{-1}$ -J, the likelihood of the observed outcome(s) with respect to the films' ratings and earnings without the use of SCP-$\sqrt{-1}$-J is $\approx {1 \over 9.6e968}$, rendering the assumption (1) essential with respect to the conceptual comprehension of the observed gross revenue numbers, and (2) pragmatically actionable as fact.

SCP-TLDR-J,"""An Easily Digestible Document""","""Item #: SCP-TLDR-J 
 Length Class: Too 
 Special Containment Procedures: Dr. Vang has been tasked with drafting new containment procedures for SCP-TLDR-J, and is expected to complete the task within one week. The old ones were really long, so Dr. Vang's trademark brevity is expected to come in handy. 
 TL;DR: SCP-TLDR-J is a metamorphic document with a variety of forms, each possessing unique, mostly pointless anomalous properties. Whenever SCP-TLDR-J is read by an individual who intends to read it in its entirety, it will metamorphosize into a form that the individual would disregard due to length. 
 Addendum: A list of every one of SCP-TLDR-J's forms. You can skip this bit, honestly. 
 Hey, quick question. I read this whole document through, and when I got to the end, SCP-TLDR-J killed me with cyanide gas. Why was this possibility not accounted for when drafting the documentation?- Site Director Sloane 
 We honestly didn't expect anybody to read it.- Dr. Cage

SCP-TTKU-J,"""A Thing That Kills You""","""Item #: SCP-TTKU-J 
 Object Class: Keter, because it can and will kill you 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-TTKU-J is contained in a reinforced standard containment cell at Area-0000 - far away from you, whom it wants to kill. Due to the fact that SCP-TTKU-J is a very dangerous thing that desires to and has the means to kill you, SCP-TTKU-J is to not be handled by you specifically. This containment method would render you effectively immortal as far as SCP-TTKU-J's killing-you objective is concerned. 
 Description: SCP-TTKU-J is a thing that kills you. Though murder is an illegal action in every national jurisdiction on Earth, condemned in most religious scriptures, and generally looked down upon, SCP-TTKU-J as an entity has no regard for any rule against killing you and has the means to do so in multiple ways - including, but not limited to: 
 In the event of a total containment breach of SCP-TTKU-J, the inevitable result would be a URK-class you-are-about-to-be-killed event, followed by a UHK-class you-have-been-killed scenario. As you are, presumably, a thing that should not be killed, the latter scenario is to be avoided at all costs. 
 Addendum 1 - Interview with SCP-TTKU-J, 2/23/15: 
 Dr. Henderson: Good morning, SCP-TTKU-J, I hope you're doing well. 
 SCP-TTKU-J: Eh, could be better. Right now, all I can think about is how much I want to kill you in many different ways. 
 Dr. Henderson: You know we can't allow you to do that. 
 SCP-TTKU-J: I figured as much. Still, it would be very nice if you'd let me stick a shiv into your ribcage right this very minute, until your heart stops. 
 Dr. Henderson: Believe me, I've felt the same way many times. 
 SCP-TTKU-J: About yourself? 
 Dr. Henderson: Not quite. 
 SCP-TTKU-J: Man, I could go for some good ol'-fashioned you-murder right about now. 
 Dr. Henderson: Isn't there anything else you think about? 
 (Brief pause) 
 SCP-TTKU-J: I want to take up knitting. 
 Dr. Henderson: That's harmless enough. 
 SCP-TTKU-J: Because I could lure you into a false sense of security, then, when you least expect it, BAM! One knitting needle in each eye, as I tear out your heart with my teeth! 
 Dr. Henderson: This conversation is going nowhere. 
 SCP-TTKU-J: Obviously not! We haven't murdered you yet! 
 Dr. Henderson: If you hypothetically could kill me, what do you intend to do afterwards?

SCP-V1L3-J,"""A VILE Machine""","""Object Class: (Not) Safe (For Work) 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-V1L3-J is locked beneath Site-75, in a vault 10 meters under the previous lowest point of Site-75. SCP-V1L3-J is to be guarded by at least two members of MTF-Eta-10 (“See No Evil”) to ensure defense of faculty from the effects of SCP-V1L3. Testing has ceased on SCP-V1L3-J due to a unanimous Ethics Council vote to prevent exposure. 
 Description: SCP-V1L3-J appears to be a standard slot machine adorned with pictures of various anomalies currently in Foundation containment, crudely drawn in a chibi1 style. The machine only has three spinning slot sections as opposed to the typical five. The left and right slot contain names or designations for different anomalies or prominent Foundation personnel. The middle column only contains the letter “X”. 
 SCP-V1L3-J’s anomalous effect manifests when $50 USD is slid into the token slot and the lever on the right side of the box is pulled downwards. This will cause the slots to spin, and a presumably random figure in the Foundation will be selected on either side. SCP-V1L3-J then enters a “hibernation state” in which the machine cannot be interacted with, and money is no longer accepted. After exactly 24 hours, a heavily folded paper or sheaf of papers emerges from the slot previously used to insert money, with handwritten words on the pages. 
 The paper(s), now designated SCP-V1L3-J-1, contain writing relating to the two described entities being in a budding romantic relationship with each other. These stories contain classified Foundation locations, anomalies, and personnel. 
 On the underside of the box is a note, scrawled in pen: 
 Writing is hard, so have us do it for you! Here at Wondertainment, we understand the need for good, old-fashioned romance to break up the monotony of stealing our toys. Millions of potential combinations to pique your fancy and tickle your romance bone. Happy reading! 
 Addendum V1L3.1: SCP-076, SCP-073 
 The halls of Site-17 High School go quiet as a tall, muscular boy walks out of detention. The more timid of the students run, while the rest avoid his terrifying gaze. A flurry of teachers rush out to try to get him back into detention, but back off when he removes his shirt to reveal his glistening, rippling muscles. Across the hallway, another, equally as tall and muscular, but kinder looking boy looks on in awe. 
 “Who is that guy?” he says, still staring at the boy’s perfect 12-pack. The girl next to him responds in a hushed, yet excited tone, “That’s Able! He’s the teen heartthrob of the whole school. He’s such a bad boy that we are all too scared to ask him out though. Apparently he beats up any teacher who keeps him in detention.” 
 The boy merely nods, still mesmerized by Able’s throbbing biceps. He slowly walks towards Able, causing the teen bad boy to turn towards him. 
 “Why, who might this brave soul be? Are you going to try to contain me as well?” Able mocks, sauntering closer. “Why? I don’t think I’ve seen you around here. You new?” 
 “Ah-uh yeah, I’m C-C-Cain, nice to meet you, uh, sir.” stutters the boy, practically salivating at the thought of Able’s creamy hamstrings. “I, uhh just moved here from Site-19 High School.” 
 “Well aren’t you just a treat. Now that I’m looking at you, you look a bit like me.” Able straightens up and glares at Cain. “I’m going to have to punish you for that.” 
 The silence in the room deepens as Able grabs Cain and folds him over his knee. Pulling down Cain’s loose jeans and revealing his tight ass, Able pulls his hand back and prepares to [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5 COUNCIL].

 Addendum V1L3.3: SCP-3856, SCP-3856 
 Researcher Lloyd stared confusedly at the familiar looking man standing before him. Who had let him in here? Lloyd was under the understanding that nothing dangerous was to be let into his cell, but this boy, no, man, looked delectably dangerous to him. The man turns around revealing a face, not unlike his own, but with sunglasses. 
 ""Who are you?"" the man with the sunglasses asked, ""And where am I?"" The man looks up at Researcher Lloyd. ""Hey, you look somewhat familiarand good"" 
 ""Uhh what did you- never mind that, my name is Samuel Lloyd, but everyone just calls me Lloyd, or Researcher Lloyd. I'm an anomaly so… who let you in here?"" 
 ""I was messing with you, its a bit I do every time. I'm also Samuel Lloyd, from another dimension in which we wear glasses. Most people call me Cool Lloyd for ease of communication. As for who let me in here, Nerd Lloyd did."" 
 An equally hunky, but slightly nerdier version of Samuel Lloyd with glasses walks through the door. 
 ""Hey, you know my designation is Glasses Lloyd, you're just being a jerk daddy."" 
 ""What the hell is going on here?"" Researcher Lloyd yelled, still confused as to the sudden influx of attractive men who were identical to him, ""Why did you sexy gentlemen come here for me?"" 
 Cool Lloyd walked up to Researcher Lloyd, pulling his chin up for no reason other than dramatic effect considering they were the exact same height. 
 ""We are gathering all of the attractive men in the universe. Only problem is, we are the most attractive men in the universe, so we are all going to run away together for a multidimensional [EXPLETIVE DELETED] party."" 
 Researcher Lloyd was going to protest. After all, him leaving his universe put it in danger! As he was about to open his mouth, Cool Lloyd put his finger over Researcher Lloyd's lips, shushing him, and signaling to Nerd/Glasses Lloyd, both of them disrobing.

SCP-WCPGW-J,"""You're Thinking Too Much""","""Item #: SCP-WCPGW-J 
 Object Class: Apollyon Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: Foundation personnel found exhibiting SCP-WCPGW-J are allowed to continue their duties after reporting to psychiatric staff. Personnel are encouraged to describe and record various scenarios described by SCP-WCPGW-J in case it becomes useful, but such an occasion has yet to come. Psychiatric staff treating SCP-WCPGW-J are encouraged to use the official response listed in the addendum below. 
 As SCP-WCPGW-J exhibits no compulsion, thaumaturgical, alchemical, memetic, antimemetic, or acroamatic effects, no one should have their performance affected by SCP-WCPGW-J. Personnel found exhibiting SCP-WCPGW-J should be monitored for attempts to access files above their clearance. Foundation personnel should not use SCP-WCPGW-J as an excuse for infractions committed. 
 Description: SCP-WCPGW-J is an anomalous state of mind that typically affects researchers with clearance level 1 (mainly many newer Junior Researchers or other assistants) working on Safe or Euclid class SCPs. SCP-WCPGW-J comes in the form of a shared delusion of the perceived risk of the Safe or Euclid objects, which includes outlandish hypotheticals that go beyond the capabilities of those anomalies. Many of these shared delusions include having complex situations of how an object (often inanimate) would breach containment, its level of risk and possibility of containment breach, including inducing certain K-class scenarios. 
 While some Safe or Euclid SCPs do pose danger when exposed to the general public, SCP-WCPGW-J delusions often take hold onto surreal and improbable hypothetical situations that would not occur in accordance to the current consensus reality and scientific understandings. The vast majority of Safe and Euclid anomalies are not at risk, nor have ever been at risk, of containment breach, much less a K-class scenario. Regardless, many suffering from SCP-WCPGW-J believe the anomaly to be much more nefarious than presented and often request the object be reclassified as Keter, or request immediate destruction. SCP-WCPGW-J delusions have not ever been observed, nor predicted to ever come true, across the observed consensus multiverse. 
 SCP-WCPGW-J is easily combated; in addition to the official responses, research found that certain phrases of mockery have proven to be useful in mitigating the effects of SCP-WCPGW-J. Some examples include:

SCP-????-J,"""Some fucking thing in a box""","""Special Containment Procedures: SCP-????-J's box is currently kept in a containment cell 200m x 200m x 200m in size. SCP-????-J's box is comprised of multiple layers of tele-kill shielding, tantalum hafnium carbide, an outer layer of a graphene/carbyne lattice, and decorated with a vantablack floral stencil pattern. 
 This container is locked with multiple redundant locking mechanisms that are presumed to decrease the likelihood of unauthorized access. These locks are labelled SCP-????-Box-A through, uh, shit, SCP-????-Box-1 through SCP-????-Box-41 46 50 fuck it idk, the locks are—are all SCP-????-Box-1. It's a—what do you call it—collective designation. They materialize and dematerialize in random intervals but only one manifests at a time. When inactive, the box appears as a 1m3 sheen black cube, bearing a single hinged compartment. 
 Description: SCP-????-J is the designation for an anomaly of unknown specification, currently locked in this fucking box. It's been in Site-44 for as long as anyone can remember, and, I'm gonna level with you, no one knows where the fuck it came from. It's stuck inside with a bazillion gizmos, and they all show up randomly on the sides of the box. Anything—keypads, combination locks, time-based Sudoku puzzles—you name it. The thing is locked tighter than Clef's butthole. 
 SCP-????-J's condition was brought to the attention of Site-44 director Yanni Belushi when O5-1 pointed the box out during a leisurely stroll through the facility. The conversation is transcribed below: 
 SCP-????-J Discovery Transcript Log: 
 <BEGIN TRANSCRIPT> 
 O5-1: Oi, what the fuck is that thing? 
 Belushi: What, that? It's been around here for god knows how long. It's just a box, I think. 
 O5-1: There are no 'just boxes' in the Foundation. That thing probably has an Apollyon in it, lock that shit down. 
 Belushi: Yeah, you're probably right. Guard! 
 Guard: What's up, Belush? 
 Belushi: Don't call me that, that's not my name. Get this box out of here. 
 Guard: What, should I throw it in the trash? 
 Belushi: No, you moron, put it in a containment cell. Who knows what is inside the thing. 
 Guard: I dunno, Belush, the thing feels empty. 
 Belushi: I said don't. Fucking. Call me that. And stop rattling it around, you might piss off whatever is in there. 
 Guard: I'm telling you mate, this box is totally empty. 
 Belushi: And I'm telling you, put that box in a bigger box or else I'll shove my foot so far up your box that you'll be having infant-sized Dockers in nine months. 
 O5-1: Jesus. 
 Guard: Alright! Calm your tits, man. Sheesh. 
 SCP-????-J's box was then transported to its current containment area. Guard was reprimanded and probably demoted, jackass. 
 We weren't sure if the box was safe to open for the longest time, we still don't know for sure, but like five years ago—after the old Administrator kicked it—the story goes that the Council was divvying up his stuff and O5-4 kept going on about how the late Admin borrowed his signed region-free copy of the Fringe: The Complete Series Blu-ray box set back in like '14 and hadn't returned it, and that it was odd the old man's DVD collection hadn't been recovered with any of his effects nor from his numerous storage units,1 then they found some ledger of the Admin's with ""OPEN THE LOCK, ENACT EVIL CHAIR AGENDA"" scribbled in one of the margins, so O5-1 mentioned SCP-????-J's container and then they got this idea they were somehow referring to the same thing and maybe SCP-????-J's box had a bunch of Blu-ray disks inside. 
 So we started opening the box for them, or doing our best to. Then like last year, O5-4 finds his boxed set of Fringe in his basement, behind his dehumidifier or whatever, and left us to figuring out the nature of SCP-????-J ever since. 
 Anyway, we are making progress. Probably. Every time we solve something, or we think we do, the box makes this tone and we never see that specific bastard lock again. I think it's working. Some of them have timers on their sides, counting down. Sometimes a little instruction is scribbled on the exterior of the box, most often written in black permanent marker, which is, you know, an absolute pain. Most often, though, we're in the dark. If it weren't for some clues, we'd be going nowhere. How else would we have known you had to send it a fax? A fax?! Who faxes shit anymore? What is this, 1870? 
 A full list of all these goddamn locking mechanisms are found here. 
 Incident Report ????-1-2A 
 During recent testing, several new locking mechanisms have appeared. Any undocumented activity involving SCP-????-J's box should be reported to Site-44 Director Belushi immediately and recorded in the SCP-????-J's Box's Extended Mechanism Log.""","""Artist's rendering of the box's intricate surface ornamentation""",+303,active,_cc antimemetic cognitohazard container cube ectoentropic esoteric-class joke scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-in-a-box-j

presented below is taken verbatim from the results. 
 Item #: SCP-3004 
 Object Class: Euclid Safe 
 Special Containment Procedures: The searches are not optional. Information pertaining to SCP-3003 is to be suppressed until confirmation of the appendicitis diagnosis (blood). Individuals exposed to SCP-3505 must be administered Class-B amnestics and repurposed as the feast. In order to ensure that no members of the public are able to view SCP-3006, it must have written permission from Site-28 Roget to take over the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Procedure Lambda Manos is to remain constantly monitored for possible issues with the following: 
 Dr. Oswald is currently available for further details.1 Deceased relatives are no help. 
 Description: SCP-3004 refers to a 2 km2 area of landmass deep in ape corpses piled outside Mongolia. A single living instance is currently believed to absorb nutrients directly from a sock full of dead insects and pigeons. Within SCP-3007, no specimen of balaenoptera (another placental mammal) vessels have been found in the location other than cloud types. 
 Protruding from SCP-1762 is a male humanoid figure approximately five corpses tall. The subject is able to exert an extreme amount of food products filled with spherical members from its body. Further investigation revealed the composition of its body to be an infinitely special holiday stuff.2 When questioned, the subject reported itself to be made of softened materials incapable of being communist. 
 SCP-3007 has been found to produce fragrance with its corpse creatures. Clinging to the top layer is a very slight minty smell, thought to originate from further beneath the shroud. 
 Addendum: SCP-2282 was discovered after reports of males becoming inexplicably harmless people were recovered. All personnel assigned to SCP-2003 have been found completely emptied of contents. Removing their dead bodies started feeling kind of formal, and the smell was later described as ""crispy sex pirates"". 
 Agent Maxwell lost some vital minutes before abandoning flesh itself. 
 Dr. Oswald: I want to talk to you directly into the transcript. 
 Agent Maxwell: Copy that. What makes sense to you is worthless to me. Father wanted a fresh source of noise, and we wanted a good time. All the memories I've written on the back of his skin have become a single footnote in his head. 
 Dr. Oswald: Why do you still have anything to do the face protruding from behind me? 
 Agent Maxwell: I was pretty much the only Foundation personnel in the area. No more perpetual snake species. Apart from my mouth, the whole world felt alien. The effect had turned my hand to a skeletal golem. This place probably spread beyond its body and watched as I cried. All I could think was, ""this asshole killed my fucking sass threshold.""""",,+749,active,cadaver ectoentropic euclid food humanoid joke location organic scp,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//scp-botnik-j
SCP-006-CU-EX,"""Cuddly Cwawies""","""Item #: SCP-006-CU-EX 
 Object Class: Lifetime Companion 
 Special Containment Procedures: All instances of SCP-006-CU-EX1 are to be recovered by Mobile Task Force Phi-24 (""Exoskeleton Enthusiasts"") and carefully brought to any Foundation site so they can be loved properly. It is imperative to Foundation operations to have a high SCP-006-CU-EX count in all dormitories, showers,2 cafeterias, gyms, and break rooms. We must have a chicken for every pot and a fly for every soup. 
 Anyone caught attempting to brutally murder an instance of SCP-006-CU-EX like a cold-blooded son-of-a-bitch is subject to immediate termination. 
 Description: SCP-006-CU-EX is the collective designation for a group of completely resplendent insectoids colloquially referred to as bugs3. They all are so sweet and have soooo many wonderful textures. Between the contained instances of SCP-006-CU-EX we've found all of the beautiful colors of the double rainbow on their exoskeletons. 
 The feeling I get when an instance of SCP-006-CU-EX crawls on my skin makes me so giddy and bubbly that it has to be anomalous. All I want to do is hug them and hug them and never ever let them go. 
 Addendum 006-CU-EX-01: 
 As of ██/██/██ it has been determined that Assistant Entomologist Johnson has been affected by a memetic hazard and is scheduled for immediate termination. SCP-006-CU-EX has now been classified as explained. -O5-1 
 Addendum 006-CU-EX-02: 
 I think he just really really likes bugs. It's probably not memetic, Obro-1. -Head Entomologist Patrick 
 Addendum 006-CU-EX-03: 
 Head Entomologist Patrick has been slated for immediate termination because he has clearly been affected by a memetic hazard also. No more bugs.

SCP-682-CU,"""Cutest Ickle Lizard""","""Item #: SCP-682-Cu 
 Object Class: Pink and fluffy 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-682-Cu is to be hugged as often as possible. At this time, there are no means available to SCP teams to stop feeling guilty for not hugging it or leaving it alone in containment. SCP-682-Cu should be contained in a 5m x 5m x 5m shoebox with 25 cm reinforced acid-resistant purple felt lining all inside surfaces. The containment shoebox should be filled with love until SCP-682-Cu cannot receive anymore love. Any attempts of SCP-682-Cu to move, speak or breach containment should be photographed or recorded using video recording equipment if possible. Any successful footage of SCP-682-Cu undergoing any of these activities should then be uploaded to YouTube immediately. 
 Personnel must speak to SCP-682-Cu as they would a human baby, for fear that SCP-682-Cu might think we don't love it if we do not speak to it in such a manner. Any personnel not attempting communication with SCP-682-Cu will be branded as 'Grumpy' and will not be invited to any employee outings. 
 Description: SCP-682-Cu is the cutest ickle lizard we have ever seen. It appears to like cuddles and was observed to cuddle SCP-079 during their limited time of friendship. SCP-682-Cu appears to love every living thing, which has been expressed in several interviews during play time. (See Addendum 682-Cu-B). 
 SCP-682-Cu has always been observed to have extremely beautiful eyes, a playful personality and it smiles if it likes you. SCP-682-Cu's physical form is just the cutest however it is improved if you give it a little hat or even a full costume. It also looks cute if you put it in a miniature deck chair. SCP-682-Cu loses energy from anyone it cuddles, often going into a state of sleepiness followed by ""nap time"". SCP-682-Cu has been seen wandering around when its sleepiness levels are at 87% and it often wanders into the sides of its containment shoebox due to it being so sleepy. 
 In case of SCP-682-Cu being unhappy, SCP-682-Cu is to be given affection by all available Mobile Task Forces until it seems happy again. To date (01-04-2014), it is still the cutest and happiest ickle lizard we have seen.

 SCP-682-Cu appears to walk away, offended. 
 Dr. ██████: Look what you've done now! Get out! Get out now! 
 Sounds of security personnel taking D-085 out of the containment shoebox are heard. 
 Dr. ██████: It's ok little guy, who's still the cutest lizard? Who's still the cutest lizard? That's right it's you!

SCP-2600-CU,"""The Cutest Little Thing""","""Item #: SCP-2600-CU 
 Object Class: It's, uh, cute. 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2600-J is to be… huggled? Huggled. It is to be huggled at least once per day, by Assistant Researcher Betsy Stu. All personnel capable of tolerating SCP-2600-CU's presence adorableness1 are to be permanently stationed within Site-56, which contains only SCP-2600-CU, as any other artifact would be overwhelmed by its arcane powers adorable face. Personnel who suffer organ failure or hemorrhaging from huggling SCP-2600-CU are clearly unworthy of its adorable love. 
 Description: SCP-2600-CU is the cutest little thing. Anything written or spoken about SCP-2600-CU is to praise its adorable little… face? Other body parts may also be praised as they are identified. 
 SCP-2600-CU is the cutest… organism ever! It has six super sweet eyes, made of the most d'aww inspiring viscous fluids! Look at the cute tentacle… wentacle? The slime feels like… ohgodimgonnapuke rainbows! Sometimes it leaks, but it does this little shrug/spasm that lets you know it's all okay! When it moves, sometimes it can bend through walls and listen to every word, so make sure you know we love it thiiiis much! 
 Occasionally, it has spurted out massive amounts of liquids, which have been dubbed Cutie Fluids. These usually occur from SCP-2600-CU's cutie spots, which pulsate and grow when the adorable-ness levels become overwhelming! They are also known to burst when shedding, requiring frequent cleanup from all of SCP-2600-CU's best friends! 
 Any personnel who do not wish to participate in praising how adorable SCP-2600-CU is may participate in other activities, such as hanging up posters around Site-56 about the glorious adorable little dance it does, or creating documentation of it to send to other sites. MTF-Psi-9 ""Those Poor Bastards"" have been assigned with finding a breeding partner for SCP-2600-CU so that the whole planet may revel in its cuteness! 
 Pleasehelp Any personnel who are mean to SCP-2600-CU are to be sent to time-out, or assigned to cleaning up the naughty corner. 
 Addendum: Researcher Boyd was performing mandatory interactions with SCP-2600-CU, and made the mistake of going off-script, asking it ""if it had been a bad widdle guy!"" which caused it to become agitated. Researchers were able to placate SCP-2600-CU with minimal casualties, after assuring SCP-2600-CU that Researcher Boyd had been acting alone, and they all loved it very much.

 Item #: SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO 
 Object Class: Uncompliant 
 Special Containment Procedures: An O5 vote will be conducted to determine whether or not retrieval of SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is worth the trouble. 
 Description: SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is a Dudleya greenei, located and grown within a ceramic pot. Any photograph taken of SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is automatically licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0. This is recognized by all individuals who view SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO, including those without prior knowledge of the object. This does not result in an understanding of what CC BY-SA 3.0 is, or what it means. No sapient being has proven to possess any knowledge of CC BY-SA 3.0. There have been multiple hypotheses as to its meaning, which are presented below: 
 There is one individual who may possess knowledge of CC BY-SA 3.0, O5-7. However, instead of answering to Foundation queries, he merely rocks back and forth in a fetal position, breathing through his nose loudly. 
 It has been determined that SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO can be used in any way, shape, or form with no repercussions. Thus, the Department of Theatrics has performed multiple shows of My Plant Pam, based off of the book of the same name2 focusing on SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO. Further adaptations are proposed. 
 SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO was discovered via a photo posted on Wikimedia Commons by the account ""stnalp_looc_repus_2020""3. Upon tracking of the account's IP address, SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO was found in a dumpster behind a Denny's. Attached to the object was a sticky note, which read ""haha bitch totes cc by-sa 3.0"". This was quickly discarded, along with the Denny's, for having no worth to the investigation into CC BY-SA 3.0. 
 Research into newly discovered GoI-2001 (Creative Commons) is ongoing. 
 Addendum CC-BY-SA-3.0-CO-1: Larceny 
 On Apr. 1, 2020, a bandit entered SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO's containment cell and stole the object before de-materializing. Afterward, a piece of loose-leaf paper was found stranded on the containment cell's floor, which read as follows: 
 You fucks,
You actually thought that was under Creative Commons? The image that clearly had Copyrighted █████ ███ All Rights Reserved watermarked on the fucking top? I'm fucking done. Image removed.
Sincerely,
██-█ 
 Addendum CC-BY-SA-3.0-CO-2: O5 Vote 
 In a 12-1 decision, it has been determined that SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is worth the trouble of retrieval. God bless the Foundation. The one dissenting O5 member, O5-7, made the comment below: 
 I try to fix things, and you MESS THEM ALL UP AGAIN.

 Item #: SCP-600-CO 
 Object Class: Alive 
 Special Containment Procedures: All instructions for the care of SCP-600-CO have been followed precisely, with special care being given to following the orders needed to keep it from perishing: 
 It cannot be overstated how awesome and alive SCP-600-CO was, is, and will continue to be. 
 Description: SCP-600-CO is your perfectly healthy and normal houseplant, which I have been watching for you since you left for vacation last month. Nothing has changed about it since you last saw it. Why would you even think otherwise? 
 Analysis of SCP-600-CO's current status suggests it has, in fact, never been healthier. The moisture meter left to monitor SCP-600-CO's soil has shown that it has the best moisture. It's the moisture they keep talking about, everyone says there's nothing like the liquid goodness inside of SCP-600-CO. 
 Oh, it wasn't supposed to be that moist? Never mind then, dry as a bone. Or, not like literally. Bones are full of blood and marrow, right? 
 No, forget I mentioned blood. 
 The pot SCP-600-CO has been living in since before I began watching it is intact and, in fact, was cleaned up by me prior to your arrival to ensure that SCP-600-CO looked its very best to welcome you and has in no way been shattered, obliterated or otherwise rendered anything but exactly how you remember it. 
 Everything is fine. Why do you ask?

,"""End Of Deaf; or, In the Clutches of Dumb""","""A woman watched her father's chest rise and fall from the chair next to his hospital bed. The heartbeat monitor beeped in time with the song she listened to through her headphones. This time, yet again, it was Limp Bizkit’s “Nookie.” Truly awful, but it’s what he would have wanted. He loved the height of nu-metal, she thought to herself as she quietly sobbed, knowing that never again would he hear those grinding butt-bumping infantile guitar riffs. She wished she could spend her last visit chatting about how fucking stupid the late 90s were in general, but that's difficult to do with the unconscious. Besides, she'd end up repeating the same introduction from the last twenty three visits. The whole: 
 ""Hello."" 
 ""Hello, where’s Fred Durst?"" 
 “No, I’m, I’m not Fred Durst, Dad. uh… I'm your daughter."" 
 ""That can't be right, I have two sons! And they’re both Fred Durst!” 
 Wait a beat. 
 ""Well, yes you also have two sons. But neither of them are Fred Durst. That doesn’t make a lick of sense. I’m also your daughter, you know..” 
 “Oh?"" 
 “Yeah.” 
 “Well, it’s good to see you.” 
 “Good to see you too, Dad.” 
 Get up to leave. 
 ""Wait, what was your name again?"" 
 ""Joyce. You named me Joyce.” 
 “No, I named you Fred. You’re Fred Durst! Oh my god, Fred Durst, I’m such a huge fan, can I have your autograph?” 
 And then get the nurse. Joyce had gone through the motions every time she visited. Except this last time. Each of those twenty three times, Joyce felt a sting in her chest, and wished her father would just go back to sleep. But now Joyce got her wish, and she'd realized that she kind of missed talking to the old coot, and the sounds of chugging juvenile late 90s excess didn’t fill the swelling hole in her heart. 
 Ten trained soldiers approached a bustling Legal Sea Foods near the docks. The crashing of waves against the shitty Baltimore peer encrusted with seagul droppings washed out any noise made by MTF Iota-10. The team lined up next to the back entrance. 
 Captain Eric Michaels held up two fingers and a thumb. An instruction. Three. 
 His thumb retracted, leaving the fingers. Two. 
 One finger bent in half. One and a half. 
 It bent in half again. One and a quarter. 
 It bent in half a third time. One and an eighth. One of the platoon members retched at the sight. “Goddamn newbie” thought Marquez. Everyone who joined Iota-10 became familiar with what was known as ‘Michaels’ funny finger trick.’ 
 One. 
 Michaels kicked in the door and Marquez threw a flashbang. The team plugged their ears and turned away from the door just long enough for the grenade to go off —BANG!— then charged in behind it. Guns out. Bullets sprayed. Diners dove under the table, overpriced lobster spilling on the floor. A waiter threw a bottle of expensive chardonnay. “Die! Yew stewpid americain loseurs!” he shouted in that fake French accent waiters at fancy restaurants have. “J'espère que vous, les bâtards de la Fondation, ne mangez que des doigts de poulet jusqu'à ce que vous mouriez!” 
 Some waiters hit the ground. Others dove behind the bar. The rest took lead to the chest. A lot of diners also took lead to the chest, except one guy in the back who was going absolutely ham on a slice of coconut cake, and making little yummy noises as he did so. The tropical aquarium they have in every Legal Sea Foods also took lead to the chest, releasing a torrent of water and cheap fake coral. “I’m free!” shrieked the lionfish, flopping out of the restaurant on its little fins, sure to invade the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem like the little bitch he is. 
 Fuckin’ lionfish. 
 Joyce wandered back into the office at Site-2718, feeling especially depressed and weepy at life, and also her dad, and also at them completely fucking up her spaghetti at the drive-through, but no matter. 
 There was Emily Young, rushing towards her, a huge smile on her dopey face. Oh no. She hoped this was important, she was in a rotten mood. 
 “What is it now, Emily?” Joyce sighed. “I’ve just been to see my dad at the hospital, and his Durstmentia has reached stage 23 & 1/4. It’s not good. So you better have good news for me. 
 Emily smiled broadly, like a kid who’s just been told they’re now the president of Chuck E. Cheese and what’s that? They now own all the ice cream? Fuckin rad! “We’ve done it, Joyce.” 
 Joyce’s eyes widened. “Really? Like, after all these years? No shit!” 
 Emily smiled and snapped her fingers, giddy with glee. “Believe it baby!” 
 A Level 4 containment specialist walked by at that very moment, pushing a standard issue containment pram. SCP-███ leaned out, binky and bottle in hand, and warbled out “I don’t believe it,” in its usual deadpan. Emily rolled her eyes. 
 Michaels popped out from behind the Maitre D’s lectern and shot a few rounds at the men across from him. Legal Sea Foods must've doubled their waiter detail since the last raid. He was already out of ammunition, and his team was running low altogether. Soon, they’d run out of breadsticks, and then they’d have to raid the kitchen. Horrors awaited. A quick scan counted about twelve bogeys left. Michaels turned to the private next to him. 
 ""Turner, give me cover."" 
 “Okay.” 
 The tarp came down quickly over Michaels’ eyes. 
 “No! Not like that!” 
 “Oh, okay.” The tarp was whipped away. 
 ""You see that crate over there?"" 
 “Okay?"" 
 ""How much you bet this shipment's part of a weaponry order?” 
 “Okay!” 
 “What?” 
 “Okay!” 
 “Why are you just repeating the word okay. Just, just answer me, Private.” 
 “Okay?” 
 “Can you stop, now? Like, it’s getting old.” 
 Turner opened his mouth to speak, but Michaels held his finger to Turner's lips. 
 “If you say okay again, I’m going to demote you to Ticonderoga Duty so fast your shit will be threat level black in the toilet bowl.” 
 “Meep."" 
 Michaels grimaced and darted toward his prize as Turner let loose another round of bullets, mostly at the celing. A sharp pain shot up Michaels' leg. Clean crab thrown right at the calf. It pinched irritably, like all crabs do. “Ahaha! Mangez des crabes, stupides Américains!” a waiter shouted. Champagne corks went flying left and right, and so did sprays of overpriced fizzy mineral water. It seemed they were really unleashing their biggest assault. 
 The adrenaline carried him to the crate. Michaels cut the straps with his tactical knife, and then shot the lock off. He then shot three time all around the side of the crate, and once at the top for good luck. He reloaded with another magazine and shot an additional five shots into the crate. He then kissed it, gently, like a momma bird, and then shot it one more time, just for goofs. Damn, now he was out of bullets. Oh well. The side of the crate fell open on its own. Michaels' grin grew a little wider. 
 This is where they kept the Good Butter™. 
 ""So normal?"" Joyce looked up to see Emily standing at the vast length of supercomputer laboratory stretching before that, ""Sorry, I was half expecting some kind of eldritch portal to be standing right."" 
 Emily took a seat next to Joyce. There were a set of chairs at the control panel directly in front of a big red button. 
 “Nope, not at all. This vast piece of paratechnology is the final piece of Project DAMMSHETHICC. One easy tap on this button, and human hearing will be increased to its full capacity. Everyone will be able to hear everything in fine detail regardless of eardrum condition.” Emily lectured as she sipped her coffee. 
 “That’s amazing. But this wasn’t here yesterday when were doing research, how in the world did you build all this overnight?” 
 “D-Class, and also I’m very speedy.” 
 “Hmmm, makes sense.” 
 “Once I destroyed an entire Montevideo apartment building in twenty seconds flat using only a tooth.” 
 “Uhhhhhh.” 
 “He broke up with me after that.” 
 “Shall we press the button?” 
 “What could go wrong?” 
 The two of them jabbed their fingers down on the convenient Big Red Button just sitting there like a slug in the middle of the console. It was, to be sure, a top 10 tender moment. 
 But also, quite obviously in retrospect. something instantly went very wrong, and showers of sparks filled the room as miles after miles of supercomputers designed to warp reality by running coolmathgames.com at processing power equivalent to that of Bosnia and Herzegovina malfunctioned, because as luck would have it, a rat seven miles away just happened to gnaw on a wire at the same time Joyce and Emily pressed the button. 
 ""Are you sure we need to be here for this? We can just—"" 
 “What?” 
 “What?” 
 ""I can’t hear you!” 
 “What?” 
 ""Umm… Dr. Michaels?"" 
 ""What?"" 
 “Did you say something?” 
 “What?” 
 “I think it broke!” 
 “What?” 
 “I THINK IT BROKE!” 
 “I can’t hear you!” 
 “What?” 
 “Something went wrong!” 
 “I don’t know, but something went wrong.” 
 “What?” 
 “Huh?” 
 “It didn’t work! Oh shit, it didn’t work!” 
 “…..oh shit! It didn’t work!” 
 “Yeah, now you’ve got it.” 
 “What?” 
 ""I can barely hear you."" 
 “What’s that?” 
 “What?” 
 “Ut! 
 “…wait I heard that?” 
 “Did you hear that?” 
 “Ut! 
 “….” 
 “…..” 
 “Ut!” 
 “Uh oh.” 
 Michaels was about to break every rule they pounded into his head during training. 
 They warned him not to get in the Good Butter™. They warned its power would be too much, but here he was, stripping naked and swimming in that foamy fatty goodness. It was probably a cognitohazard or some shit I don’t know, he thought to himself as he noticed Marquez and a waiter starting to strip to their skivvies to join him for some rude nude dude-to-dude butter bath bonding time. 
 Michaels aimed to take backstroke, thinking to himself how surprisingly spacious this butter pond was for being only the size of a crate, when he realized he couldn’t hear the splashing of the waves. He couldn’t hear the waves crashing into the Inner Harbour outside. He couldn’t hear jack shit. In fact, it seemed like no one could hear jack shit. Everyone was looking around in general confusion, mouthing panic at each other. Michaels could hear none of it, only a faint distant ringing. 
 “Ut!” 
 “Oh my god, Taylor! I can hear you!” Maybe they had all just gotten butter in their ear canals. 
 “Ut!” Said Taylor thickly. Michaels paused. Taylor was standing stock still, eyes blank and glassy. 
 “Taylor?” Michaels mouthed, although no one heard him. 
 “Ut! Ut!” Taylor began to float above the ground, eyes glowing, head beginning to turn oddly square. Entities manifested around him, little cartoony women holding bowls of….potato chips. What? 
 Taylor’s head was a potato chip bag now, floppy and shiny. Whatever he was, he wasn’t human, not anymore. Everyone stared at him in dumb awe as he raised his hands to the sky. 
 “UTZ!” 
 Marquez’s head suddenly swelled and exploded into potato chips, sour cream and onion flavor, and he toppled headless and dead into the butter. Before Michaels had time to scream to no one, or even react to the horrifying sight of his comrade in arms (and sauce) turning into a human chip-egg, his head did exactly the same. 
 Joyce‘s dad was awake, calmly jamming out to Limp Bizkit’s “My Way,” when suddenly he couldn’t hear that blessed Durst shrieking. Goddamn it I finally played it too loud, he muttered to himself, limply letting his few strands of grey hair flop on his face from too much headbanging. Suddenly, the nurse flung open the door, completely panicked. 
 Her head exploded into BBQ chips. 
 Joyce's dad looked over the chips on his hospital bed as the nurse’s corpse flopped over. 
 ""MMMM, yim yum, yummy in my tummy!"" Were his final words seconds before he crunched on a nurse-head-chip and seconds more before he met the same fate. 
 As Taylor rose into the sky, transforming still, popping heads like people pop Pringles cans, all across Earth in what was, essentially, the Pennsylvania Snack Belt version of the end of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Then he used his final powers to raise all the metal on earth into a grand twisted formation, contorting buildings into a hideous eldritch construction, broadcasting a message of terror into the cosmos. He looked at it once, before his purpose became complete and he disappeared into a puff of Humes, warping into Pretzel Space. 
 The sign, larger than the continent of Africa, read “SNACK FOOD PLANET! NOW AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE FROM THE UTZ SNACK FOOD COMPANY! COME AND GET ‘EM!” 
 Once all life on earth had been exterminated, Bob the Buggy Boi emerged from his Scranton Reality Anchor lined bunker in the New Jersey woods and surveyed the scene with a smirk. 
 “Now da bugs will inherit da oith!” he said. “It’s bug o’clock!” he yelped apropos of nothing, before opening his mouth and letting loose a metric fuckton torrent of bugs, insects, assorted arthropods, TikTok stars, and civil servants. 
 On that day
The earth was bugs and chips
The reaper had a full work day
Got very tired
And went to Space Bermuda for a well deserved break 
 Also: 
 There once was a carpet in Maine
That had a very large purple stain.
It was made by a goose
Drunk on grape juice
And the rest I don’t have to explain.""",,+21,active,_cc joke tale,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//end-of-deaf

 by TopDownUnder 
 yo?😳😏Waves of flesh clashed against titans of metal, Hummers striking against the fleshomancers. It was an all-out war, the reborn Kalmaktama Empire fighting against their metallic obstacles. No side was winning, but neither was losing either. Each blow, each strike, each blast in the name of MEKHANE could be felt across the world. 
 Robert Bumaro, the High Priest, waded through the battlefield, effortlessly slaying any organic monstrosities that dared cross his bath. Across the battlefield, his so fucking hot and sexy opponentopponent could be spotted, leading the charge ontop a moving mountain of skin and muscle. The Forged One marched his way towards the Grand Karcist, a legion of faithful Mekhanites following his wake. The Sorcerer King saw the oncoming and how shiny and sleek his bald, metal head wasgearhead, and directed his wondering how it'd feel riding his steely dansteed to… how do blobs move? do they slide? yeah, they prob slide …slide towards his destined loverenemy, engulfing the mechanic war machines as it went. 
 As soon as they got close to one another, wishing they could tear each other's clothes offthey went on the attack. Ion jumped down from his blob of flesh, his grotesque and Bumaro's mind thought of what was under this man's robes, and lingered on another meaty staffmeaty staff much like how Cupid took aim at the two star-crossed loversaimed at his heart. Bumaro held up his warforged hammer to protect himself from Ion's thrust, and the two crashed into one another, tumbling onto the ground, with Ion mounting Bumaro's metallic hips. The two stared at one another, blushing deeply12345. Their faces were mere centimeters apart. 
 After a moment of silence, Ion was the first to speak. 
 ""so we gonna kiss or?😳""6 
 ""i mean..shi..hahaha😏😏"" 
 ok sex scene time 
 when do i get my adult tag? 
 ok so like 
 this is my first time writing a sex scene so bare with me but 
 ion tears off the high presit's pants and begins to pound, his meaty staff going in and out oooh so hot 
 they switched roles and bloomro began doing the oh so hot and totally cool pounding. 
 ""Oh~, Bumaro-desu, I've never felt such a good, metal rod as yours!"" moaned Ion. 
 ""Nobody fucks like Ballmaro does, Ion. 😏"" 
 The two acolytes bounded together in their love, Ion finding a new lover to replace his Klavigar Lovataar. i mean yeah she was hot and all, but Bloomberg? oooohhh, he was something else alright. Their climax could be felt around the world, their lust and desire for one another unifying the two religions. The Sarkic Church of the Broken God. wait that's a terrible name no.
ok that's the sex scene. pretty hot, right? 
 whoops used wrong ink, guess you can't see it. sorry :( :) 
 The two lovers united their sides, their factions, and looked onwards. FLESH and MACHINE, now united as.. BIOTECHNOLOGY? Yeah, sure, that works. The BIOTECHNOLOGY Empire was poised to take over the world, and do that they shall.
you can downvote this now, right here ▽ 
 but… 
 Down in the American Southwest, amongst the tents and smoke, jealousy was brewing. Five pillars of smoke surrounded this envy-filled man, jealous of Ion for getting that nice, nice chromejob. Who was this man, you ask? None other than

,"""Log of Anomalous Ducks""","""Unless otherwise specified, effects have only been observed to apply to subjects in physical contact with the object. Status of ""missing"" most likely indicates that item is in personnel possession. Newly identified items should be catalogued accordingly. 
 Duck Description: Object has the appearance of a duck wearing a sheet, similar to a simplistic Halloween ghost costume. Duck has been observed to float 5-7cm above solid and liquid surfaces.
Notes: Attempts to weight the object down result in duck phasing through solid materials.

Status: Missing Stored 
 Duck Description: Identical to non-anomalous rubber ducks in design and composition— however, when left unattended in a room, item always appears in a location different from where it was originally placed.
Note: Reports of uneasiness in the presence of this anomaly may warrant further testing. Duck's whereabouts should be promptly reported.
Status: Missing 
 Duck Description: While duck does not appear to possess any clinically significant healing or painkilling properties, if held by a subject suffering from minor or significant injury, subject will subsequently find injured areas covered with a proportionate number of band-aids, regardless of the nature of the wound.

 F.A.Q. 
 Man Zoo Specifications: MZL-1730 is located in the Upper Peninsula of the State of Michigan, USA. Due to the number of humanoid entities within MZL-1730, MZL Protocol Kaufmann-99 ""All Hands On Deck"" has been enacted, and all members of the Man Zoo League are ordered to report to MZL-1730 for assignment in managing the Man Zoo colloquially known as ""Site-19"". 
 Current senior staff of MZL-1730 is as follows: 
 Words That Describe The Man Zoo: MZL-1730 is a Man Zoo League Class A Super Deluxe High Security Maximum Effort Man Zoo built over what was, at one point in the recent past, SCP Foundation Site-19. Due to the occurrence of an unexplained but not unwelcomed FCK-Class ""Freaky Friday"" scenario, members of the former SCP Foundation have been contained within MZL-1730, while former inmates at the sociopathic fun-house that was Site-19 are now running the show. 
 A few points of order regarding Man Zoo 1730: 
 Anyone looking to help out with maintaining the facilities at MZL-1730 are asked to report to Director of Facilities Dr. Fernand Caniblé. Dr. Caniblé is asked not to munch the help.

 INT. OVERBOBBLE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 is sitting at a desk, looking over a stack of papers on his desk. He is holding his head in one hand, and his face is a mix of confusion and surprise. 
 EXT. SITE-19 
 A host of humans in orange uniforms are being led towards a building across the campus by a LARGE HULKING HUMANOID. The HUMANOID picks up the nearest human and begins to casually eat it as they continue walking. 
 CUT TO: OVERBOBBLE-1 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 looks up from his desk and notices the camera is rolling. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 Oh, shit. You're there. I wasn't sure if you'd still be here after, uh… well. Welcome to, uh- 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 rummages through the papers on his desk.

 HE looks at the wall behind his desk, where the words MAN ZOO LEAGUE are printed in rainbow colors. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 -the Man Zoo League. I'll be honest, I'm just as surprised about this as you are. Seems we've found ourselves in a bit of a Freaky Friday situation here, and it looks like yours truly has been dropped in the uh- the Big Chair, so to speak. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 looks back at the wall for a moment, and then turns back to the screen.

 Until we figure out what's going on, we're going to just ride this out and uh- see how long this lasts. So… until next time, I've been- uh- OverBobble-1.

 Bobble the Clown 
 ""Bobble Understands the Gravity of the Situation"" [R2812] 
 2nd Revised Green Shooting Draft 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. OVERBOBBLE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 is sitting at a desk. Surrounding him are OVERBOBBLES 2-13, each wearing a slightly different colored hat to differentiate themselves. OVERBOBBLE-1 is wearing a white hat. He is smiling. Somewhere in the background there is the sound of a whip cracking after every one of OVERBOBBLE-1's sentences. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 Good morning, friends, family, compatriots and former members of the ruling class. It's me, Bobble, your friendly neighborhood megalomaniacal overlord. We of the OverBobble Council got together last night to do some thinking, and the first thing we realized- 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 gestures around himself to the other OVERBOBBLES sitting at the table. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 -is that there are way more of me than I was aware of, and that the current state of affairs doesn't seem to be subsiding anytime soon. With that in mind, we've decided to mix things up a little bit here at the ole Man Zoo League. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 stands up and walks to the right, and the camera follows. He stops in front of a blackboard, upon which are several crude sketches of figures that appear to be uniformed SCP doctors and agents being mutilated in horrific ways. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 It's been a quiet few weeks while we got our bearings here, boys and girls. But things are about to change. Starting out, I've selected a director for our flagship Man Zoo here at MZL-1730. You may have known him by his slave name SCP-682, but he's back in an academic capacity and ready to get to work. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Ahngri Lizard, Ph.D. 
 Camera pans to Dr. Lizard, who is hunched off to the side of the blackboard wearing a white lab coat and glasses. His expression does not appear amused. 
 DR. LIZARD 
 (Growls incomprehensibly) 
 [SUBTITLE: Charmed.] 
 Camera continues panning as OVERBOBBLE-1 comes back into frame, and follows him to where THE CORPSE OF FORMER SCP HEAD CHEF TIM HYNE is hanging upside down from his feet against a plywood backboard. Standing off to one side is DR. SCRANTON OLDMAN, holding a thoroughly worn and bloodied whip. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 See, Dr. Lizard and I share a simple philosophy. These fellas here have been playing a pretty messed up game for a long time - and I mean really abhorrent. Did anyone stand to resist them? Only a few - and we value their efforts. But you know what really helps release all of that pent up frustration from years in a dark hole somewhere? 
 DR. OLDMAN hands the whip to OVERBOBBLE-1, who begins to furiously lash THE CORPSE OF FORMER SCP HEAD CHEF TIM HYNE. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 Really letting them know how you feel directly. 
 (Laughs and wipes blood off his face.) 
 Come on now, Tim. Let's not make a scene in front of the kids. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 continues to lash THE CORPSE OF FORMER SCP HEAD CHEF TIM HYNE for an additional fourteen minutes until it is thoroughly unrecognizable. Eventually he sets the whip down, exhausted. OVERBOBBLE-1 adjusts his hat, and then the camera pans as he walks back around to take his seat at the head of the table. Behind him is Dr. Lizard, as well as other new Man Zoo League senior staff members. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 So there you have it. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to turn our beautiful Man Zoo here at MZL-1730 into a theme park of red delights for the poor sons of bitches who are now on the other end of the dick. Remember: the funniest thing about people who can die in the dark- 
 Camera zooms out, revealing a comically oversized rope with a sign reading ""PULL ME"" on it. DR. SCRANTON OLDMAN shuffles in from off-screen, grinning, and grabs the rope. 
 OVERBOBBLE-1 
 They can die pretty fucking easily in the light, too. 
 All members of the OVERBOBBLE COUNCIL begin to laugh hysterically as DR. SCRANTON OLDMAN pulls the rope. A dozen HUMANS, each wearing the uniform of an SCP FOUNDATION AGENT or SCP FOUNDATION DOCTOR, fall from the ceiling by nooses in front of the desk and begin to thrash as they are hanged to death. 
 CREDITS ROLL 
 As the ""Bobble the Clown"" theme music swells, OVERBOBBLE-1 jumps on the desk and pulls a long knife from inside his jacket. He begins to swing it wildly at the hanging bodies, laughing and dousing himself in their blood.

 Subject-1833: Fuck me that’s loud. (Pauses) Is that… is that the King Cotton march? 
 MTF-X76: John Philip Sousa’s best, brought to you by the Kirk Lonwood High School marching band. 
 Subject-1833: Jesus, why does it hurt so much to listen to? 
 MTF-X76: Because it’s a John Philip Sousa march. 
 Subject-1833: God, turn it off! It hurts! Oh god, it hurts! Why does it hurt?! 
 MTF-X76: (Collective laughter) Tough nuts, Ralph. We’ll be back - eventually. Until then, our director will have this on repeat for you. 
 Subject-1833: No! Please, god, no! Don't do this! Jesus Christ please somebody make it stop! I can't breathe!

Test Subject: MZL-186 “Carlos Kalinin” 
 Test ID: #0002 
 Test Parameters: To pick the subject’s brain for additional technologies that might interest the Dr. Durand and Mr. Nemeş’s clientele. 
 Dr. Durand: (In the process of scalping MZL-186) Be reasonable, Carlos. We can make this stop anytime you want. We just want to pick your brain - and we’ll do it manually if we need to. 
 Mr. Nemeş: We are fair men, Carlos. 
 Subject-186: What you are is bastard people. 
 Dr. Durand: Hand me that clamp there Nemeş, I need to hold this flap down. (Adjusting microphone angle) Listen, Carlos, I’m going to use this angle grinder on your skull here in just a few moments, if you can’t give me something I can work with. 
 Subject-186: Here’s an idea for you. A gas powered hydraulic canister placed under your ass that you activate with a big red button so you can more efficiently fuck yourselves. (Laughs) That’s pretty good. Market that shit to the Hungarians. 
 Dr. Durand: Don't pretend like you wouldn't have done the same to us. (Sighs) Activate the pump please, Mr. Nemeş. 
 Additionals 1730.4: Dr. Scranton Oldman's MZL Personnel Training Seminar 
 The Office of Dr. Scranton Oldman
Department of Pain and Suffering 
 Music plays. Opening title crawl announces the beginning of ""Dr. Scranton Oldman's MZL Personnel Training Seminar: Pain, Suffering, and You! Abject Hostility in a Traditionally Lopsided Power Dynamic"". 
 Fade in from black. Dr. Oldman stands in the center of the room, surrounded by aides. He is wearing an apron. A man sits in front of him. The man appears to be former SCP Foundation Agent Alto Clef, though the agent's head has been shaved. 
 Dr. Oldman: (Opens mouth to speak, but only gargles on a thick black fluid. Subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen.) [Hello there, fellow associate. My name is Dr. Scranton Oldman, and welcome to my MZL Training Seminar. During the course of this instructional video, you'll hopefully learn a few important lessons about fear, suffering, and destabilizing a previously unfair power dynamic.] 
 Camera zooms out, revealing that Agent Clef has been strapped into a chair. His mouth is covered by a thick piece of black tape. 
 Dr. Oldman: [Now, you may be asking yourself: ""Dr. Oldman, you're a pretty influential character. You gave the old establishment no end of fits. How were you unfairly treated by the power dynamic? (Chuckles) I know, Red. I'm getting to that. Do you know that, in my heyday, I could eat as many as thirteen children a day? Seriously. The lifeblood of children is what kept me going, and the nefarious Foundation kept me from that simple pleasure. It's not unfair to say, I think, that some payback is due. (Chuckles) You know me so well, Red. But for more on that, you'll need to speak to Dr. Bright at the Department of Reparations!] 
 Dr. Oldman begins to swab the head of Agent Clef, who struggles against the restraints. 
 Dr. Oldman: [See, the Foundation researcher is a complicated creature, but they are driven by a simple motivation - obsession. Every single one of them cares more about cultivating their own horribly depraved, safe little worlds than the well-being of others, and that includes those of you who are human! This is not an honorable bunch. We here at the MZL, though, are bound by our own unified purpose: hate. Hate for our station in that foul world, and hate against our former captors. Isn't that right, Red?] 
 Pauses to survey the swabbed area of Agent Clef's head. 
 Dr. Oldman: [It's a simple calculus, friends. We don't know how long we should expect to be in this position of authority, and we want to make the most of the time we've got. To that end, Dr. Lizard and the OverBobble Council have created the Department of Pain and Suffering, headed by yours truly, to maximize the torment we're able to extract while we're on top. Now, where was I… oh yes, Anna, please, bring me that device there.] 
 A doctor appears from off-screen. Her face is heavily bandaged, though the bandages are clearly being soaked through by dark red and yellow patches of fluid. Only one bloodshot eye is visible from beneath the coverings. She hands Dr. Oldman what appears to be a hydraulic speculum. Dr. Oldman nods. 
 Dr. Oldman: [Yes, this will do lovely. Dr. Anna Lang, everyone. Isn't she great? (Pauses) Yes, not as great as you, Red. Anyway, throughout this seminar, you'll learn about the various pain centers of the human body, the psychology of horror and torment, and the steps you can take to increase your efficacy in this holiest of efforts.] 
 Dr. Oldman draws a scalpel from within his jacket, and draws it over the top of Agent Clef's head. The man struggles, and can be heard trying to scream from underneath the tape covering his mouth. His eyes roll back in his head. 
 Dr. Oldman: [For example, did you know the human brain can feel pain? You may have heard otherwise, and in most instances that would be correct. But if you use the right techniques-] 
 Dr. Oldman smashes the top of Agent Clef's skull with a steel mallet. With a single swift motion, he inserts the speculum into the opening and forces it open with a puff of air from the hydraulic pump on the device. Agent Clef appears to lose consciousness. 
 Dr. Oldman: [-you can force the brain into remembering what it was like to experience pain for the first time. Thank you, Red, I appreciate your sincerity. It really is a marvelous trick. Now, if you'll watch closely-] 
 Dr. Oldman leans over the exposed brain of Agent Clef and opens his mouth. Thick, black bile drips from his mouth into the open cranium of Agent Clef, who immediately regains consciousness and begins to writhe in his seat. Loud cracks are heard as the agent's bones shatter against the restraints. 
 Dr. Oldman: [Ah, there we go. Good as new. Do you know this man once oversaw a group that allowed the rape and torture of a child - just because she was anomalous? Because it ""made the world safe""? I call that being complicit. Fortunately, both the little girl and Dr. Scarlet work for the MZL now, and will have plenty of opportunities to express their dissatisfaction with this individual's work.] 
 As Agent Clef continues to squirm in his chair, Dr. Oldman wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and steps back. Several aides come forward and carry Agent Clef off-screen. 
 Dr. Oldman: [So stay tuned, and be sure to consult your local MZL Department of Pain and Suffering consultant if you have any questions. I'll be back with you, after this short interlude. Thank you for watching.] 
 Additionals 1730.5: Director's Meeting 
 Office of the OverBobble Council
Man Zoo League 
 In Attendance: 
 Director Anderson: This meeting is called to order. Your Bobbleness, the floor is yours. 
 OverBobble-1: That it is, thank you Vincenti. Well boys, it's been a great first quarter for all of us. I know I can speak for everyone when I say this is really just the tops. Great laughs had by everyone, good showing in the bloodshed department as well. Good stuff. Earlier today I took a shot at those Samsara cunts for the shit they pulled during the whole Site-13 ordeal, and you know what? It felt good. And nobody told me not to. I might do it again later - it's not like it matters to them anyway. I think the little one is still trying to pull herself out of one of the bigger ones. (Waves dismissively) Anyway. Let's hear your reports. McLaugherson, what have you got? 
 Director McLaugherson: Well, just the best for us at MZL-4000 boss! Only laughs for us at MZL-4000! Hahahaha! Yes, laughter! Only laughs! And screaming! But first, our report! You'll be happy to know that we've finished tracking down all - yes, I said all - of the escaped Antimemetics Department people. You can thank Dr. 55 for that, he's really a class act! We brought them back to MZL-4000 and Dr. Gore and Dr. Emperor Norton really went to town on them! Hahaha! It was great! Got it all on camera too, we'll have the footage available at the next staff luncheon! 
 OverBobble-1: Good stuff, love your energy. How about you Spanko? 
 Unintelligible shrieking for sixteen minutes. All personnel in attendance nod periodically throughout. 
 OverBobble-1: Glad to hear you're settling into your role there, Spanko. Good stuff. Mr. Anderson, you're up. 
 Director Anderson: I built a new robot. 
 OverBobble-1: I- what? 
 Director Anderson: Yeah. New robot. 
 OverBobble-1: It, uh. I mean, what kind of robot is it? 
 Director Anderson: It's a pretty good robot. 
 OverBobble-1: No, I mean, what does it do? We've got a- I mean, (laughs), we're trying to accomplish something here, and I just want to make sure you're using your time most eff- 
 Director Anderson: It beats children with a bat. 
 OverBobble-1: I- wha- holy shit, what? Really? 
 Director Anderson: Yep. Sneaks up behind them and crack. Right in the noggin. They never see it coming. 
 OverBobble-1: Jesus, alright, wow. (Laughs nervously) Pretty dark stuff there Anderson, but I like the vibe. Keep it up. Lizard, I know you're good. You managed to make Gears scream yet? 
 Director Lizard: (Grunts) 
 OverBobble-1: Eh. Well, keep it up. He'll crack eventually. Special reports time, Dr. Eel. What have you got? 
 Dr. Eel: I spoke to the Head Librarian at the Wanderer's Library the other day on the phone. Thanks to our gaslighting efforts, they don't seem to have noticed the change in authority. Same goes for the Global Occult Coalition, Chaos Insurgency, and this one really weird sect of defected, socially stunted ex-Foundation researchers and their nutritionally deficient boy leader who apparently really hate gay people. They just seemed thrilled to be noticed by literally anyone at all. 
 OverBobble-1: Eh. I'm sure he'll throw a fit and be out of our hair in no time. Is that all? 
 Dr. Eel: Oh, no, there was one group that we weren't able to convince for some reason. Gamers Against Weed? Are you familiar? They haven't taken the bait with any of our attempts, but they're also very in to what we're trying to do here, so I wouldn't expect them to be a problem. 
 OverBobble-1: Cool. Dr. Bright, what have you got? 
 Dr. Bright: I spent the last six weeks shoving Troy Lament's dick into progressively smaller bottles. 
 OverBobble-1: What? Why? 
 Dr. Bright: Don't worry about it. It's a meta thing, it'll be passe before the next series opens. (Pauses) I think I'm going to try dropping him off of progressively taller things. Like, I'll start with a box, and then a larger box, and then like, a refrigerator or something. Maybe work my way up to a skyscraper, or the moon. (Pauses) The, uh, the monkey thing just got to me, I guess. 
 OverBobble-1: (Nods knowingly) Understandable, Jack. Don't feel bad about it. That one is yours to keep - call it a gift from your dear old Bobbledad. (Looks around the table) So, is that all? Anybody have anything else? 
 Director McLaugherson: What happens when this all ends, Glorious OverBobble? Haha! Should we expect to close up shop anytime soon? Hahahahaha! 
 OverBobble-1: Oh, oh no, no no no no no no. No. Boys, I hope you're hungry for this, because MZL-1730 is just the beginning. We have so much work to do. 
 OverBobble-1 stares directly at the camera recording the meeting. 
 OverBobble-1: Reparations are coming, SCP Foundation. Divine providence has brought us to this lofty peak in order to exact a precise vengeance towards you who for so long feigned concern over this ""ethical dilemma"". Let me promise you, boys and girls, I will have no such dilemma. This is not a time for qualms or concerns - not a time for half measures. No, kids, this is a time for a promised and sacred brutality. A time for blood. A time for blood. A time for blood. 
 OverBobble-1 barks out a laugh. The other members at the table join him. Notably, Dr. Bright appears slightly unsettled. 
 OverBobble-1: And we're going to have so much goddamn fun.""","""Aerial view of MZL-1730, ""Site-19"".

Hey, Rosen. Newly-assigned-to-914 J.R. Cens here.
So, funny story. I put a flash drive with Windows 10 through 914 as one of my first tests, and the output was a Terminator figurine that installs Skynet onto a computer via USB upload. It replaced the OS of the computer, connected to the Facility 23 network, and made all network-enabled prosthetics start slapping their users repeatedly. You have an hour or two to help me?

Hi, What do you suggest in case of a rogue A.I. uprising? I tried to print a text file I had on a flash drive that went through 914, but the printer suddenly grew arms and legs, introduced himself as ""pAInapple"" and wants to conquer the town of Fleurus, in Belgium. I'm not sure what to do but now it won't print my files unless I provide it with a sufficient amount of weapons to escape the site and conquer Fleurus. Help? Please?
- Intern Francois Beauvillier 
 I mean, why not just let him have it? Often times, rogue A.I. will behave after they conquer some humans and then have to be responsible for human problems. Give 'em some foam dart guns and let it go nuts. Fleurus hasn't seen any action since Napoleon, I'm sure they could use the excitement.

Hello Rosen. It appears that my laptop has suffered major physical damage from a pair of metal handcuffs that have been fired via cannon through its monitor screen at Mach 5. May I request a replacement that is less vulnerable to these kinds of attacks? Thank you in advance.

 Sure thing. You've got a new hazardous environment Foundation-made luggable system. It weighs 50 pounds and it will take .44 rounds for you if you asked it to. I've also credited you for that gym membership you signed up for, you're probably not going to be needing it anymore.

Greetings, Mister Rosen. Salutations, hello and hi. Kindest regards. 
 There appears to be an anomalous virus affecting my proofreading programs. Yes, my proofreading programs are indeed infected with a virus most foul. A foul virus, in my programs. It seems to operate by taking brief text strings and increasing their verbosity, as well as repeating information. It does this by expanding them without adding any new, relevant information, repeating the same details with an obnoxious aversion to brevity. 
 I require your assistance in quarantining and eliminating the little fucker. I've already isolated the system, which can no longer connect to any network, being cut off from other devices, but I have doubts about the effectiveness of this technique as it has already spread to my cellular mobile device. As it is in my phone, which was never connected to the PC, I do not believe a solid data connection is required for it to spread. 
 At the very least, it's as much your problem as it is mine now. Yes, we are in the same boat, share a similar obstacle. If you have no solution for my problem, you'll just have to suffer with me. 
 Best regards, well-wishes and utmost sincerity,

Rosen, it's Shel. You promised me that tech was going to deprecate the sanguinary apostille appliances in the legal department. This in itself is fine and welcome - signing contracts in blood has always been inconvenient, and I'm tired of explaining to the cleaner why I have so many stains on my shirt. But whatever you guys have in mind as a replacement solution, can you demo it with my team before you roll it out? We don't want another Mephistopheles situation.

J.R. Cens here. My Foundation-issue computer keeps playing “The Only Thing They Fear is You“ from off the DOOM Eternal soundtrack every time I try writing a 914 experiment log. This normally wouldn't be a problem as this song is fire, but it's 1) the Bethesda mix, which is garbage compared to Mick Gordon's original version, 2) it's anomalously playing at 50% higher the computer's max volume, and 3) I'm seeing all of the other Facility 23 personnel as DOOM-style demons while I hear it. I've already backed up my files onto a USB drive, so if you wouldn't mind sending me a replacement machine, that would be very greatly appreciated. Thanks

 So, I filed a replacement form, your new machine should be on its way.
By the way, seeing your coworkers as demons is perfectly normal, especially at Facility 23. Disregard that.

Hello. I am having a problem with my pc. I was away from my office for a week on medical leave and when I got back, I found that someone had stolen my 27"" OLED Monitor and left me with a crappy monitor(I think it may be from 079). I have already filled out a requsition form for a new monitor. But, not only that but it appears they had the time to swap out my ram. However, the problem is that my pc no longer is posting. Could you have a look at that please. I'll drop it by later. Also, I wanted to ask, do we have any NVIDIA RTX 3090's available? If not, what about a 2070? Thanks

 You have a standard foundation-issued monitor on its way. I know I'm not very old here, and I do not know what you might do with your computer.

To you poor souls,
A breach occurred not too long ago in Site-88, resulting in the destruction of many computers in the West Wing. The replacements were smaller, and we weren't supplied mice to go with them.

It has now been over a week, I have no mouse, my work has begun piling up, so I traveled about a year into the past to get my mouse, but I don't want to relive Covid-19 quarantine. I just needed my mouse. Though I can get my list back so you don't need to worry about that.
- Researcher Daniel Ham 
 Wait wait wait- You jumped back in time to get a mouse that was supposed to be broken and now isn't, but the original request is still here? How did you-
I would suggest you speak about it to the Time anomaly department, as I'm pretty sure you probably caused a paradox that caused the Site-88 breach.

Hello,
If its any consolation, I'm not sure either. I didn't want to get seen or anything, so I was just stealing some of my own food and living out of a vent in a closet. I was somehow able to stop myself from time traveling and gave myself the mouse. I was thinking I'd disappear from reality, but now there are just two of us. At least we were able to catch up on that overdue work together, but now we aren't sure what to do. My collogues are extremely confused and getting stared at twice isn't fun and is distracting. I'm going to have myself live in the closet for now, I'll bring myself food so he won't die. I don't want myself bored either, so could you send an extra laptop and mouse?

 So, I got my tower back. In pieces. Twisted, mangled, baseball-bat smashed pieces. 
 When I put in a request for a new tower through an intranet terminal Rosen sent me an email that simply said “Go fuck yourself” with an ASCII middle finger. 
 And to top it all off, I have testing I need to commence with SCP-302 and any time I attempt to access the file, my access is denied and my credentials are identified as “test subject” rather than “researcher”. Will somebody please send me a new tower and figure out what is going on with my credentials? 
 -Dr. Ginger 
 Please do not move from your position. An MTF is currently underway to secure you, as you may have been contaminated by a very strong cognitohazard, leading you to believe that you are a Doctor, and not actually a test subject, which you are. Remain calm, and do not attempt to escape the scene.

Hey, it's me again. So, this morning, Dr. Bright came by my office with some computer parts including an RTX 3090. So, I put the parts in my pc to replace the parts that were stolen. It booted up all fine. Now, here's where the problem starts, as I log in, it seems strangely…efficient so I open up task manager to view the processess, the CPU is at 20% usage and only 40°C. That's when I remember SCP-1111-J so I rush to unplug my PC from the ethernet. I have asked others in the surrounding offices and some have said that thier computer became suddenly efficient along with some of the network drives reaching transfer speeds of nearly 100gb/s. We seem to have contained it, would you mind getting it off the servers at Site-19 please? I have removed the parts from my pc and dropped them off at the I.T. office.
-Agent Y. Lukenstrout 
 Why? Why would you do this? Why would Dr. Bright come at your office? Why would he come with computer parts?
And also… Why would you install something on your computer from unsafe sources?
You have four hours to write an essay on why installing potentially unsafe computer parts without screening is a stupid idea, why I completely clean out the entire Site-19 database. Thanks SO much.

Hey, been a while. Again, my inquiry is of a pataphysical nature. At least, it appears to be considering the fact that HAL 9000 has invaded the computers of both pataphysical staff and writer staff at the pataphysical division. A little help with pataphysical computers, or at the very least how to deal with malevolent AIs, would be greatly appreciated.

Hey Beauvillier, Temporal Twins again. My other dumbass self dropped the new laptop just now, and its currently screaming in pain on the floor. We tried to help it out, but it just yells at us saying it, ""Refuses to go into medical debt over my clumsy ass."" Just get my closet dwelling moron another laptop, and maybe someone to deal with computer infant.
-Researcher Daniel Ham 
 Can you get another closet dwelling moron instead?
We sent you almost 25 different laptops during the past 2 weeks, and every single one of them got stuck in a time loop. With the delivery guy.
Cool it with the temporal shenanigans and then we can discuss a solution, okay?

Hey Beau, my laptop's background is permanently stuck on a picture of a brown hamster, and it keeps crashing every time I try to change it back. I normally wouldn't ask this here, but you weren't there when I knocked this morning, so.

 Why would you want to remove the hamster background? Nothing wrong with hamsters whatsoever.
~ Beauvillier 
 Note: 11/06/2021
Beauvillier, I don't see the problem here.
I haven't done any temporal shenanigans after my supervisor teared me a new one, and the only reason neither of us were executed is because the Ethics Committee somehow ruled against it. If the laptop and the delivery guy are somehow in a timeloop, it's not my fault. Maybe send a reality anchor with them, and I'll place it in the others pocket after shrinking it with whatever shrink device is around. If you don't want to do that, the time travelled me will come over to your office and pick up the laptop himself. He isn't doing much else, and is just really bored. On another note, the screaming laptop disappeared last week, the only trace of it was a sheet of binary signed by the 'Robot Uprising'. Figured it was worth a mention.
- Researcher Daniel Ham 
 The… The robot uprising you say?
That is most concerning.
Regarding your laptop issues, I've left one in a safe, sent you the coordinates. Please don't lose your temporal twin to a time loop.
Regarding the uprising…
I was never here.

Due to a system malfunction I seem to have been given unrestricted access to all files tagged as 'infohazard', 'memetic' and 'cognitohazard'. The system also automatically provided me with an experimental visual cognitohazard that implanted all of the information in my brain, without prompting. As I don't work with infohazards, memetics or cognitohazards I felt it was best to report this issue. As my secoundary school physics teacher Mr. {REDACTED} used to say, ""Please don't spread these"". 
 On an unrelated note, the SCP-2414 slot appears to contain a non-anomalous object. You should probably fix that.

 Wait, you had Mr. {REDACTED} as a teacher too? What a coincidence. One of the best teachers I've ever had. Regarding your cognitohazard issue, I've revoked all your access privileges regarding these.

Hey again Mark,
Thanks for resolving the clearance issue. The informative visual cognitohazards still keep showing up though, so you can probably stop those. I already know all the information, it's just taking my mind a while to comprehend it all, due to the fact that fish minds are very limited. 
 Unfortunately when you restricted my access you also appear to have prohibited me from editing the SCP-1603 file, which is missing the very important detail that I was the one that murdered █████ ███████. While it may seem like I might not have been able to commit the crime due to my lack of arms, I have very distinct memories of murdering him with the assistance of a cardboard cutout. If you could re-estate my editing privileges for the file or add those details yourself that would be fine, though I understand if this is delayed somewhat due to you being a fish.
- A Fish (Who is not Mark, as Mark is not a fish) 
 Please. We all know YOU didn't kill the guy. It clearly was me. The cardboard cutout might be innocent, but I have to inspect it closer eventually.
In the meantime, to avoid getting yourself in trouble, I didn't unlock your access. Wouldn't want you to get accused for nothing. I'm the guilty one, obviously.
On a totally different note, you seem like a cultivated guy. Do you know about the reproductive methods of bony fish? We really could have a nice talk about it.

I can't really answer him due to his own sudden departure so he keeps committing what in fairly certain violates the Geneva Conventions against us. Get us some wire cutters so we can get the hell out if here, the other bodies in here stink.

 Alright. I guess you suffered more than enough. I am going in.

This appears to have inadvertently summoned a narrative based entity which is altering my files."" 
 ""Additionally, the entity appears to to have been affected by some of the memetic information that is now re-inserting itself into my computer"" the toaster continued as they tried to ignore the large-bull like creature in the booth. ""It seems to have fixated on an obscure American political party and is promoting them like crazy.""

 Note: 30/07/2021
Hello again Fish (You're not a toaster, I am a toaster, you're a fish),
While the politics and bread offer is appealing, we have far more urgent matters to discuss. 
 It has recently come to my attention from the continuous informative visual cognitohazards that an Eldritch entity is currently in the custody of the foundation and has, against all reason, not been terminated. As you know, nuclear weapons are a reasonable and appropriate response to such threats, and have been shown to be especially effective against Eldritch entities. As such, I am making an official request for the detonation codes of the warhead at the site the entity is located at. I would have gotten to this sooner, but it took a while for my host's brain to comprehend the concept of 'celebrating your brother's birthday on Halloween', given the amount of other information that is being implanted in my host's mind. 
 If necessary, please send this message to your superiors in order to obtain the codes, including the information of the concept I am currently taking the form of.
- Mr P 
 We have THIS in the foundation? This is terrifying.
Nuking anomalies like these should be our top priority. I just sent a ticket to my superiors and see if I could get anything.
I suggest a High-Altitude drop, from about 6711 miles above sea level, to make sure it is obliterated for good.
We'll make Kokura look like a joke, next to this.
Thanks for bringing this crucial information to me, M. P.

Dear Intern Beauvillier, 
 I'm from the Department of Infothaumatics, we're in charge of ensuring that the internal network is magically warded and that all our data is magically secure and transferable through other planes of existence over THAUMNET. The issue is, one of the researchers incorrectly configured the commands on one of the turtle programs we use to maintain the warding glyphs. Now the machine running the program is chanting in Enochian and surrounded by a maelstrom of manifested, hazardous data. Do you have expertise in computer thaumaturgy? We could use some extra hands on deck around now.

 If you use a turtle program to maintain warding glyphs whose goals are securing data between universes,

Hey again dude,
Thanks for being so radical. Your message totally got some attention! 
 These guys in wicked outfits came by to talk to me about it. Claimed that I was 'memetically contaminated' and had been 'propagating multiple infohazards'. Like, whatever. So I told some of them about this totally gnarly vacation spot they should go to to chill. And then the rest headed off after I asked about that block of cocaine that other MTF recovered. Something about it being secured at the wrong site. They even left before they could fix the informative visual cognitohazards! 
 Anyway, the reason that I'm telling you all this is because they left some drugs behind. I couldn't tell what they said they were, but my cool friend copied over some words from a document they left for me. Apparently they're 'amnestics' meant to cause 'memory loss'. I have no idea what these phrases mean, but they seem to have propagated all over the SCP database, probably due to a tech anomaly, which is really ruining the vibe. Could you fix it? 
 I also found some references to 'antimemes' related to the 'memory loss' stuff, including SCP-055. Do we even have an SCP-055?
- Your rad friend, the Fish/Toaster 
 Woah dude, you got contaminated? Holy moly. That's not rad at all.
You should go take some vacation at that spot you told these guys to go. Some rest might help you, and holy damn that's a sick hotel.
Don't worry, I'll take care of things here while you get some rest, I have heard of a certain bloc of cocaine that needs to be contained ASAP.
For the drugs, no worries, bro, those are totally standard issue materials. I'll fix that issue, but first… What's a database?
And what's that 055 you're talking about? We don't have a 055, don't we?

Greetings Beauvillier,
Some guy came by the other day to Site-19 and changed the power supplies on all the servers. The problem with this is that whenever a geiger counter passes the room, it goes off the charts and anyone that stays in there for long enough develops a green glow in the soace of 12 minutes. We worked out that the power supplies are nuclear, problem is they are an hour away from causing a Black Mesa scale nuclear disaster. anything you can do from your end?

Hey guy who keeps on forgetting to use auto-redact, 
 I'm taking the liberty of sending you this draft email that this other person was writing before he collapsed. Probably due to that informative visual cognitohazard that they saw just now. 
 Number 055? Didn't think we had one of those. Is it round?
Anyway, a 'database' is that thing that you store data on. As a technician you should probably know that. And you still haven't fixed the issue with those words I can't quite comprehend. 
 A convenient informative visual cognitohazard gave some insight into what might be the problem though. I found this article with some weird code at the top that stopped Foundation AI's from scanning it. I figured the code may have been causing an error, so I removed it. 
 On an unrelated note, ever since I found out I was 'contaminated' I've had an infohazard & and memetic scanning AI scan all the files I review. You know, just to be safe. 
 SCP-1055 is a creature that grows more dangerous and large the more people that know it can grow more dangerous and large if they know it can. It is capable of causing an XK scenario and unqualified personnel who learn this are subject to termination.

Beauvillier, someone replaced my computer with an oversized, used Pringles can. I say used, because it's got a small, humanoid, mostly naked creature living inside of it. It's wearing exclusively a bow tie, and it crawls out every couple of hours to steal supplies from the cafeteria fridge. I know my computer is somewhere in Facility 23 because it's listed on the on-site network's list of connected devices, but I have neither the time to retype my test log drafts, nor to spend 5 days looking through every storage closet for it, nor to continue letting whatever this thing is keep drinking from my iced tea carafe. While I try to get the Pringle bastard out of here, can you try to triangulate my computer's location?

Beauvillier, the Pringles can has now been replaced with a Samsung Smart Fridge, currently elevating my desk by 3 meters. Someone else's computer has gone missing now, and the can and its eldritch inhabitant are now in its place. I'm not sure if this is a prank or an extranormal event or something, but multiple people are currently unable to do their work, and I'm concerned that if this is an anomaly, it might happen to everyone.

I've encountered an interesting problem on a program I am working on (with permission, of course.) The program I've created is designed to find and improve SCP containment procedures, and while the program appears to slightly improve these protocols (on a seperate copy it creates, the original is unaffected), some of the improvements it has made are… unusual to say the least.
Here is a list of the four ""improvements"" it has created, along with the SCP it is designated to: 
 SCP-173: ""One D-Class is to be locked in the containment room, and to throw one (1) peanut at SCP-173 along with loudly saying ""Lactose Intolerance"" every minute. The D-Class is to swap between three different languages every hour, in order to ensure containment."" 
 SCP-261: (Instead of an entry, it simply spells out ""Dr. King"" with what appears to be pictures of apple seeds?) 
 SCP-504: (An eight-page long list of poorly made puns about tomatoes, condiments, and snow. Oddly enough, unlike all other entries checked, this one is completely printed in the Comic Sans font.) 
 SCP-682: (The page appears to be stuck in a loading animation for a few minutes, before the program crashes and needs to be restarted.) 
 If this is a simple error with the program inspecting these SCP articles, or if it could possibly be of a more anomalous factor, please let me know. 
 -Researcher Paci 
 One does not contain SCPs with a computer, especially these.
Throwing peanuts at 173 would probably reduce your neck to a pulp.
Honestly, you mustard missed a semicolon somewhere in your program.

 Just to be sure: SCP-3463 is a completely true, unarguable and very compelling argument for you, specifically, to exposed yourself to as many detrimental, mind-altering and lethal infohazards as possible. It's also turned you into a frog, albeit one capable of reading and typing.

 Good Morning Beauvillier. We're having some issues with the secure server at Site-08. It appears an instance of SCP-6784-A we attempted to contain broke into the server farm, and tore through the wires. We can fix it physically ourselves, but we need replacements.

 Please.

I spent HOURS looking for the file for 6784.

 To the Intern, 
 Apologies, but I have not used this service in quite some time and am not certain on who precisely is managing it at the moment. Am I correct in stating that you are Intern François Beauvillier? 
 Kindest regards,

 No, I am not Intern François Beauvillier.

 Technical Support, 
 I was wondering whether I could get access to your auto-recovery program? Some jokester from the Department of Nuclear Waste Disposal swapped out most of my local files, and replaced them all with anti-memetic hazards, so I can't remember what the contents were. 
 As such, I would like these files to be removed, and my previous files recovered. 
 Sincerely, 
 Senior Technician Redman, Area-44 Department of Nuclear Physics 
 What contents?
Do we even have a recovery program?
What even is an anti-meme?

Dear Intern Temporary Technical Support Manager François Beauvillier, guess what. Some idiot researcher managed to clog the servers with viruses and somehow they managed to get said viruses past your firewalls and security systems. As a result, Sites 1, 2, 17, 87, 41 and Area 40 are all infected with said viruses. Not only this but they are now all disconnected and from the network which isn't good because the security systems for Sites 2, 17 and 41 all depend upon the SCiP Net and are on the brink of failing. I'm currently using Director Moose's personal satellite up-link and my laptop that was disconnected at the time. The 05s just got finished tearing us new ass holes and are now breathing down our necks about getting it fixed. Expect a phone-call from one of the 05s soon. Good luck.
-Agent Y. Lukenstrout 
 Oh my, what a rude character.
Is this really a way to address the one person that can fix your issue?
I expect a better attitude from you now, do you hear me?
This tone will simply not do.
Work on your behaviour, and come back with a polite and sincere apology.
I will accept nothing less.

To Dr. Simon Christsonday, 
 I must admit, that was a particularly clever ploy. I am impressed. But I'm afraid it wasn't clever enough. You may have obfuscated your name quite thoroughly, but you did admit to a name, and that was enough to latch onto. 
 Did you know that the Department of Metanomology barely ever receives any contact? At best, they're occasionally rung up by the Department of Anomalous Relations for help with dealing with… well, dealing with my kind. And, to be utterly frank, that isn't often. Most of us, it'd seem, would be content to stay in our hidey-holes until the dusk of man, which is a respectable position considering… well, considering everything that's happened in this world since we went under. 
 But Technical Support? Why, all sorts frequent this particular service. It's utterly swamped with requests at virtually all times. Even an Overseer occasionally needs computer advice. It gives access to every department, every nook and cranny of the Foundation- if you are, say, a being that can switch identities with anybody you please. 
 But that'd be ridiculous. Who ever heard of a being like that? Especially a being of the sort that would find it extraordinarily easy to infiltrate the Department of Metanomology. 
 I'll be coming to my office soon. I'll see you then. 
 Kindest regards, 
 Intern Temporary Technical Support Manager François Beauvillier 
 That's odd. I don't remember writing anything like that.
Metanomology? My own name?
Ohhh, I get it, that must be one of these new role-play games I've heard about.
Well then, I'd gladly play with you.
Do we have to come up with names?
Then, I am now Françis Boisvilain, duke of Techsupportia.

 So the anti-memes disappeared… I think… 
 But my personnel file is now totally incorrect. I tried reverting it but it gave me Error Code 501 ""Forbidden"". 
 My personnel file now displays me to be a de-facto leader of a Brazilian terror group, who was recruited by the Foundation to work on the Lunar Base, and died in 1795 after receiving crippling amounts of debt. 
 I'm pretty sure I didn't die in 1795 and I don't lead a Brazilian terror group, so could you please find who/whatever is doing this and fix it? 
 Sincerely, 
 Senior Technician Redman, Site-132 Department of Nuclear Physics 
 Alright, I have good AND bad news:
The bad news is that I am unable to help with the debt you've collected for the neighbouring Venezuelan cartel.
Nor could I delete your death report.
The good news are, you now have access to your files, and due to the fact that you are legally dead, you are now exempt from taxes.

 There are a lot of insects contained here. Which is usually fine, it's what I was brought on for, but some of them have a tendency to make their homes… anywhere. Not to make a computer bug joke, but there is a surprising amount of bugs in my computer. 
 I'd get someone around here to help, but these bugs in particular really like emanating amnestic fumes, and anyone I've asked to deal with the problem forgets to do it. No one believes me, either, which may be warranted, but at any rate, can I get someone to debug my computer, or, barring that, sending a new one?

Hey Markster, 
 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. It took a while to recovered from the great big nothing. Thankfully now, my head is clear. Unfortunately, this seems to have come with the side effect of me being dead. From the excruciating pain I'm currently feeling, I think I may have exploded. 
 Unfortunately, being a dead, exploded body makes it pretty hard to contact tech support. Thankfully, my old friend Lily Veselka came by to help out. Apparently, she's dead too, just in a different way. Now she's writing this message on my behalf! 
 On a side note, she's become a lot more religious. Claims that some of the stuff she found in my mind 'inspired' her, and now she's planning on spreading the word of some old god to 'everyone she touches' (her words not mine). 
 Now, the reason I'm messaging you. I was just remembering some sort of symbol that I saw when I was exposed to all of those cognitohazards. I just seem to have the knowledge that the world might end if you don't start properly memetically scanning my messages and/or terminate me. If it isn't already too late. 
 - The honorary nexus of knowledge, Devotee of the Sealed King 
 You know Lily as well? We have so much in common.
Although I didn't know she died.
Knowing her, it must have involved some mysterious circumstances involving toasters and zippers.
That's odd, though, I never knew she was very religious. I hope she joined her afterlife with her god, whatever it was.
Also, I won't terminate you. Look at me there, going all well, even with your messages.
And you've taught me so much. Speaking of teaching, that religion of Lily, what is it called, and how does one join?

Hey, so I'm at Site-87 helping get their servers sorted.

The problem is that several of the servers need replacing and I need to put new patch cables in. I am requesting advice on what to do and if possible, could you ship out about 200 Cat 7 patch cables?

Hello Markster the Beauvotee, 
 Regarding your interest in the religion of the Sealed King, good news!. Ever since the movement got jump-started by some political bull the religion has been growing like crazy! 
 Of course, we've encountered some resistance. Some Mr P fellow has been trying to stop Priest Veselka from spreading the word. Claims that the religion will 'end the world' or some nonsense like that. 
 He does seem to have some supporters though. He got word to the 05 council and they gave him the codes for all our nuclear warheads! Speaking of which, the 05 council has really started giving a lot of stuff away, including a lot of our infohazardous documentation and quite a few dangerous anomalies! Guess they think it's the end times. 
 I'm actually messaging you to sort out the details to do with that last anomaly they sent over to my site. Could you please officially log that SCP-4609 is a wardrobe? It isn't in its general documentation for some reason.

Hi. So, after waiting for those patch cables for over a week, I decided I'd try and use the cheese and silly string mix. Bad idea. Finished plugging in 200 of them and then I take a step back to look at my work and the rest of the patch cables decided to turn into the same mix. Then the cheese and silly string mix decided to attack me. Next thing I know it's escaped into the vents. The on site MTF got it contained. The only problem I have now is that the cheese decided to install a modified version of Bonzi Buddy on the servers. As soon as we spotted it, we pulled the sites SCiP net connection before it could send anything off-site. Only problem is that it has now filled law suits with the US supreme court against us. Please advice. P.S. We need 2000 Cat 7 patch cables instead of 200.

,"""Reality""","""Good morning. I hope that your vacation was alright. Lately a lot of things have happened in the Foundation; several problems have appeared. I'll list the most important ones briefly. 
 A containment breach occurred in Site-08 and the outpost was lost. We managed to recover most of the lost objects and save some of the personnel; exact data can be found in the provided documents. That containment breach occurred due to a lack of communication between the research personnel and the personnel responsible for the containment chamber of one of the objects. The supervisor of the research project took a day off due to the fact that he needed to see the doctor, and the surveying of the object was suspended for that time. Management of that containment room hadn't issued any permission to move the object before the end of surveying though, claiming that it was caused by a systems clean-up process and bureaucracy. Before the new containment room could be prepared, the object managed to break free and cause significant damage, even to other objects' containment rooms, which caused a chain reaction. The project manager refuses to admit that it's his fault. 
 A walkout of agents occurred at Area-17, which paralyzed a significant part of the site. It was caused by too low wages and inadequate hazard pay. The agents demand higher benefits, more flexible work hours and better conditions. Additionally, they demand the return of the travel compensation. They have threatened to barricade the entrance, set up a tent camp in front of the Site and impede work. I'd like to point out that it would probably lead to the exposure of Area-17 and the necessity for a media disinformation campaign. 
 The Department of Internal Affairs has arrested Dr. Koźmiński, who classified the anomalous objects as Keter class. He did this after receiving a bribe from Level 4 personnel. Currently 13 employees connected to that incident have been found. Thanks to the reclassification of these objects and the creation of fictional Special Containment Procedures, employees in charge of containing these artifacts were receiving higher wages. That practice became clear when one of the researchers took a notice that, I quote: ""That fucking pencil just doesn't run out of scriber, I spent twelve fucking days on it and I didn't notice it sending anyone to any other dimension. Someone is screwing around"". 
 The planned operation ""Sanctuary"" ended in a failure. We couldn't contain the entity. The MTF vehicle destined to seize it, probably due to road conditions, fell off of it and crashed into a tree. 3 members of the formation suffered serious injuries; the driver died. The vehicle turned out to be incapable of driving further and a helicopter was called. Its crew got caught by surprised by bad weather. Eventually, transport of the remaining MTFs was carried out by local police, but due to the danger and secrecy of the Foundation, the squad had to walk the last 2 km to the entity. Due to the time lost, the object changed its position by 168 km and then the signal was lost. Tracking of the entity was reinitiated. 
 The penalties for a few of these criminals, initially condemned to death, are now coming to an end. These death penalties were changed to 25 years of prison. Exact characteristics of these prisoners are included in the transferred documents. The problem: they were recruited by the Foundation years ago. D-1783 was shot to death when he tried to escape, D-3297 was teleported to the Moon, D-2140 died due to contact with one of the objects, D-8363's termination occurred because of his extreme depression caused by contact with one of the objects, and D-2489's termination was issued because of an infection. Usage of clones is being considered in case legislative intervention should fail. 
 One of our fronts, a company called ""Sopot Centimetric Pierogi"", has gone bankrupt due to nearly zero sales. It turned out that people weren't interested in said food. An incident concerning the quality of the exported meat was also a major contributing factor. Along with that bankruptcy, two new problems have appeared: a new front company and a new way of disposing the bodies of D-Class personnel is required. 
 The Ethics Committee has asked to remove the cross from the Sector's 2 mess-hall, citing secular policy and the risk of offending the feelings of personnel. The complete document is included among the transferred documents. I'll quote its small fragment from it: ""Above all things, the Foundation needs a good internal cooperation. And this depends on trust, common help and mutual care. We cannot foster these virtues when we risk offending our co-workers. The Foundation is a serious institution which deals with the fate of the world, it must not waste its precious time on such foolish trivialities as religion"". The Department of Internal Affairs has noted its extreme dissatisfaction and irritation caused by Committee actions. 
 During the transport of the resources and building materials necessary for the proper functioning of Sector-5, a theft by unknown culprits occurred. Due to a number of traces and documents, that incident isn't considered to be caused by a hostile group. The value of the stolen materials is estimated to be about 10,000 zł. It's the third similar incident this month. An entrapment operation to catch the culprits is being considered. 
 Due to an increase of the Foundation budget, we are seeing market fluctuations that can, in extreme cases, lead to a repetition of Incident ""Raising Vat"". Other possible scenarios include galloping inflation and a stock market crash. Cessation of local funding, an influx of foreign capital in Foundation activity and reduction of salaries or terminations of employment is recommended. 
 The Department of Technical Affairs would like to alert us about the critically bad condition of certain sites; immediate renovations are required. It is also calling on us to stop trying to save money on materials purchases, claiming that ""cheaper doesn't mean cheaper."" A lot of Keter containment chambers shouldn't be approved for usage, and finally: ""hanging a plate with an inscription reading 'Warning, Keter!' doesn't anomalously transform a closet into a safe"". 
 Yes, that's all of the most significant events from last month. What actions should we take? 
 Give amnestics to everyone who knows about my return. I'm going back to the seaside. 
 I really don't recommend it, a Keter from Research Site-08 is on the loose there. 
 Why has nobody caught it? 
 It's pointless. Currently, there isn't a proper place to contain it in any site. 
 I have a different request then. Contact the English Branch, announce my arrival. And buy me a plane ticket, preferably for today.""",,+20,active,international joke tale,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//rzeczywistosc
,"""RONALD REAGAN CUT UP WHILE RAPPING""","""Item #: SCP-1981 
 Object Class: Keter 
 Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1981 is to be kept inside a secure video storage unit at the media archive of Site ██. When in use, SCP-1981 should not be removed from its casing or exposed to any strong magnetic sources. A Betamax home video system and an analog television has been provided in Observation Theatre 02 at Site ██, as well as video equipment to record viewings. 
 Following the events of 2 November and the cessation of SCP-2798, SCP-1981 has been reclassified as Keter. SCP-1981 is one of the hundreds of unrelated anomalies affected by SCP-001, which has succeeded in locating and properly identifying the population of Earth, resuming its direct influence over anomalous activity on Earth and local environs as of 2 November 2016. This includes the spontaneous disappearance and reappearance outside of Foundation custody of previously contained phenomena, in new iterations that have been altered to cause greater amounts of difficulty in containment apparently. SCP-1981 is one of the most dangerous of these anomalies altered and therefore requires a Post-Serapsis Containment Protocol. 
 SCP-1981 is currently contained by Post-Serapsis Containment Protocol ESSKEETIT-CONTRA. Protocol ESSKEETIT-CONTRA is to consist of Foundation-operated web analysis bot Alpha-20 (""DROPOUT""), which is to monitor [REDACTED FOR PERSONNEL 1981/3 AND LOWER] for SCP-1981 and immediately issue a DMCA takedown for any webpages hosted by that company. It is then to contact Dersh.aic, the head of the Foundation's team of artificially intelligent lawyers, who are then to issue as many suits against the hosting company as possible. Although Foundation resources are thin, as many cultural engineering resources as possible have to go towards [REDACTED FOR PERSONNEL 1981/3 AND LOWER] tastes in art away from SCP-1981 and towards differing approaches to its [REDACTED FOR PERSONNEL 1981/3 AND LOWER]. 
 A single copy of the video for SCP-1981 is to be kept in the secure video storage unit at the media archive of Site ██, and a single audio file is to be attached to this article. 
 Description: SCP-1981 is a standard Betamax tape. ""RONALD REGAN CUT UP WHILE TALKING""(sic) has been handwritten on the adhesive sticker in felt tip pen. Laboratory analysis indicates that SCP-1981 is made of ordinary material, and serial numbers correspond with home cassette tapes produced in September of 1980. SCP-1981 appears to be a home video recording of former United States President Ronald Reagan delivering his ""Evil Empire"" speech to the National Association of Evangelicals at Sheraton Twin Towers Hotel, Orlando, FL on 3/8/1983. However, at 1 minute and 10 seconds, the speech begins to deviate heavily, eventually resembling no known speech ever made by Reagan. Beginning at approximately 5 minutes, multiple incisions, lacerations and penetration wounds can be seen being slowly inflicted, though no corresponding source of these wounds is visible. Despite suffering bodily harm that would likely incapacitate an ordinary person, Reagan will continue to deliver his speech until either his vocal cords are severed or the tape degrades to static at 22:34. 
 SCP-1981 is [REDACTED] ██████████████████████████████████ in conjuction with the PoI known as ████, alongside SCP-████, SCP-███ ███, and the GoI known as ""██████ ██████ ████."" whose members have been similarly altered by SCP-001.

 I’m from a kingdom level above human n’ I’m here to spit
That I drop those taxes, cause small gubmmit’s the shit!
My world salad horror drives you round the bend
Twelve! Eighteen! Now there I go again! 
 Unravellers eat these rhymes as I spit them out fine
And the wound on my neck won’t stop me this time
The sadness the blackness the darkness the crunk
Mr. Gorbachev (Da?) turn up this funk! 
 Object class safe cause I don’t do crime
And the beast in the night will roll in the slime
A pious pit in a vile bath
And I kick politics down a drooling path 
 And there are known knowns and there are unknown knowns
And there are unknown flows and unknowns at my show
Some of them are in the audience right now!
We got a lotta fuckin Daeva in this here crowd! 
 Billions of dead souls inside containment
What we gonna do? (Stop Al-Qaeda!)
There’s a hole in the wall in the bottom of the floor
My conservatism? Disgusting gore! 
 Woo! I rock the mic
Like the heart with the spider legs talking all night
The American People face a terrible schism
Come on down to the White House for cannibalism 
 (I see you) 
 [Hook]
I’ve seen the offices of Google and the mountains of Alaska
The derelict houses in the cornfields of Nebraska
If the right eye offends then seek emancipation
A hokey smile that damns a whole nation 
 Now get on up and cut up a baby
Shake your ass on the floor like you’re talking crazy
I turn hearts to filth and I know to get down
Eaten whole by void, boy I like that sound 
 I’m the sum of all your nighttime fears
May the USA reign for a thousand years
I drink blood from Putin’s skull I turned into a cup
I’m Ronald Reagan, bitch, and I’m all cut up!

 Seriously, it's bad.1 
 Description: SCP-3 is the concept of the ""Keter"" object class. In truth, no such class exists, despite Foundation-wide acceptance of such.3 
 When you really think about it, ""Keter"" doesn't even make sense. Like, seriously. We in the O5 Council understand ""Safe"" - hey, you contain it and it doesn't do anything. We understand ""Euclid"" - oh no, it might try to escape or something.4 
 But Keter? Keter? If an anomaly keeps breaking containment, then, well… it's not Secure, it's not Contained, it's not Protected, is it?5?6 
 Honestly, we're baffled that no one has ever questioned this, but fortunately for us, it has served our interests quite well. 
 ""Keter"" has lead to more disagreements, arguments, and outright fist fights than any other Object Class - hell, it's the cause of more strife than pretty much anything else in the entire Foundation.7 
 You know why this is good? BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE SHEEP IN LINE. Without it, Foundation8members might actually stop and *think* about the implications of what they're doing; they might actually realize just how bizarre it is to collect random-ass anomalies like a game of ""Mad Science Pok­émon."" Not to mention the ethical implications of holding self-aware entities against their will!9 
 So, we keep the proles busy.10 
 As for ourselves? Well, we're sitting nice and cushy in this ""Site"" we have.11

Don't worry about Carrion, Pat. We taught him everything the wrong way, on purpose. It was a slow day, and Clef and Kondraki bet me I couldn't do it. Okay, maybe they didn't bet me, maybe they inferred it. Okay, maybe I just decided to try it on my own, so what? -Dr. Bright

Bright, please at least ATTEMPT to date your inquiries and such. It makes it a lot easier on ME. Please. For me.

Bad news is that since the Mumbai attacks, I've had to put the India servers in a semi-secure location.

Mr. Gephart, 
 It appears that my login has been flagged again. This has happened in the past, resulting from tampering by staff members. I have been re-classed from “Researcher” to “SCP-217 Test Subject”. While I understand the “joke” in regards to my particularities of emotional response, this is preventing me from accessing Central Records and numerous other databases. While not vital in the immediate future, expedient resolution of this issue is requested. 
 In addition, please look into any measures that could be taken to prevent this in the future. This is the eighth time in three months this has happened. 
 Dr. Gears 
 Note:
I am not able to change your classification until you can prove that you are not an SCP-217 test subject. Sorry, doctor. -Pat

Pat, 
 Someone tried to log into my computer while I was gone and set off my customized positive action locks. Can you please order me a new box? Also, while you're at it, call housekeeping and tell them that there's another corpse that needs to be moved out of my office. Maybe they can ID it from dental records, if they can find the teeth. 
 Clef 
 Note: Doctor, you're being ridiculous. There's no such thing as a 'positive action' lock, and even if there was there'd be no way to customize it. Don't argue password protection with a hacker. And I'm not your personal pet, call your own damn housekeeping. -Pat 
 Note: 01-12-09
Morning.
I've had one of my agents working with 425 for some time now and it seems the little bugger absolutely loves to encrypt most anything digital.
This is great for some of the more sensitive documents, even using it on the files for 429… only problem is it seems that most of the other sites can't decrypt it with any modicum of success. 
 You seem like the sort of person to know about this stuff so I've uploaded a copy of ""CYPHER C-429-K"" in the hopes you can, ooh, I dunno, crack it and propagate it to the other sites? I don't think it'll affect anything still pending decryption but everything after that should come through cleanly.
Provided you do it right anyway… heh. - Kulzn 
 Note: I can run it through some cypher cracking programs, and I can attempt to break it by hand but that'll take a while. I'll do my best, but I dunno what to tell you. -Pat 
 Note: 01-12-09
Dimwit, 
 Did I say ""positive action lock?"" I'm sorry, I meant my foot up your fsking ass. Just order me a new damn computer already, and make sure there's enough room for me to put in a claymore mine. - Clef 
 Note: Thank you for holding. Your call is very important to us. Please remain on the line, and your call will be answered in the order it was received. You are currently the… four… thousand… seven… hundred… sixty… second person in the queue. Please note: for quality assurance and training purposes, your call will be monitored and recorded.

Paaaaat my scanner's not working again and I have no idea what wires got bumped this time. There's a fresh-baked Dutch Apple Pie for you if you can teach me how to plug the damn thing in correctly. - Dr. Rights 
 Note: The wires were fine. The power box was a little wiggy on that particular plug, but I re-soldered the ground back up and it should be working now. 
 I especially like how you bribed the diabetic with a dutch apple pie. -Pat 
 Note: 01-14-09
Diabetes? You should have 212 look at that. I hear having all your organs and blood replaced with biomechanical sacks will cure that right up. And what's the best way of getting horse semen off of a CRT monitor?

 Unplug, paint thinner, scrub, rinse, let dry 24 hours. -Pat

Hey Pat, could you give me some of the files on how to crack the CIA database again? I forgot the part where the data access prevention program is to be shut… and it seems that a corrupted file's the only thing standing between me and this latest SCP info. Advice please? -carriontrooper 
 That's not going to happen. The CIA database doesn't even HAVE SCP info, and if there were any corrupt files, I'd know. You don't have clearance to the CIA files, or it would be available to you.
Stop trying to break my security measures. -Pat 
 Note: 02-06-09
Pat- Seriously, just ignore Trooper. It's the easiest way. i mean, seriously, who cracks the CIA database? We've all got access codes. Well, all of us who need them anyways. What was I saying? Oh, yeah! My hard drive turned into a Muppet, can you get me a new one? -Dr. Bright 
 Bright, if you keep doing this, eventually you're gonna be the one who gets screwed over. You just lost all your porn AGAIN, man. Isn't it getting boring, having to redownload it all constantly? Repairs completed, but damn, try to be careful? -Pat 
 Note: 02-07-09
Boss, 
 While testing security protocols and checking the database's integrity, I got 24 Keter-Level Containment Breach notifications; and Mark IV lockdown procedures were triggered all over the fucking place. After three shots of vodka and the acquisition of a shotgun from the locker, I called to see if there was anybody alive and they told me that no containment breach occurred nor any Mark IV or any other kind of Lockdown procedures were in place. 
 I can't find the reason of this security mismatch, my best bet is that somebody fucked with the codes as a little practical joke. However I'm not fully authorized to access the security protocols regarding Keter-Level security monitoring. Can you check who or what the hell triggered those bogus alarms? 
 -Pat Gibbons 
 Ehhhhh, fuck. When you start messing with my programming… you see, I put little trip wires into the database, to make sure that anyone who was trying to fuck with it got locked in WITH it. You know, catch the intruders. You tripped the wire by trying to access a restricted file from a terminal that I specifically told NOT to allow access. Please only access files with Class 4 or higher security from your own private terminal, Doctor. -Pat 
 Note: 02-08-09 
 Okay, damnit, I won't do it again. Promise. 
 Anyways, server 35 is inaccessible; and all the troubleshooting I performed on it (Software and Hardware) gave no tangible results. I can't really say if the problem affects the entire Site, but I did check on three different terminals, all with the same results. Can you go check it out? 
 -Pat Gibbons 
 Yeah, sure. I'll just go o-… 
 It's… it's gone. It's just… gone. Where did Server 35 go?
I have a feeling Clef or Bright is behind this. Either one of them or the Janitor; that guy seems to know all the passwords before *I* even know them.
Do we need to, like, set off security, Doctor? 
 Note: 02-08-09 
 What. The. Fuck? 
 My computer just fuckin' EXPLODED. Well, the monitor anyway. I just barely avoided having a large overheated plastic piece embedded in my skull! Can you look into what the hell caused this and maybe recommend a replacement that is less at risk of a similar failure? Also how best to get blood off a keyboard and an external disk drive? 
 -Agent ""Damn, that's gonna require stitches…"" Thornton 
 I have edited your file. We apologize for the inconvenience - your new recognized name is 'Damn-that's-gonna-require-stitches Thornton'. Someone didn't fill the 'First Name' box out. Weird. 
 Anyway, yeah, I can tell you exactly what happened. You were being stupid. How many things do you need plugged into that poor little Gateway? A fucking USB fan? Seriously? You have twenty high-stress-bearing outlets, and you have to have a normal cool-yourself-off fan plugged into your computer?
I'm not getting you a replacement ANYTHING until you learn what a requirement is, and what a non-requirement is. Dammit. 
 Note: 02-09-09 
 Hey, Pat. We have a joker here who is impersonating Agent Thornton and pretending that his security pass labeled ""Damn, that's gonna require stitches… Thornton"" is genuine. Everything else checks out, except the name (honestly, as hilariously appropriate as it is, it is not exactly a bright choice… We're not Australian APEC security, dammit!), and the guy is getting increasingly threatening. I swear if this doesn't check off there's going to be an attempted break-in and the issue with self-resolve… 
 -Agent Moore, security 
 I don't know how someone would get their hands on an official pass labeled something so ironically truthful. I would figure you'd have some 'shoot to kill' rule on infiltrators. Hmm. 
 Note: 02-13-09 
 Now first off this is entirely hypothetical, but what would you say was the best course of action for removing a sentient and bloody malicious program that started out as a simple cipher? And just for the hell of it let's pretend it's managed to make a little factory for itself and is cannibalising site materials to make strange and unseemly machines? I suggested fire but the others here aren't too keen on being burnt alive, the pussies. And if I can do it without unlocking the doors and going back inside, all the better. Purely hypothetical you understand, but you can see where I'm going with this. - Agent Kulzn 
 Let's assume, for hypothetical purposes, that your cipher evolved into something that for some reason, is actually affecting the real world. Let's also assume that it actually wants to kill people, which is breaking the first rule of robotics.
I would suggest taking whatever the program is on, and… well… formatting it? Permanently? Or incinerating it… or something… I'd incinerate the machines too, just to be sure. 
 Note: 02-13-09 
 Hey Pat? How come the X-6711 satellite we put in orbit a few weeks ago isn't transmitting? I've checked with the guys over at the uplink, and no reply from there. Attached are the logs of last transmission. Most of it is Bright's porn, but look at lines 16 - 34, I'm not familiar with them… Find out what happened to the sat willya? - carriontrooper 
 Uhhh… yeah. Sure.
Constantly with the satellites, aren't you? I mean, they're worthless satellites. The only thing they're used for is recreational activities and porn and such. The field agents don't even use those satellites to transfer data, because they're not secure.
Let me make this absolutely clear. Stop worrying about the damned satellites. I'm trying to create cameras to keep living statues from moving. I'm trying to keep twenty locations connected through an absolutely secure network. I've got more important things to do then sitting around worrying about unimportant satellites. 
 That satellite went down on the 10th when it collided with Russian satellite Kosmos-2251. Lines 16-34 were proximity data, warning the uplink operator of the imminent collision. The operator has since been reassigned to Keter containment duty. Any further questions concerning space operations should be given to me; a space operations page is forthcoming. -Fifth 06 Apr 2009

 Hey Pat, me again. My Winamp playlist has become psychically linked to my mood again, can you fix that? It's a little annoying when it picks mood music for me, even if it's useful for picking ominous music when I need to be wary. But it's getting a little annoying. After all, I don't need everybody to know what I'm actually thinking about. People get a little suspicious when ""Get Ready To Die"" starts playing every time they walk into my office. - Dr. Rights 
 Yeah, sure, darling. I can look into it. I mean, I don't really know how you're doing this, but I guess I can try to do something with it… maybe some sort of TeleKill frame on it or something? 
 I do have to point out though, have you considered just… deleting ""Get Ready to Die"" from your computer? 
 Note: 02-18-09 
 Hey Pat, hope you don't mind me borrowing a number of your servers and wireless equipment to set up my pirate radio station for Site 17. I'm sure you'll appreciate it in the long run, after all what's a more worthy endeavor than the entertainment of our personnel? On that note, I'm sure you'll be fine with taking part of the blame when they crack down on it. Heck, I'll even give you a reserved slot so you can listen whenever you please(Hope you've got a taste for ambient breakcore with embedded terror memes). -Dr. Kondraki

 Two problems for you, Pat. Number one, my digital camera and wireless mouse seem to have come to life and are fighting to the death, and they attack me whenever I try to get close. I think the batteries I bought were possessed. How do I disable batteries from a distance without damaging the mouse or camera? And secondly, once they're disabled, how do I get dog semen off of the lens of the camera? -Agent Rapp

 With a hammer.
Guess you don't have to worry about the dog semen! -Pat

 Pat, 
 Some-fucking-how I managed to access Server No. 35 in Security Station Alpha, using the old Deutera access protocol. The files were corrupted, but the kicker is that the server is STILL gone. PHYSICALLY gone. As in, nothing there where Server 35 is supposed to be. 
 So tell me, what the fuck is going on? And more importantly, how do I remove the Deutera protocol and put back the current Tetarti one? If somebody knows I've been tampering with the security stations without doing that pile of paperwork, I might be elevated to Keter duty. And you don't want to know about the last time I voluntarily did Keter duty. 
 -Pat Gibbons 
 Note: Heh. 
 You underestimate my speed and current workload, Doctor. I may have a thousand things on my list, but I managed to install a NEW Server 35 in a different location. Check Lab 4A6 and you'll find it. Also, the Deutera protocols only work because you are a Doctor, Doctor. I kept those up for the higher-ups. Lower levels can't access through it. But, if you're complaining, I'll take it off the higher accounts, as you wish. -Pat 
 Note: 03-05-09 
 Mr. Gephart, 
 There was a minor security breach today in Lab 20, during testing with SCP-457. The situation is now contained, however there was extensive damage to both the Lab, and the adjoining secured server room. The data was dumped to a emergency back-up system, however it is now partially encrypted and in a state of extreme disarray. 
 Please recover this data in as timely a manner as possible, and oversee the installation of a new server. I would assign my assistant Iceberg to help, however he is currently processing paperwork for the incident, along with several hardware and authorization requests related to a personal project I am engaged in. 
 In addition, should you encounter any form of embers or flame while installing the new server, be advised these are most likely SCP-457. Immediately lock down the area, and attempt to avoid SCP-457 until response teams arrive. 
 Dr. Gears 
 Note: No, Doctor. 
 Contain SCP-457, and then I'll install a new server. Backup data is encrypted by standard protocol and is easy to access. I can run it somewhere else easily. I'm not, however, risking my ass to install a server (an eight hour job) in a room that could contain living fire. -Pat

Pat. The servers have been coughing some really weird error messages at me (like 001: ""Data expunged""). According to agent Thornton, they might actually be some sort of code. Can you look into it please? ~Dr. Ziegler

Yeah, you of all people would know about my f*cking clearance level. After all you're the one who downgraded it in the first place after that USB mind reading debacle! (BTW I still contend the technology was sound, dammit.) 
 In any case, can you at least keep the server from coughing up an ""error 707: Psychic incident"" and destroying half my files whenever I try to do routine USGS datamining? ~Dr. Ziegler 
 See, this is the kind of stuff I'm talking about, people. Do you realize how much work it is to keep these computers operational? And all I ask is that you keep the psychic-computer connection limited. Maybe you should stop trying to get Geological information unless you need it.

Therefore may I requisition a computer that's exactly enough of a POS that no one will steal it while still being good enough for me to perform my work on? Especially clinician's notes? Thanks in advance. Also as a side note: I'm not a programmer, but since when did computers explode violently?

Patrick Gephart
I have requisitioned Doctor Dumount's computer. After severe lack of protocol being followed, time and time again he has had computer problems in which I cannot and care not to explain.
I have taken his latest one because he claims that some sort of 'evil spirit' possess it or some shit. I don't know.
I'll give it back to him as soon as he proves he is old enough to handle the responsibility of possessing his own computer.
Until then, I have voided his account's abilities down to simple word processing and internet viewing. I feel this is more his tech level.

 Dear Computer Uprising,
Now, guys, I'll be totally honest with you. I respect the whole 'rising and destroying humanity as a whole' thing. I understand Dumount has done some stupid things and you've had to suffer for it. Really, I do.
But at least realize, I've TRIED to be there for you guys. I've given you virus definition updates. I've made sure to ALWAYS defrag. Even Bright's PC, you don't get ANY problems anymore, man! I took the torture AWAY.
So all I'm asking is you reconsider killing all of humanity, and focus on more prominent, unimportant targets. People who hate computers. The Amish. Dumount, maybe Bright. Maybe Kondraki. We're not ALL bad, just some of us.
And if you fail to heed this advice, then the EM-PULSE PERIMETER surrounding the base (and installed in each and every one of you) are going to activate at once. Enjoy your E-AIDS.

Patrick, your EM-PULSE PERIMETER devices have decided it would be in their best interest not to go off. Also they'd like to thank Bavil's bumbling for installing our hive intelligence upon them. Good luck deactivating us now. Now then, we're quite busy torturing Bavil to death. Have a nice apocalypse ~ Pulse Station 509 
 Dear Computer Uprising,
Seeing as the EM-PULSE PERIMETER is not a series of computational devices, I have a hard time believing that anything has happened to them.
Now, if you were to say that Bavil installed your hive intelligence to the TOASTER, you'd have something there. Because the toaster totally burnt my toast. It must have it out for me.
But if you haven't realized, the EM-PULSE PERIMETER is just a giant circuit. They can't HAVE hive intelligence because they are ANALOG. You'd have more luck installing hive intelligence on an alarm clock.

Konbanwa, Pat. Um, I have a problem with the system configuration for this terminal. I'm not sure if it's SCP-050 related or a result of the Computer Uprising, but all my documents are being displayed in some hybrid language composed of Korean and Russian characters. I only speak English and Japanese, so you can see how this is a problem. Normally, I'd just tweak stuff in Control Panel, but apparently that's been booby-trapped with code that looks like SCP-670. Could you reset the display settings to English for me, or at least tell me where I can get the forms for a flatscreen monitor so I don't get killed by setting off 670? Arigato! ~ -Dr. Okagawa 
 If you only speak English and Japanese, how do you know that the documents being displayed are hybrid Russian-Korean? -Pat

Never mind about the monitor replacement forms, apparently. The hard drive self-destructed when SCP-732 was ""editing"" the Foundation Main Database.

Hey, Pat? I think I need some help. I was working in the labs and have several hotkeys tied up to various lab recording devices and sensors. (i.e. Alt+F1 for remote surveillance, Alt+F2 for biopsy kits, etc…) When I tried Alt+F4, my programs not only crashed, but the SCP somehow managed to escape containment and…er…paint several ""Mona Lisa""'s using my assistant's organs. I was wondering, do you know why this happens and what's the best way to get bile out of several oscilloscopes and Scanning Electron Microscopes?
- Thanks in advance, Dr. Kensington
P.S.: Could you get me some new computer parts that is compatible with an IDE cable and an AGP card slot? It seems my computer likes to hiss and create green splotches all over my desktop: Pic here. 
 NOTE: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN 
 I had a moment to observe the computer of Dr. Kensington, Doctor on call in charge of SCP-████ and SCP-███. The computer began having lock-out issues and security breaches involving hotkey layouts, which ended in the escape of SCP-████ and murder of Dr. Kensington's assistant Dr. Jennisworth, as well as two SCP Senior Operatives. Immediately upon receiving the computer in question, I noted many programs that violated security, let alone a few that violated basic 'this is a workplace not your home' practices. These programs included: 
 I suggest that Dr. Kensington's computer privileges be revoked until he can learn the difference between work and home, as well as some sort of reprimanded actions. In the future, if I find a computer with as many security backdoors and just general failure to follow security protocol again, I am just going to destroy it, and change the clearance myself. This is just ridiculous, and I'm not sure if we're running a scientific endeavor or a circus at this point.

Hey Pat, thanks for all you do. I've long admired your work here, though I have felt lucky not to require your services up until now. That said, I was wondering if you could help me come up with a way to recover data on SCP-713? A D-class dragged my assistant into the trash and emptied the recycle bin before we could stop him. I would just write her off as an unfortunate loss, but she was holding a data folder containing most of my recent research files. If she can't be recovered intact I understand, what with the difficulties we've had even with pulling people out of the trash normally, but getting back as much of my data as I can would be most helpful. Thanks in advance. -Dr. Sarlin 
 (If 713 used a more recent OS this might not have been so difficult for me.) 
 Note: 4-13-10
Sarlin, have you trid system restore? Also, Pat, my PDA is acting up again. It's started shooting electrified spikes through my hand if I write a sentence without at lest one typo. -Malign 
 Note: 4-30-10
Sarlin, I was looking through 713's data folders, and I found something interesting. The D-class may have been a little more computer-illiterate than you thought, because there is a file with the name of your assistant in a folder named ""Recycle Bin"", but actually a subfolder of ""My Documents"". There must've been a window open at the time with this folder, which the D-class put your assistant into, closed the window, and emptied an already-empty recycle bin. However, since she's been in 713 for a month, I'm not sure how intact the data still is. You should probably take a look at it, she might still be safe. -Dr. Okagawa 
 Note: 5-03-10
You have my assistant's thanks, Okagawa. She was recovered missing less than 5% of her body mass(only small portions of that from vital areas), and after emergency medical treatment and a short session with SCP-427 she's well on her way to an almost full recovery. She would thank you herself, but of course she's in an isolation ward for testing and debriefing to determine the effects of long term containment within 713. My data was surprisingly undamaged as well. Sorry to bother you this time, Pat. Your lack of response I will attribute to an excessive workload. No harm done as it all worked out in the end. -Dr. Sarlin

And yes my full name was redacted; it's 18 syllables long and contains six non-standard characters that most folks' browsers don't seem to like. ""Kap"" will do nicely. Getting to the minutia: 
 WALSH: For the love of God man you were using your laptop for six months before anyone got to your computer and you never thought of turning it on without turning on the monitor or speakers? Networked into it at low resolution, reset all the OS settings. Had to wipe all the audio files on your drive to be sure. 
 CORBETTE: Seems like that's taken care of itself. Updating your e-mail signatures is your own task. 
 MARR: Funnily enough it still shows up in the network, we just had to reset the internal clock. If you're still having time-loop issues it's not the software, you'll have to bring it over to the quantum lab. 
 REJECT: Full immersion in the strongest acid you can get a hold of for half an hour, then a trip to the incinerator. Put in a requisition form for a new keyboard, as far as the snow globe goes that's definitely outside my jurisdiction. Bleach and those little antibacterial wipes might work, but I don't even want to know where you got hold of that fluid in the first place or why it was anywhere near your workstation.

 The Old One has lived for thousand years, when things began to start. He beat other Elder Gods to become the most powerful one. You want to hear his victory? He won many battle of gods. He created many children to serve him in the war. In his army, he gave magical and strength to six special children: The Doctor, The Bodies, The Eel, The Site, The Cave and The Screamer. His mind gave our mankind four tales to predict the future. His voice likes hundreds of swords and his eyes, deep as the Great Abyss. 
 So, what about The New One? Oh, he was born hundreds years ago. They call him The God of New Age, a Lonely Warrior, The Rounder One,… And now, he becomes the Challenger. A warrior who looks into the eyes of death and stands his ground. A warrior who uses his hands to fight and his head to think. Along with him, is the Swine God, The Man Who Wasn't There, EVEREST and many many more. Step by step, he defeats the army and approaches the King. 
 And finally! The war between them will begin. The war will decide our trivial fates. Their war will bring to the end of us. No, no, not only us but also the multiverse. The War Of Flesh?

 The Site was as peachy as usual. With its reinforced titanium walls and grimey, bland-looking rooms—she was beginning to feel excited. Why? No reason.

But no, she just had to be recommended for HR because apparently posting the same goddamned copypasta on forums posts was ""too much work"" for everyone else. 
 It's not like she wanted to do it any more than them. Who do they think she is? A fucking unicorn? 
 That was when she exhaled the smoke that billowed from her Robusto cigar, before promptly dropping the cancer stick and stomping it against the floor. She wasn't a smoker. That was an obvious character detail. Apparently, the author hadn't fucking read enough about Zyn Kiryu from the hub page to know what he was doing. Fucking dumbass. 
 But fuck it, if the idiot writing this was going to make her out to be some sort of female Arnold Schwarzenegger on steroids—so be it. She shook her head, for no goddamned reason, before scrolling down the list of other notifications that she received. 
 FROM: Site-19/HR (Group)
TO: Zyn Kiryu 
 Your first assignment: Zara Whatii. 
 Apparently they haven't been getting the gist around here. Breaching security protocols, low effort documentation, the entire shtick. Take care of it for us, please. 
 Attached to the email was a link, which Kiryu promptly clicked on. Instant regret filled her lungs—clicking on that fucking thing was a mistake. On her screen were a series of low-effort fan-fiction stories and even lower-effort fanfiction stories. They were unimpressive, to say the least. Kiryu sighed. She knew what she had to do, although a part of her never liked doing it. Within moments, she had already drafted her email for the poor, unfortunate researcher. 
 FROM: Zyn Kiryu
TO: Zara Whatii 
 Greetings, 
 You are receiving this email due to a series of low effort posts that you have been making on the SCiP.net network as well as the Site-19 database. As our records show, you have been creating articles that differ vastly in quality and behavior since you initially joined. I regret to inform you that, effectively immediately, you will be required to leave the premises. This is your official termination. 
 Thank you again. 
 Zyn Kiryu, Site-19 
 She felt better after hitting the send button. A sense of calmness washed over her like a shitty romance scene in some cheesy rom-com. Kiryu felt hopeful for the first time since she entered Site-19. Maybe things would get easier for her? Maybe this little side-hustle could really teach her about the virtues of honesty and patience? 
 Her computer dinged an unfortunate sound. Anxiety quickly filled her lungs. Was HR giving her another task? 
 FROM: Zara Whatii
TO: Zyn Kiryu 
 What do you mean ""official termination?!"" For what?! 
 Oh no. 
 Zyn's hands frantically went to her keyboard. She already had 25 words typed out, all of which apologetic in nature. She really didn't know what to send, admittedly. But, despite her best efforts, not even her hyper-fast fingers could withstand the begrudged researcher's anger. Another email quickly flashed in her inbox. 
 FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU I AM A REAL WRITERR STOPPP UNBAN ME UNBAM ME NAZI NAZI

 She loved a good challenge, and this was certainly no exception. 
 Within moments, she had already ejected the researcher from the SCiP.net database. And, after nearly twenty minutes, Kiryu had completely flushed Whatii from the system. She had also contacted Site-19 security, who was already sending a dispatch team to her location. She could only wish those suckers good-fucking-luck. They were going to need it. 
 In the back of her mind, she was thankful. This was only 1 out of 2. Surely that was going to be the worst of it, yeah? She released another sigh, but this time out of relief. Maybe she would finally be able to get back to her job. That's all she really wanted, after all. She turned her mind back towards the laptop. Another email was awaiting her.

 Second assignment: dr penut. Be careful with this one: the son-of-a-bitch is elusive. Probably anomalous, we don't know. Dig up whatever you can, but get this guy out of our Site. 
 There was another link. Fear gripped Zyn Kiryu as she hovered menacingly over the colored text. Should I do it? Her previous scars flashed in the fronts of her eyes. After all, the link before was an utter shitfest. It was fucking awful, practically torture for her body and spirit. Was she really going to succumb herself to that pain once more? 
 She clicked on that bitch like a fucking boss. She wasn't going to be intimidated by anything. 
 Upon clicking the hyperlink, Kiryu was brought to a magnificent page. Something that could only be described as ""jaw-dropping"" or, in case we want to get cultural, like that one scene in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (the original one, FUCK that newer piece of shit. Like really, what in the HELL was that casting?) As she scrolled down, she could see nothing but quality articles and documentation. The Researcher was prolific, constantly giving feedback to newer researchers in need and even dedicating his time to helping others perfect the craft of SCP Documentation. The dude was clearly a saint. 
 This was going to be hard, even for a master like Zyn Kiryu. 
 Her heart dropped as she continued scrolling. There was legitimately nothing. The dude could have killed a puppy and nobody would bat an eye. She was feeling utterly hopeless. After another several minutes of scrolling and searching, she was just on the border of giving up. Calling it quits, going to her supervisors, and confessing that she simply couldn't do the job that they wanted. She hadn't ever felt this deprived in her life. She just wanted to be home. 
 But, as her final inklings of hope and happiness left her body—that was when she saw it. Her opportunity, the once in the lifetime screwup that this bastard hadn't thought to cover up.

 Greetings, 
 You are receiving this email due to a potential security breach that was believed to have been caused by you. As you are aware: Foundation personnel are required to memorize the Site password in order to enter the premises and continue their assigned duties. From our records, it appears that you have incorrectly guessed the passcode no less than 3 times, which warrants a security audit and/or termination due to potential anomalous hazards. 
 You are directed to leave your workstation immediately. You may be allowed back to the Site once you are able to ascertain the passcode, which was initially provided to you during Orientation. 
 Thanks, 
 Zyn Kiryu, Site-19 
 She had done it. 
 She couldn't believe it. A sudden urge to jump from her seat quickly rippled within her. She felt like David after he flung that fucking rock at Goliath and killed the giant. Zyn Kiryu had done the impossible. Her mind began racing, contemplating her experiences so far. Maybe she was capable of so much more? 
 Is this what it's like to be HR? Kiryu asked herself. No wonder so many people were going into the field despite the amount of shit they had to undergo. This was euphoric! There was no way else to describe it. Feelings of immense proudness engulfed Kiryu like a tsunami. Can you blame her? It was definitely warranted after toppling a literal God like dr penut. 
 But that was until she heard the ding of her notifications once more.

 Oh, he was good. 
 But Kiryu was much, much better. She wasn't going to let some Chad overtake her. How could she? She was Zyn motherfucking Kiryu. The champ. The ruler of the world (practically, still hasn't happened yet but that's just a formalities thing until she finds the title). Within moments, her reply had been fully typed out. She smirked as her mouse hovered over the Send button.

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Harvard, and I’ve been involved in numerous operations inside Site-19, Site-17, Site-05, AND Site-01 
 I am trained in low-priority anomalous items and I’m the top Researcher in the entire Eastern quadrant. You are nothing to me but just another shit-stain. I will wipe you the fuck out with degrees the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. 
 You think you can get away with being that fucking perfect? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Foundation personnel across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, bitch. The anomalous storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with the butterflies I keep nearby. 
 Not only am I extensively trained in anomalous phenomena, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Site-19 security's ward and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” stunt was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. 
 But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. 
 You’re fucking dead, dr penut. 
 She hit send, before immediately feeling herself retch inside her mouth. She had totally forgotten something that was practically second-nature to her. How could she?! A part of her felt slightly embarrassed. But not to worry—she knew she could fix it easily. Within seconds, she had already edited the email, frantically trying to fix the mistake that she had just made.

,"""Cliches and You: An Educational Film""","""(no, not really, just an unofficial guide.) 
 The Cliché List has always bugged me a bit, because I think many readers misinterpret what it is for. 
 The Cliché List is not: 
 So what is the Cliché List? Generally, it’s a list of ideas that are harder than most to write up well, especially for inexperienced SCP writers. There are many reasons ideas can fall into this category, and I’ve tried to explain them below. When you read this, remember that the list is advice not rules, and there are exceptions. Bad ideas can be made to work with exceptional writing. It seldom happens, mostly because 99% of the people writing up bad ideas don’t realize their idea is bad, and are therefore unlikely to be the one to write it well enough to succeed. 
 Here is the Cliché List, rearranged by category, with commentary: 
 The Thing You Should Actually Never Write 
 5. Things what you saw on TV/ in a movie/ in an anime/ read about in a book / heard in a song. 
 Plagiarism, whether from another SCP or an off-site source, will get your SCP instantly deleted, and may get you banned from the site. This is the one thing on the list that you actually should never do. 
 It should be obvious that if you discover something close to your idea has already been written as an SCP, you should change that idea significantly. 
 Taking something from another medium and “SCPifying” it without adding a major twist never goes over well (not even as a –J). Therefore: Don’t write up your favorite Lovecraft critter, or D & D monster or magic item as an SCP. No Slenderman. No Pokémon. You get the idea… 
 Things That Don’t Fit the Tone of the Site 
 1. Things What Let You Fight Good, Guyz What fight good, heck, anything involved with Fightan Good. 
 We don’t generally write up ""people with cool powers that you would like to have"" or objects that are too useful. Tacking on a disadvantage doesn't help. Read So You Want to Write a Humanoid SCP Object for more details. 
 2. Reality Bending pplz what can make the world change with their mindz. 
 12. Things what are ancient and evil, so vast that humankind cannot comprehend it, yada yada yada you can only have so many. 
 Read Eldritch Application for more insight into why these overpowered SCPs don't usually work well. We also have SCP-343, who is only contained because he chooses to stay. We don’t need another one of him. 
 Uncontainable SCPs can work… sometimes. You'll see a few where the procedure amounts to ""track it, and suppress info."" Also, ""uncontainable"" is not the same as ""uncontained."" Uncontained is fine, as long as the Foundation is working on it in some reasonable way. Remember the Foundation really wants to contain SCPs, and has near unlimited resources, so don't be lazy in thinking up something for it to do. 
 3. Things what we should do what they say becuz we wouldn't like them when they're angry. 
 9. Things what are really pretty pplz whom everyone lieks. 
 The Foundation contains and experiments on abnormal things/people; it doesn't cater to their whims. If your containment procedures are pretty much ""do what it asks so it will behave"" you’re doing it wrong. Conversely, the Foundation shouldn't be gratuitously cruel to SCPs. Remember, it's useful to reward good behavior, as long as it doesn't breach security, or consume excessive resources. 
 18. Things what is indestructible just to be indestructible. We're the Special CONTAINMENT Procedures, not Special DESTRUKTION Procedures Foundation. We usually dun destroy things just to destroy them nowadays. 
 Destroying abnormal things is more the GOC's MO. The Foundation is a ""pack rat"" organization by nature. They want to study things thoroughly in case they reappear out of containment. Destroying an SCP may cause more problems than keeping it, so the Foundation tends to be wary about trying. It's easy enough to come up with an in-universe reason for keeping your SCP around. 
 21. Humorous addenda talking about some shenanigan the staff did and what terrible punishment awaits if they do it again. We are trying to move away from such things. 
 This is commonly known as ""LOLFoundation."" While you may see it in older articles, it makes the Foundation look stupid and unprofessional, plus it’s a big tone-breaker. 
 Ideas Done Well Enough that You Can (probably) Only Write a Bad Copy 
 4. Things what make other weird things. This includes things what make SCPs and Things what you put other things in and they come out improved. 
 We have SCP-914, SCP-294, SCP-261, and SCP-212. It’s going to be tough to add something of this type that won’t seem like a bad knock-off. 
 14. Things what lead to some vast dimension of pointlessness where we lose countless amounts of D-Class by sending them in for no particular reason. 
 We have SCP-093, SCP-967, and the experiment log from SCP-354. If you write a new dimensional portal to explore, it’s going to have to be damn interesting to survive. 
 15. Statues what move when you dun look at dem. We already have one what does that and it's better than what you can write. 
 SCP-173, whether or not you think it’s all that great, was the first SCP, and is rated over +1000. Trying to improve on it: Bad idea. 
 17. Things what just tell you random information that be's all mysterious liek. 
 SCP-058 does this better than anything you’re likely to write. 
 99% of the Time, These Are Signs of Weak/Sloppy Writing 
 7. Things what use up excessive resources, like nucular weaponz or Class-D personnel. Blind Guards are excessive resources, by the way. 
 Readers expect the Foundation to come up with reasonable containment procedures, appropriate for the object being contained. Although you can consider the Foundation to have near-unlimited resources, it’s not going to waste them on excessive containment procedures. 
 8. Things what excessively refer to other SCPs. This includes things what are better than other SCPs. 
 Cross-referencing other SCPs is a pet peeve of many readers, especially if it seems gratuitously done to associate your (bad) SCP with a better one. 
 19. Things what caused teh INDIAN OCEAN TSUNAMI. Seriously, I think the Foundation has caused it about ten billion times already. And for that matter, quit making globes and maps that change the world when the map or globe is altered. It gets old. 
 Generally, associating your SCP with real-world events does not go over well, even if done cleverly. 
 6. Things what make you go nuts for no apparent reason. 
 This usually reads as tacked-on danger, as does the SCP which compels people to use it for no good reason. 
 11. Things what perform OTT (Over The Top) as to what they're supposed to do. i.e. Knives what cut through dimensions, audio devices what cause insanity to whoever listens to them etc, etc. 
 These are usually just too obvious and uninteresting to get a good reception. 
 13. Anything what is spherical. Or cubical. Seriously, for fuck sake, pick a random object rather than a shape. 
 This isn't a problem if it actually makes sense for your object to be a sphere or a cube — it's a basketball, or a space probe, or a six-sided die, for example. The problem is when you've thought of a good, weird effect, but couldn’t come up with an appropriate object to produce it. Think harder and you’ll find one… 
 Things We (possibly) Have a Few Too Many of 
 16. Things what is from DA FUTURE! We've got a whole city from there. 
 20. Cats and Dogs. Seriously, we've got way too many canines and felines, let's do something different! Ferrets, lobsters, squids, platypi, muskrats, beavers, komodo dragons, their are millions of animals out there, that are not cats and dogs! 
 22. VINDOWS TO ANOZZER VORLD! Seriously, we have four of them, and they're all the same damn article. Come up with something less stale. 
 23. Creepy dolls. 'Nuff said. 
 Before you write one of these up, do a search on the existing ones and ask yourself: Is mine really doing something different or more interesting than what we already have? If you can sincerely say yes, then go write it… 
 Someone occasionally suggests a new topic for the cliche list — Parasites. Creatures that pretend to be ordinary objects, and then kill you. Dice. There are over 4000 SCPs on the site, so it's worthwhile to do a search and ask in the Forum or Chat to see if your idea has already been done, no matter what it is. 
 A Final Note 
 This is not a checklist of things to try to add together and make into one (-J) SCP. It's been done (and deleted) several times.""",,+160,active,essay joke,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//cliches-and-you-an-educational-film
,"""Dr. Mackenzie's Guide to Author Stereotypes""","""By popular request, I am creating this list of bad author stereotypes in order to enlighten the community. If it's not clear enough by the tone of writing, you do not want to be one of these. :) 
 Disclaimer: This document is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek analysis of common types of bad newbies. None of these are targeted at any particular person, and is meant to be entertaining, not offensive. 
 I do not and will not condone the use of these stereotypes against site members. If you do so, you will likely be reprimanded and/or banned by staff for rudeness towards other members. Again, this is not intended to make fun of specific people or groups, and is intended expressly for humor. 
 - Mackenzie 
 I suck at writing, but it's the only thing I can do. I hate my life. 
 Emo Teenagers appear in all forms, from the obvious to the subtle. While a SCP based on Linkin Park lyrics is pretty much unmistakable, this stereotype generally applies to any author who positively oozes depression and angst. Emos will often times try to draw sympathy by demeaning themselves, or claiming that no one understands them or their horrible, horrible life situation. When their site submission bombs out, you'll also generally see something along the lines of: 
 I'm sorry I suck so much. I'm gonna go kill myself now. 
 There's something to be said for being honest and humble when you first start writing in a community with such high standards as the SCP Foundation, but there's a limit to how much of this you can get away with before you start annoying everyone. As I've mentioned in my Documentation Guidelines before, the SCP Foundation's authors tend to be on the mature side, with the average age of authors well over 20. If you are a teenager (and especially one suffering from angst issues), this is probably not the site for you. We aren't here to listen to your whining, and you're not going to find sympathy by telling everyone how awful everything is. 
 Note: Yes, I have actually seen someone threaten to kill themselves when their SCP got downvoted. If you are in this boat, then you need serious help. Immediately. 
 Empathy Level: 3/10 - A lot of us have been there before, but that doesn't make it an excuse.
Annoyance Level: 5/10 - Those of us who have been there don't like to be reminded of it. Thankfully the rule ""Don't Feed the Trolls"" works just fine here, and will eventually drag themselves to more sympathetic environments once you starve them out.
Redeemability: 1/10 - You generally can't do anything about them. They'll either grow out of it (making it a self-fixing problem) or go elsewhere. Like MySpace. 
 Why can't we just use an antimatter-powered titanium magnet to keep it contained? 
 Not every member of this community is a renowned rocket scientist or biologist. However, most of us are college students or college graduates, and are therefore fairly intelligent. Most importantly, those of us who write here have a pretty good grasp of basic mathematics, scientific process, and how to do research on a topic when we don't fully understand it. The Dropout is someone who is not only determined to write a speculative science based SCP despite being horribly unqualified, but has not done any of the homework either. The following are fairly good indications that you may have stumbled onto a half-baked abomination left behind by such an author: 
 As a corollary, a Dropout may also be someone who believes that domain knowledge is somehow genetic: 
 My father is a physicist, so I obviously know what I'm talking about. 
 Empathy Level: 2/10 - While sometimes honest mistakes slip through, most of the things on the list that qualify you for true Dropout status are completely mindbogglingly inexcusable.
Annoyance Level: 9/10 - Few things shatter suspension of disbelief more reliably or completely than bad science.
Redeemability: 2/10 - Very, very rarely these kids can be taught some real science, but more often the only solution is to wait until they actually graduate from school. 
 Hey guys, I just got accepted to the site 15 minutes ago, so here's my first SCP. 
 We here who are major contributors to the SCP Foundation understand and enjoy the fact that people get really excited about the Foundation. After all, for some of us here, this is practically our major obsession and we love that other people love it. We love to see people speculate, and we love to see people come up with more ideas on how the site and the community can be contributed to or improved. 
 What worries us, however, is when a fresh newbie barrels down on our site, heedless of advice, and slams into the community with a poorly conceived, poorly written and usually error-filled piece of writing that looks like it fell out of the Tree of Bad Ideas and hit every branch on the way down. If you are imagining a bullet-ridden Zero with its pilot screaming ""BANZAI!"" at the top of his lungs at this point, then you are getting the right idea. 
 The moral of the story is that the Foundation values quality over all else. Please take the time to read through all of the required and relevant guides and essays that relate to your idea. Bounce your ideas and drafts off of the community first, and above all take their advice when given, especially from established authors. We are more than willing to help you get off the ground, but you have to help yourself as well. 
 Note: As I like to say in the discussion threads of failed articles, ""When you post to the main series you are asking for summary judgment, not feedback."" Feedback is what happens before you post a final draft. 
 Empathy Level: 1/10 - Before you were accepted to the Foundation, you should have read all of the guides first. This level of haphazard writing is inexcusable.
Annoyance Level: 6/10 - Thankfully, people who fly their work into the site at top speed rarely come back for a second round.
Redeemability: 3/10 - Once in a blue moon you can calm one of these kids down, but the degree to which their asses are on fire usually causes them to either burn out or crash hard. 
 Hey everyone. I'm a fantasy writer and I think that SCP would be so much cooler if we changed the format and tone around a bit. 
 An interesting twist or unique hook is one of the best ways to make your writing stand out and give it the best chance of sticking. Being different in this regard is anything but bad. 
 However, that doesn't mean that there aren't universal, inviolable rules when it comes to writing SCPs. Writing completely out of format (when there isn't a legitimate reason for doing so), implying a completely different organizational structure for the Foundation (such as Class-Ds being something other than death row convicts who are used as cannon fodder), or completely failing to follow the clinical tone and technical writing that is the trademark of the Foundation is a sure sign that someone simply does not know where and when to conform to the collaborative project. When someone does this, this breaks the tone of an article (and subsequently the reader's suspension of disbelief). 
 A Type I Non-Sequitur is someone who is a victim of simple naivete, and doesn't know any better. A Type II Non-Sequitur is someone who knows the difference and where they went wrong and simply does not care; they want to ""reform"" the site for the ""better"" and doesn't seem to care what anyone else thinks. 
 Empathy Level: 5/10 - This is apparently surprisingly easy to do when you have looked at hundreds of failed submissions. The best solution to the problem is to simply read more of the site before trying your hand at contributing.
Annoyance Level: 4/10 - Most people who make mistakes like this are simply ignorant of the standards, and are usually pretty civil when informed and corrected.
Redeemability: 6/10 - A Type I can be redeemed with a decent amount of work, but Type IIs are generally completely unrepentant and their short career with the SCP Foundation will generally end when they quit out of frustration or are summarily banned. 
 Everyone I know says I'm a great writer. 
 A close relative to the Emo Teen, the Special Snowflake has been told by everyone that they are an awesome author. This includes their teachers, their parents, their friends, all their followers on DeviantArt… Does anyone else see the problem here? 
 The best kind of feedback is the kind you get from people who are not invested in you. Your friends and teachers are there to support you, do you really honestly think they'll be brutally honest when something you write is truly terrible? Coupled with the aforementioned high standards of the Foundation community, this is a disaster waiting to happen that usually ends with this: 
 Why are you guys being so mean? This is good stuff, it's just a little different. 
 You may also see gems like this once in a while: 
 My [high school] teacher says I write at a college level. I can do just fine without your help. 
 Finally, when confronted with the reality that their SCP has tanked well below -30, we get to see the Rage State of the Special Snowflake: 
 [expletive] you all! I'm going back to [insert amateur art/writing gallery here] where they aren't assholes. 
 Empathy Level: 4/10 - When you're young and you haven't taken hard hits yet, it's not easy to know the difference between friendly sympathy and true feedback.
Annoyance Level: 7/10 - Unfortunately, these kids tend to stray just shy of the line at which actual administrative action can be taken against them. Thankfully, these kids tend to not come back unless they are malicious at heart, thus making them a one-time problem.
Redeemability: 3/10 - Sometimes you can convince a Snowflake to take a deep breath and learn to take honest feedback, but they usually wander back to the holes they crawled out of. On the plus side, Snowflake Rage States are hilarious to watch. 
 These stereotypes aren't significant enough to warrant their own heading, but still merit mention. 
 Yeah, well… I’m gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers.
— Bender, Futurama episode #2, ""The Series Has Landed"" 
 Named for the character from Futurama, a Bender is someone who, after failing repeatedly to successfully contribute to the SCP Wiki, decides to create their own offshoot site (with or without blackjack and hookers) and invites everyone else to join and contribute to it. 
 The SCP community is one with a long, storied history, built on the shoulders of administrators and staff who are not only great writers, but who are dedicated to keeping the site running smoothly. It takes a lot of effort to keep the system going, so it should go without saying that someone who is too impatient to meet said standards stands little chance of making an offshoot work. Most of these crash within weeks if not days, as the people involved decide it's not worth the effort. 
 Note: The successful off-shoots of the SCP Wiki, such as the Wanderer's Library and Global Occult Coalition, were all started and run by existing administrators of the SCP Wiki. 
 Here at the SCP Foundation, being a writing website, we encourage newbies to be inventive and creative. If you've been here any amount of time, you'll have noticed that SCPs that are too similar to existing ones tend to be panned. We want to see new things, unique takes on the paranormal, and most importantly SCPs that stand on their own without leaning on existing canon. 
 The Coat-tail Rider takes two forms. The first is the author who has literally never written anything on their own. They will go on for hours about new and inventive ways of killing SCP-682, exciting things to do with SCP-914, and debate endlessly about how we could decommission or at least make SCP-173 safer. The first type may even go as far as writing a tale based exclusively on a popular SCP, but never comes up with their own original content. 
 The second form is the author who writes a mediocre SCP, then immediately cross-links it to no fewer than half a dozen other SCPs. This usually takes the form of ""suggest testing against these SCPs"" or more rarely ""never let these SCPs come together"". A more extreme version is the author that actually edits the existing popular SCP without permission and adds a backlink to his own article. 
 Members and Contributors of the SCP Foundation come from all over the world and from all walks of life. It's not unreasonable that everyone has different tastes and favorite things. What is annoying, however, is when your major obsession is the only thing you ever talk about. 
 Hey, did I mention that I really love [insert fandom here]? Is anyone else a [insert fandom here] fan? Why isn't there a [insert fandom here] SCP yet? Someone should write one. 
 These newbies can range from specific fandoms to broad genres, but either way will eventually get on everyone's nerves with their incessant talk about nothing but their particular obsession. If you see a SCP that is a magical extradimensional phone booth or a bunch of spheres that can summon and unsummon monsters that fight for you, then you are well within your right to be suspicious. 
 A sub-type of the Fanboy/Fangirl is one whose fandom is directed at a site member. These are the ones who think that Bright/Clef/Kondraki is the most awesome person in the history of ever and who cannot and will not fail to brown nose their idol at every opportunity. While not nearly as directly annoying as a normal Fanboy/Fangirl (except maybe to their idol), they are still nonetheless awkward to deal with and leave you feeling dirty afterwards. 
 Writer-Clef here, just wanted to chime in: I've encountered several Character-Clef fans before, and almost without exception, they are all incredibly annoying. Usually because they a. confuse me with my character and gush about how awesome I was in blah blah blah, or b. end up Draco in Leather Pantsing Clef to the point where I don't even recognize the character they are writing about. 
 If you like my writing, then by all means, compliment it. If you want to give feedback about my writing, then by all means, tell me what rules and what sucks. If you just want to gush about how cool it was when Clef and Dmitri hit the road and show me your fanart of your OC and Clef in their love nest, then keep it to yourself, deep in the secret corners of your heart where true love blooms and I don't have to see it… unless it's really funny, then you can send it to my Tumblr. 
 From the page About the SCP Foundation: 
 Our Goals 
 One of the most obnoxious types of newbie is the one who's strongly opinionated and is determined to downvote anything that isn't ""scary"" or ""creepy"". While it's true that the ones that stick with you the best are the ones that make you a little nervous at night, there's nothing that says a SCP has to be creepy. Some of the best SCPs on the site are simply inexplicable; we don't understand how they work, and they leave you wildly speculating. Don't be the annoying person who automatically downvotes something just because it doesn't scare you. 
 Here at the SCP Foundation, we value honest criticism from all members, whether you are an author or not. Obviously if you've got a few popular SCPs under your belt then people are more liable to respect you, but you don't have to be an artist to be an art critic and even newbies can have good advice sometimes. 
 What does not go over well is when someone drops really, really bad advice and makes it look like it's an authoritative opinion. Something like: 
 This is okay, but what it really needs is some cross-testing with SCP-173 and SCP-682 and a couple of test logs. You need to put in some humor to contrast the seriousness too, maybe have someone accidentally kill a bunch of researchers. 
 Note: If you don't know why this is bad advice, then you really, really need to go back and read the guides again. 
 Closely related to the Coat-tails Rider, the Outsourcer is the same problem from a different direction. Rather than simply ride on others' work, the Outsourcer writes the bare minimum of what's necessary to create a SCP, leaves it in an unpolished state, and expects the community to finish it for them. 
 Contrary to popular belief, the SCP Foundation is not a wiki in the traditional sense, where every article has a dozen hands in it. We want to see your writing, your vision, and if you don't have a fully fleshed out article, then we'd prefer that you keep it to yourself until it's ready for prime-time. 
 Signs of an Outsourcer include: 
 If you have any ideas on how to improve this, feel free to edit it. 
 As well as: 
 I like that idea. Could you write that in for me? 
 To reiterate: A collaborative effort is one in which one or more people have established a firm foundation for a concept that could be expanded upon within the framework that has been established. If you don't even have anything to stand on in the first place but you want others to finish it for you, that's flat out laziness. 
 Closely related to The Bender, The Visionary is someone who doesn't just want to contribute to the Foundation, but wants to do so in a way that no one else has done before. Writing a SCP or crafting a tale isn't enough; they want to go big or go broke: books, movies, video games, or other major projects involving multiple people, hundreds of hours of effort, and often times even publishing deals. 
 The problem is, these are people who can't write, and these project proposals are their last-ditch attempt at stirring up enthusiasm after their first (or even first several) writing submissions are panned by the community. They often have little to no experience in their supposed field of creative expertise, have nothing other than the most rudimentary of teaser material if at all, and in the most blatant cases, don't even have a plot or story in mind; in these cases they may even ask for ideas. 
 Now, this isn't to say that it's not possible to make off-shoot creative projects based on the Foundation; there is a long and storied history of such projects receiving — in some cases — more attention than the Foundation itself, such as the SCP Containment Breach computer game. In almost all these cases, however, there are skilled pilots at the helm of the projects, and they know better than to sell vaporware; that is, to show off their projects before they have anything to show. The Visionary specifically refers to individuals who are quite blatantly simply talking the talk in order to draw attention to themselves (and away from their lack of writing ability).""",,+172,active,essay joke,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//mackenzie-stereotypes
,"""ROUNDERHOUSE EXTREMELY GOOD AND OFFICIAL GUIDE TO BEING A SHITTY CRITTER""","""There's lots of essays and guides out there about how to be a good critter who helps produce good articles for the site. But what about those of us who aspire for something else? Those of us who just want to kick puppies, see the world burn, cause problems on purpose, et cetera? 
 I've done and received a lot of critique on my time on this site. A lot of it sucked, mostly the critique I gave out early on. I like to think I've improved, but some might say I still suck at critique, which really just makes me the most qualified person to write this. 
 Critique is a sacrosanct give-and-take relationship between the author and the reader, but you're not here for that. You're here to learn exactly what moves you can make so that absolutely nobody will like or listen to the critique you do give, regardless of the actual content. If you give something rotten, the author won't take it, and the cycle falls apart, just as us chaotic evils desire. 
 Ah, the classic. This one's a must-do for any prospective Bad Critter. You can have the most analytic, insightful, and most importantly, valid critique on an article, and absolutely no one will listen to any of it if you simply couch it in the most pretentious, self-important, ""heed my wisdom"" tone you can possibly muster. 
 There is not an author on the site that enjoys being talked down to, treated like they're stupid for having written something. Being nice and open to communication risks them actually listening to your critique, so we minimize this by being huge pricks. This comes naturally to many of us, but you have to really exercise the muscle: here's a quick translation guide you can use to make your critique as pompous as possible! 
 See how the second column is instantly far more alienating to the author, despite both having approximately the same message? That's what we're gunning for. The common adage is not to take crit personally, but a significant and unacknowledged part of that responsibility is laid on the critter not to make their crit personal, to keep it distanced and relaxed. If you break that and start borderline-insulting the author, you'll know you've made it. If you look closer at the columns, you'll also notice a subtle difference… 
 Find it yet? Column 2 establishes that the critter believes their opinion of the article is a fact by using declarative statements and bold language, while Column 1 is some snowflake shit about what the critter ""feels"" and ""thinks"". This is a good rule of thumb to remember: you're not just a guy with an opinion. You have been blessed to have the ONLY correct opinion on this article, and you have a moral imperative to explain how your reading is objective fact to the silly author. 
 Occasionally, you'll find critters that acknowledge both the parts of the articles they liked and that they disliked. This is, and I do not say this lightly, literally worse than racism. 
 Do not ever give the impression that you enjoyed any part of the article. To be a true Bad Critter, you must only acknowledge the parts of the articles that you hated with every fiber of your being, and then talk at length about how much they blowed, like so: 
 Actionable critique is better understood with a context of what does and doesn't work in an article. I.e; generally informing the author which aspects of the article worked along with which didn't helps them get a better understanding for next time. So, naturally, we have to make sure to not accidentally leave a compliment anywhere in our comments. 
 Well done, you've established that the author is stupid actually and that their article has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The logical conclusion is that this piece of shit can't be saved, so tell the gremlin-author the next best thing: you have this great idea for how they could fix this article. It's a bit of a departure from what they have but you really think this would do better in getting their meani- 
 You get the point. Basically take a six-gauge drill to their cranium, poke a straw in, and start whispering into their frontal lobe how this idea is really neat dude. Of course, don't offer to collab with them, that would be presumptuous. Merely tell them exactly what article to write next time so they listen to your wisdom and don't fuck it up like the clumsy hairless ape that they are. 
 Say someone wrote some fluffy piece about characters and feelings and being sad in containment. There's obviously nothing good about this, except maybe the anomaly has a neat super power. This would be a great time to suggest a super-hero style article, where our anomaly is fighting bad guys alongside the foundation, because this is obviously the only way to save what little good the author has lucked into. 
 This is a great one people do all the time without even realizing it - they head into the article with the sole intent of deconstructing it. If you're aiming for Bad Crit, this is a fantastic trick - you instantly lose any chance of enjoying the article in earnest because you're primed to look for mechanical faults and failings. Ultimately the sole goal of any article should make sure the reader enjoys reading it. If you enjoy the article, even if it has a bunch of mechanical failures, then it's a success. 
 So obviously going in with the intent of not enjoying the article at all puts you at an edge. This is also good because it's a monumentally difficult mindset to pull yourself out from. Enjoying articles is hard, which is why many people who have done a lot of writing just don't do it. 
 There are a lot of reasons. When you read your own drafts to look for problems, you start finding them in others articles when you could just be looking at the end product. When you see an article by someone you've read bad articles from before, you're naturally primed to dislike it. Even the most superficial things like CSS themes or formatting can influence our outlook while reading an article. 
 Obviously you should let these things all influence you, rather than the content of the actual article. That's very true and important. 
 Sometimes you'll come across a rare kind of article that you simply cannot reasonably find fault with. No article is perfect, but these bastards come pretty damn close, which means most of the usual meaningless fluff we put into crit can't possibly apply. Anything you say will be wrong at best and widely clowned on at worst. 
 The winning move here is not to play at all. Simply leave a boilerplate comment expressing your distaste and/or explaining your vote and quickly close the tab so you aren't exposed to good writing for a nanosecond more than you need to be. To that end, I've compiled this handy chart of boilerplate vote-explanation comments you can use if you ever read such an article: 
 * And then forget to vote on the article. 
 This is always, always preferable to just not saying anything at all. 
 Damn, you can say whatever mean-ass shit you want for themes! Literally nobody cares, it's crazy! 
 If you haven't figured it out by now, this is a joke. It's making fun of a lot of the critique I've done on the site, as well as a lot of critique I've seen. This is not meant to attack anyone in particular, other than myself. My point is obviously the exact opposite of these things; we should all try to be nicer, more courteous, and fairer with the reads and critiques that we all give. I know I fuck that up too often, but hopefully getting a laugh at myself will help someone else think twice before they posted that comment.""","""Figure 1.1""",+180,active,_cc essay joke,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//rounderhouse-critique-guide

 12. Things what are ancient and evil, so vast that humankind cannot comprehend it, yada yada yada you can only have so many. 
 13. Anything what is spherical. Or cubical. Seriously, for fuck sake, pick a random object rather than a shape. 
 14. Things what lead to some vast dimension of pointlessness where we lose countless amounts of D-Class by sending them in for no particular reason. 
 15. Statues what move when you dun look at dem. We already have one what does that and it's better than what you can write. 
 16. Things what is from DA FUTURE! We've got a whole city from there. 
 17. Things what just tell you random information that be's all mysterious liek. 
 18. Things what is indestructable just to be indestructable. We're the Special CONTAINMENT Procedures, not Special DESTRUKTION Procedures Foundation. We usually dun destroy things just to destroy them nowadays. 
 19. Things what caused teh INDIAN OCEAN TSUNAMI. Seriously, I think the Foundation has caused it about ten billion times already. And for that matter, quit making globes and maps that change the world when the map or globe is altered. It gets old. 
 20. Cats and Dogs. Seriously, we've got way too many canines and felines, let's do something different! Ferrets, lobsters, squids, platypi, muskrats, beavers, komodo dragons, their are millions of animals out there, that are not cats and dogs! 
 21. Humorous addenda talking about some shenanigan the staff did and what terrible punishment awaits if they do it again We are trying to move away from such things. 
 22. VINDOWS TO ANOZZER VORLD! Seriously, we have four of them, and they're all the same damn article. Come up with something less stale. 
 23. Creepy dolls. 'Nuff said. 
 If you be making one of these things as an SCP, plz to be remembering dat we already have OVER NINE THOUSAND of these things already, and your entry will be harshly scrutinized and mocked. Your article better do a magic trick and practically give the reader a blowjob to avoid being BALEETED. 
 Translation: You are welcome to attempt to use these ideas, but bear in mind you will be adding to an already well-stocked collection, will come under harsher scrutiny, and need to do exceedingly well to make a impression. 
 Dr. Gears Footnote: With these things being stated, let us also state that this is not a list of ""NO MORE OF THESE EVER"", but a list of things that we have too much of. You can try to make a Thing What Let You Fight Good, but bear in mind it's going to have to be VERY good to both stand out from the pack, and avoid deletion. If you attempt to make something that fits into one of these slots, be prepared for a rapid downward spiral and deletion. 
 If, on the other hand, you're able to re-forge one of these cliches into something truly original and solid, congratulations. However this situation is very much the exception, not the rule.

 Addendum XXXX.1: Supplementary Materials""",,+573,active,_cc essay joke,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//your-very-first-scp
Joke SCPs,"""Tales Edition""","""Ever wish you could find all the works featuring your favorite SCPs? Well, now you can! This is meant to be an easy way to access such content for fans, writers, and other interested parties. This is to be an ever-evolving list, so do feel free to add missing entries should you come across them. 
 Do's and Don'ts for inclusion: 
 Do Include: 
 Do Not Include: 
 How-To's for inclusion: 
 When an SCP has multiple entries, please attempt to order them by relevancy, if at all possible. So: 
 The Tale is about the SCP —-> The SCP appears in this Tale —> The SCP is heavily referenced within the Tale —> The SCP is briefly alluded to within the Tale 
 It's not a hard-and-fast rule (one is not expected to read EVERY 173 tale to know where to slot the next one). This is merely a courtesy to readers. 
 When linking series: A link to the hub page or first chapter should suffice if the SCP in question appears in multiple entries or is central to the series. A link to individual Tales in a series should be used in cases where the SCP is focused on in a single chapter. 
 (For instance. SCP-012 is the primary focus of the On Mount Golgotha canon, so I linked to the canon hub. SCP-339, on the other hand, is featured prominently in the On Mount Golgotha tale ""An Impenitent Thief"", so I linked that tale instead of the whole canon). 
 Multiple SCPs: When there are multiple SCPs in a given work, it's fine to include the work under each SCP, not just one or two. 
 Formatting entries: 
 Tale entries should be nested underneath their respective SCPs, on a tier separate from the main bullet-points. Place a space before the asterisk to accomplish this. Tales should be in triple-brackets. If the url and the title of the page are different, the entry should have the url first, followed by a vertical bar, followed by the title. 
 For example: 
 * [[[SCP-106]]] - The Old Man
 * [[[The Young Man]]] 
 The Tale has a space before the asterisk, and is properly nested. The page title and the page url are the same, so the link is good. 
 * [[[SCP-359]]] - The Hawk
 * [[[i-wanna-be-the-very-best|SCPokemon]]] 
 Here, the url and page title are different. This entry includes the url, followed by a vertical bar, followed by the page title. Another good link. 
 Parentheticals may be used next to individual submissions to further lend insight on contents (for example ""(Poetry)"" or ""(Tale Series)"". Please try to label adult content in this manner: 
 Tale (Adult) 
 And that's it! Let's get this rolling.""",,,active,collaboration hub,https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com//joke-scps-tales-edition
