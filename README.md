# SCP Scraping and Analysis
Scraping articles from the SCP Foundation and analysing the results. 
Includes all articles in the main series 1 through 7 that were available at the time of scraping, as well as a collection of joke SCPs, in a separate file.

Data collected using Python, BeautifulSoup and httplib2, using a limited number of requests per minute.

Based on the contents of the SCP Wiki, which can be found [here](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). Many thanks to the many authors who contributed to the wiki. Each row contains a link back to the original work. 

Main series dataset available by itself [here](https://www.kaggle.com/czzzzzzz/scp1to7)
