SCP-231-7 is to be kept at an undisclosed location. All personnel assigned to SCP-231 will be transported there blindfolded from Site-19 by a route including no fewer than seven different forms of transportation, including but not limited to aircraft, automobile, underground tunnel, and ████████████. Removal of the blindfold during the transport process is grounds for immediate termination.\\nthe princess in the tower is hidden far away. but nothing under heaven can keep The Groom at bay.\\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-231-7 must undergo heavy psychological testing before being cleared to enter the site.

Normal psychological screening procedures against Axis II disorders are waived, so long as the Class-D personnel in question has the mental capacity to carry out Procedure 110-Montauk as needed.\\nLuke 23:34.\\nPersonnel who express sympathy towards SCP-231-7\\'s plight and/or express a desire to rescue or sympathize towards SCP-231-7 will be transferred to another project without delay. Any actual rescue attempts will be met with immediate termination. Personnel who have served on the staff of SCP-231-7\\'s Containment Team are not required to divulge that information to others.

Violent criminals are not to be used for this purpose due to the possibility of accidental fatality during the 110-Montauk process. \\n Special Containment Procedures: Following repeated escape and suicide attempts, and based on the failure of containment for SCP-231-1 through 6, containment of SCP-231-7 has been amended to the following: SCP-231 is to be contained within a soundproof holding cell, adjacent to holding cells for six Class D Personnel assigned for the purposes of Procedure 110-Montauk. Cameras will monitor every inch of the cell at all times, and must be manned 24 hours a day. Malfunctioning monitoring equipment will be replaced without delay by psychologically screened staff. Doors will be magnetically locked, openable only by positive action by the control and monitoring facility. This includes all doors linking the main holding cell to those of the six Class D Personnel. \\n SCP-231-7 is to be kept restrained to a hospital bed at all times except for the purposes of Procedure 110-Montauk.

Following the procedure, all Class D Personnel must return to their holding cells or explosive collars will be detonated.\\nthe cretin moon no more is howling, gone its mourning black. in their dreams its face is prowling, come to take them back.\\n[DATA EXPUNGED PER ORDER OF O5-██ ON ██-██-████.

Foundation Personnel immediately took possession of remaining SCPs 231-2 through 231-7 and, based on notebooks recovered from the cult, instituted Procedure 110-Montauk to prevent future occurrences. the hens were in the henhouse and seven eggs did lay, till the fox crept in by dark of night and stole the eggs away. \\n Addendum 231-a: Current Status of SCP-231 units.\\nsix were broken by their bindings six no more shall sing. comes the seventh full unwinding and all the bells will ring. \\n Addendum 231-b: Text of missive by O5-██ \\n Dear Friends, \\n It has come to my attention that recently, certain rumors have surfaced regarding SCP-231. Due to the drop in staff morale, I have decided to address some of the more prevalent points. \\n One final note: The Foundation does many distasteful things in the completion of our mission, but our mission is important enough that the price is one we must pay. Containment of SCP-231 is one of our most dangerous duties, not because of any direct danger to ourselves (like SCP-682) but because of the danger that our resolve will fail, that we will allow ourselves to either let down our guard due to sympathy for the suffering of an innocent, or that we will allow ourselves to become monsters through the performance of monstrous acts. Just do your jobs, and save the philosophizing for the shrink. \\n Sincerely,\\nO5-██\\nDon\\'t believe it when they say they\\'re trying to save her. Why would they bother? They\\'ve got exactly what they want exactly where they want it. \\n Addendum 231-c: Update \\n 231-07\\'s emotional response to Procedure 110-Montauk appears to be reduced recently, despite proper execution of said procedure, increasing danger of SCP-██ undergoing a ████████████ event. Two options have been proposed. \\n 1. Development of a new containment procedure with higher emotional response than Procedure 110-Montauk. \\n 2. Administration of a Class A Amnestic to SCP-231-7, allowing for a return to base emotional response state. Said memory modification is to be administered during execution of Procedure 110-Montauk to maintain heightened emotional state following memory reset. \\n Please advise.\\nthe doctor never tells his god which one he really seeks. instead he hides himself away, and quietly, he weeps.\\nDr. ████ \\n Addendum 231-d: Decision\\nProverbs 1:32\\nCarry out Option 2 at the first available opportunity.\\ntheir god\\'s own voice, he makes the choice, declaring with their word. \"in fear and pain let her remain, lest she be like the third.\"\\nO5-██ \\n Addendum 231-e: Aftermath\\nEzekiel 6:14\\nOption 2 was carried out.

In fact, it is better to delay for some time before re-administering the agent. Analysis of Subject 231-7\\'s emotional response indicates that efficacy of Procedure 110-Montauk seems to peak between the third and fourth performance of the procedure: the dread of anticipation of events seems to heighten emotional response for a time, before familiarity with the procedure begins to lessen the efficacy of treatment. My recommendation is that Class A Amnestics be administered once a week during Procedure 110-Montauk. The calendar has been modified accordingly.\\nher memory a fickle thing, the strongest shall endure. when her weeping starts to waver, their drugs make her mind pure.\\nDr. ██████████ \\n For a list of all works by this author, click here. \\n « SCP-230 | SCP-231 | SCP-232 »\"', 'SCP-597': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-597 \\n Item #: SCP-597 \\n Object Class: Euclid \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-597 is to be guarded and researched by a rotating monthly shift. Those in charge of the design of the containment procedures are not allowed contact with the SCP; if at all possible this duty should be left to overseer level personnel. No one is to be allowed to view (on video or through a window) or be in the same room as SCP-597 for longer than five hours. Maintenance personnel are to alternate every day. \\n Evaluations are to be given at the end of the shift or whenever mental distress seems obvious. If psychological contamination is too great and poses a tangible danger, termination can be performed immediately by the on-site analyst. (The mental health offices are soundproofed for this purpose.) The doctor can terminate up to ten individuals at a time; any more requires the approval of an overseer. In this scenario, procedure 597-32 (Weaning the Babies) is to be activated. Vents in the ceiling require regular maintenance for this purpose. \\n Smoke detectors are not to be turned off for any reason; candles and incense lit in 597\\'s cell are to be taken as an indication of a dangerous obsession. The leaving and offering of food, as 597 does not require it, is to be viewed in the same light as well. All other signs of unnatural love and religious awe are to be reported along with these. \\n The room and the surrounding area are to be sealed, with ventilation shafts, plumbing, and wiring checked daily. Measures are to be put into place for the continuous extermination of all vermin in the facility. Animals not part of the study found suckling on SCP-597 are to be removed and terminated as soon as possible due to risk of biological contamination. Because of this, in the morning, workers must wear Hazmat suits while entering the cell, for SCP-597 is often covered in vermin, including mice, opossums, squirrels, and bats. \\n 597 is to be hosed down weekly, with special care given to the areas around the nipples, to prevent the buildup of saliva and drool. Those suckling need washing daily, as does the floor underneath them, for the removal of the puddles of urine, feces (for the first few days, but when solids completely leave the body this is no longer necessary, although occasionally a thin watery substance is excreted), and vomit, which is produced when they drink too eagerly, quickly, or out of rhythm. The cleaning products are to be plain and unscented (use of aromatics or herbal oils will be noted) and no scrubbing is to be done by hand. \\n Description: SCP-597 is a blob of flesh approximately 5.8m (19ft) high, and 10.67m (35ft) wide, although this measurement changes slightly when it moves, or the substances expand and ripple. All over its body, mostly located on its rolls, are hundreds and hundreds of teats, of various colors and sizes. Whenever a mammal is released into its cell, it will be drawn to the corresponding teat for its species and then proceed to suckle as long as they are unimpeded. The milk released will be identical in every way to the makeup of the subject\\'s mother\\'s, although able to sustain the subject\\'s nutritional needs indefinitely. While the fluid is the same as normal milk chemically, for some reason, whether it be an effect of the SCP or an unknown quality of the substances it excretes, any full-grown mammal that would normally require more can survive to the end of their normal lifespan give or take a few years, simply by suckling at the nipple, although their teeth will fall out, their muscle will atrophy due to lack of use (the subjects will curl up as close as possible on the side, lay under the SCP [there have been reports of suffocation], or immerse themselves and dive into the flesh itself) and stomach problems are presented because of the all-liquid diet. \\n Milk taken in a bottle does not have the same results, although those already affected by SCP-597 will fall under a quasi-hypnotic hold when presented with a container, will do anything to possess it, and find drinking it very gratifying. \\n Those in charge of bottling the liquid have the urge to use a rubber teat for feeding babies as a cover, even when a normal lid will suffice, and will attempt to do so even when informed that it is in violation of dangerous materials protocol, not being an airtight seal. \\n The urge to suckle is a mental, physical, and sexual compulsion. While lower lifeforms cannot resist its effects at all, humans can, although they experience great difficulty. Those in SCP-597\\'s presence describe it as a \"mental pull\" leading us to the conclusion that it is partially telepathic, although it also obviously appeals to deep instincts and is hormonal as well; endorphins associated with breast-feeding and maternal comfort are released. Those who do give in do so in a mad rush, all restraint broken at once, or a slow ritual, commonly involving bowing, kneeling, crawling, and chanting. They are reduced quickly to an infantile state, and within one hour lose all linguistic abilities, intellectual capabilities, and willpower. Before complete loss of brain function it is said to be highly comforting and pleasurable, and they say they feel safe, \"like never before\". Before and after contact is made, there are reports of strong feelings associated with vague images and recollections and sensations, all traced back to the womb or crib, often centered around remembrance of their parents\\' smell and facial appearance. [DATA EXPUNGED] █████ ███████████████ █████ █████ █████ ██ retarded blind [DATA EXPUNGED] permanently attached [DATA EXPUNGED] \\n [DATA EXPUNGED] \\n Those who watch are also influenced, although in lesser or different ways. Increased pettiness, regression to childish states, extreme immaturity, decreased bowel control, fetishization, promiscuity, and even reports of public masturbation have all been noted. Staff\\'s IQ, focus, and rationality all drop significantly over a period of time with SCP-597, and they often will fight with each other over silly things, such as objects or perceived insults, be wracked with laughing and crying fits, be unable to resolve problems in an adult way, and lose the ability to control their emotions. After four to five weeks, it is impossible for them to function in a work setting, and they all communicate with each other with a series of grunts, coos, and short confused sentences. Attention should also be paid to the fact that the employees\\' name for the object degenerates from the official title, \"SCP-597\" to \"The Mother\", then to just \"Mother\", then \"Mom\", \"Mommy\", \"Mum\", and so forth, often ending in sucking, blowing, or kissing sounds as the representation. Also of interest is that almost immediately strong oral fixations will develop or resurface. Those who quit smoking will start again (100% occurrence) and the chewing of gum, snacking, gluttony, nail and lip biting, and hair chewing, rises as well, almost to the point of psychosis; there are deadly weight gains, choking incidents, balls or clumps of human material obstructing the digestive system, murders over food (the vending machine is often completely empty), and dental and health problems. Doctors and personnel in the area of effect, even those entering for a few moments will find themselves absentmindedly putting something in their mouth without realizing it. Observation of the employees in their homes or private lives also reveals [DATA EXPUNGED], often to the point of only being aroused by [DATA EXPUNGED] \\n Men with already unstable or fragile egos find a strengthening in Oedipal complexes, often to dangerous levels; three employees have raped and murdered [DATA EXPUNGED]. These same personality types also enjoy [DATA EXPUNGED] and request access to SCP-597 for that purpose. Unfortunately, although this behavior is not encouraged, those with this disease are many, too many to take a moral or ideological stance and completely restrict the activity without losing the needed number of workers. A good number are also high-level personnel, although revelation of their identity is forbidden, and requires clearing the area and disabling the camera feeds so they can perform the act (which is not allowed to go over an hour, or separation will cause seizures and homicidal tantrums). Specific procedures for sexual visits can be found in Document 597-XD-12. \\n Addendum-01: ██/ ██/██ See Document 597-XX-23 \\n Document 597-XX-23 \\n Found currently at 597\\'s base and sides are sixty-one specimens suckling.

All water used in containment tanks is to be from an enclosed system separate from any outside system, with all water used being added manually to the system as needed. Tank seals are to be checked daily, with any sign of leakage, wear, or attack being immediately reported to Site Security and repaired. \\n Staff working with or around SCP-695 or the containment area are to be in full Haz-Mat gear at all times. Staff physically handling SCP-695 may do so only in ten minute increments, with a thirty minute break for examination and observation. Staff failing to clear examination are to be removed immediately to quarantine. \\n Any SCP-695 colonies found outside of containment are to be immediately sterilized. Any and all subjects found to be harboring SCP-695 are to be entered into quarantine for observation. Subjects found unsuitable for testing are to be sterilized. \\n Description: SCP-695 appears to be a form of hermaphroditic parasitic eel. SCP-695 has a multiple-stage life cycle that uses human beings as its primary host. Investigation has shown that SCP-695 may be the result of genetic tampering, with several aspects of its physiology, behavior showing evidence of non-natural evolution, and several genetic sequences matching those of SCP-1238, SCP-1340, and SCP-1821. SCP-695 is capable of sustained survival outside of a host, but will seek out a host whenever possible, appearing to rely primarily on smell and electromagnetic sensitivity. \\n Juvenile SCP-695 are between 3 and 5 centimeters long, with an average diameter of 0.5 centimeters, and resemble the adult form, but with fully translucent skin and bones. Adult SCP-695 are between 10 and 15 centimeters in length with a diameter of 2 centimeters. Adults have thin, angular heads with several needle-like teeth, and flat eyes in line with the head. They have several hook-like fins down the length of their body, and can use these for both aquatic and land-based movement, as well as anchoring inside the body. \\n SCP-695 has a set of six glands along the spine, capable of emitting several enzymes and complex molecular compounds that mimic neurochemical signals. These chemicals have a marked effect on the human nervous system, and are capable of blocking and replacing conscious nerve impulses. The correct combination and dosage of these chemicals is still under investigation, but initial tests have shown that these chemicals can “short” and “redirect” action. (Example: Subjects will make a conscious effort to raise their hands, but instead will stand up). These chemicals metabolize within ten minutes without constant injection, and are untraceable by modern medical equipment. The espionage and military applications of these chemicals are currently under investigation. \\n Addendum: \\n Notes on recovery:\\nSCP-695 was initially recovered from ████████, Japan, after reports of an outbreak of “worms” reached the local media. The primary colony of SCP-695 was found [DATA EXPUNGED] freshwater. It appeared that the colony was attempting to migrate into city plumbing and sewage systems, but was prevented due to the topography of the lake. 27 SCP-695, 4 male hosts, and 1 female host were recovered for testing, with the rest destroyed. \\n NOTE: Release of Life Cycle notes is restricted to research staff, those working directly with SCP-695, and those above Level 3 Security Clearance. \\n The SCP-695 Life Cycle:\\nJuvenile SCP-695 exist free-swimming in freshwater lakes and streams. Juvenile SCP-695 will attempt to enter male human hosts when they are present in or around SCP-695 infested waters. SCP-695 will enter the body via the mouth, nose, anus, and urethra. Once inside the body, SCP-695 will infest the nervous and reproductive system and begin gestation into the adult form. This process typically takes between two to three weeks, and coincides with the compromising of the nervous system. \\n Infested subjects will begin to experience twitching, burning, intense thirst, light sensitivity, auditory/visual hallucinations, and increased aggression. Subjects will begin to experience a steady increase in libido, coupled with a swelling of the genitals. SCP-695, after reaching maturity, will begin spawning within the body, with eggs migrating to the urethral canal after being laid. Genital swelling will progressively increase with the build-up of eggs, and cases of tissue rupture have been noted. During the spawning period, SCP-695 will consume blood and nerve tissue from the host body. \\n When an SCP-695 host encounters a human female, SCP-695 will begin to exude several chemical compounds directly to the nervous system and bloodstream. Hosts will experience a massive increase in both aggression and libido, which most often results in the violent assault of the female. Hosts will attempt to sexually violate the female subject, which will cause a release of SCP-695 eggs into the female subject. Hosts will typically release 2-3 liters of eggs before breeding ceases. At the end of breeding, adult SCP-695 will begin to die off. Due to the necrotic tissue inside the host body, and the loss of SCP-695 created chemicals, the host will typically die within 24 hours of the final spawning. \\n SCP-695 eggs entering the female host will migrate to the digestive and reproductive systems. There, they will adhere and begin to gestate, hatching in 48-72 hours. Larval SCP-695 appear as long, thread-like worms between 4-8 centimeters in length, and may be visible in stool or vaginal secretions. SCP-695 will feed on tissues, blood and other body components, causing internal bleeding, abdominal pain, and infection. SCP-695 larvae will reach the juvenile stage after 72 hours, with progressive swelling and extreme discomfort in the abdominal area due to both feeding and physical size increase of the SCP-695. \\n After 72 hours, juvenile SCP-695 will begin exiting the body. In many cases, the physical increase of size by the SCP-695, coupled with feeding, will cause the abdominal area to rupture. SCP-695 will leave via the vaginal, anal, and oral openings if rupture does not occur. Emerging SCP-695 will then feed on the female host for several hours, before propelling themselves on their hook fins to any nearby body of water. \\n SCP-695 are extremely resilient in all life stages, and are capable of indefinite survival in any environment present in the human body. Direct fire application has shown significant success in sterilizing both hosts and SCP-695. \\n Document XR0-od (O5 Review) \\n Due to several accidents involving SCP-695 escape and infestation, further research on their physiology was ordered. Specifically, research was done on both the chemicals created by SCP-695 and the nervous system of SCP-695 itself. \\n It appears that, when in groups of 15 or more units, SCP-695 experiences a marked increase in intelligence. SCP-695 has a very highly developed nervous system for a parasite, and it appears that, with the sufficient amount of individuals, a form of group intelligence is formed. All individuals will stay in very close proximity, most often balling into a single mass, with chemical relays taking place over the skin. \\n This mass is capable of emitting chemical and electromagnetic impulses that can affect the human brain and nervous system. These effects can also run counter to the directed will of the subject. These impulses appear to most commonly manifest as a desire to handle SCP-695, enter and swim in the containment area, or ingest SCP-695. The obvious concerns about this activity have led to an alteration in SCP, and a change in research focus to the isolation and control of the chemical compounds involved. \\n Communication tests have met with limited success. While a form of will or “ego” appears to manifest with increased numbers, the intelligence is difficult to interpret in human terms. It appears reproduction, feeding, and expansion are the primary concerns. There also appears to be a tendency for SCP-695 to attempt to “prolong” its infestation of the human body, even when ready to spawn. It appears the electrochemical aspects of nervous system communication in the human body induce “pleasure” in the SCP-695. \\n Testing is at this point ongoing, with two sets of hosts scheduled for each spawning period. Current data shows that a new and more efficient method of cognitive alteration via SCP-695 chemicals may be viable within the year. \\n « SCP-694 | SCP-695 | SCP-696 »\"', 'SCP-835': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-835 \\n Still image from Recording 81-██ \\n Item #: SCP–835 \\n Object Class: Keter \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-835 is to be monitored and checked daily for new growth. In the event SCP-835 becomes hostile, Suppression Tactic A-A6 is to be immediately implemented until aggressive action ceases. Containment area must be maintained in open ocean, due to the highly aggressive response of SCP-835 to confinement for any length of time. \\n Waste issued by SCP-835 must be immediately collected and contained. Feeding of SCP-835 is to take place twice daily, to consist [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-835 may be moved to a new location twice yearly, provided that the current location is no longer capable of supporting SCP-835, and the move has been approved by Site Command. \\n Staff are to remain at least five meters away from SCP-835. Anyone working near SCP-835 must have safety lines attached to recall winches. Contact with SCP-835 will result in the immediate recall of all staff, and implementation of Suppression Tactic A-A6. Should contact result in full capture of a staff member, SCP-835 is to be monitored constantly until the release of the subject. \\n Description: SCP-835 appears to be a large mass of coral-like polyps weighing ████ tons. The individual polyps are larger than any known coral species, growing to more than one meter in diameter in some cases. The central mass is roughly oval shaped, with a very large (3 meter diameter) polyp at each “end”. SCP-835 is incapable of locomotion, and appears to anchor itself with the large tentacles projected from the SCP-835 polyps. These are also used in feeding, and are coated with a sticky adhesive substance. The tentacles are also quite strong, and have been shown to be capable of damaging plate steel. \\n The “coral” of SCP-835 is extremely hard, requiring high-powered diamond drills to collect even small samples. SCP-835 also grows at a very accelerated rate, capable of adding 22.68kg (50lbs) of mass every day. SCP-835 is susceptible to many chemicals, which cause SCP-835 to “seal up” and halt all growth for 24 hours, prompting the development and use of Suppression Tactic A-A6. Testing has shown [DATA EXPUNGED] \\n SCP-835 emits a large mass of semi-liquid material several times a day from the large polyps on each “end”. This appears to be made of semi-digested solids, fecal material, and semen. This mass also has several forms of virus, bacteria, and parasites, many of which have been found only within SCP-835. The bacterium 835-I5 forms the major concern for containment, due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. This, coupled with the extremely hard “shell” of SCP-835, form a major obstacle to neutralization. Any force capable of “cracking open” SCP-835 would also cause the “slurry” inside to spread, and cause additional infection from 835-I5. \\n Addendum 835-01: First Draft of After Action Report by Mobile Task Force Zeta-Niner: Circumstances of Retrieval \\n On ██-██-████ at ████:██:██ hours, Mobile Task Force Zeta-Niner (Mole Rats) conducted an investigation of SCP-835. At this time, SCP-835 had a mass of only four tons, and only one large polyp at the north end of the structure (designated Polyp Alpha), Polyp Bravo not yet being in existence. \\n As per standard procedure, four team members were chosen for the initial investigation. Standard isolation suits (underwater variant) were worn by all four team members: Lieutenant C█████████ took point as team leader, while Sergeants L██████ and M█████ served as support. Corporal H████, a rookie team member, accompanied the team as an observer. A standard Underwater Remote Vehicle, or URV, was used for initial investigation. \\n SCP-835 did not, at first, act in a hostile manner towards the team, allowing team members to approach and make contact without incident. URV-01 was sent to investigate the exterior of the object while team members C, L, and M proceeded towards what they believed to be the entrance of the site. Corporal H was ordered to remain outside and to monitor URV-1 in order to ensure that the device\\'s tether did not become tangled on the exterior protrusions. \\n The first sign of trouble occurred when Corporal H, while attempting to clear a jam in URV-1\\'s sampling claw, reported in with the words, \"Oh god, help me, help me.\" He then reported that \"some horrible tentacle thing\" had wrapped around his arm and was dragging him in towards a \"fucking mouth,\" and vocalized several distress calls… Jesus Christ. I can\\'t do this. Fucking… goddamn it, he was just a kid! It was his first fucking mission, I should have kept my eye on him! \\n Christ… all right, here goes, guess I\\'ll just let Sarge edit this for me. Again. \\n So the thing grabbed the kid. It had me fooled to rights. The entrance wasn\\'t an entrance, it was just… some cave. The real entrance was the big polyp thing on the north end. It grabbed the kid and started dragging him towards the mouth. Topside started to drag him up, but all they got was a snapped cable. And the kid? He got pulled inside and eaten. \\n [DATA EXPUNGED] I got the carabiner on, we\\'re hooked together, and topside starts winching us up… and we\\'re not getting anywhere. I\\'m grabbing on, I\\'m telling him I\\'m not gonna let go, and then the winch starts to seize up, and I feel this jerk on the tether and it goes slack, and then we\\'re both sliding into that damn thing. \\n It was like… Jesus, I need another drink… fuck. It was like… the only way I can think of it was like you know that thing that doctors do when they stick a tube up someone\\'s ass and look at the inside of their intestines? I saw that on TV once, it was like that, except I was going down the throat of some horrible underwater hell-monster, not up some poor bastard\\'s rear. There were these… muscular contractions, I guess, and they were slowly sliding us down the length of the tube. If we weren\\'t wearing the hard suits, we\\'d have been crushed, but as it was, we were held so tight we could barely move, even with power-assist. I managed to get my head up enough to see the kid\\'s face. His faceplate was covered in vomit, poor bastard had puked in his suit. I started yelling for him, trying to get him to say something. He managed to tell me he was all right. He was sobbing like a baby. \\n I started doing some calculations. Based on my dead reckoning tracker and initial sonar scans, we were moving about a meter every minute. That meant seventy two hours until we came out the other side, assuming we did. We had the air, our rebreathers could keep going for days. What we didn\\'t have was the power to keep the suits warm for that long. If the heat went out, hypothermia would kill us… I dunno, look it up, in any case we\\'d be dead. We needed to conserve power. \\n I told the kid to turn off his helmet lights, lock his joints, and turn down his heater to minimal. He started crying. He didn\\'t wanna do it. I didn\\'t blame him, but I told him we had no choice. We finally agreed to shut down everything but our internal helmet lights, at least. It seemed to calm him down, and honestly, that extra 0.1 percent power wouldn\\'t make a difference. \\n I think that was the worst part. We spent at least a day like that, locked in our suits. Couldn\\'t move our arms and legs. No sound but the thing\\'s gurgling and your own breathing and the sound of your rebreather. The puke on the kid\\'s faceplate started to dry up and flake off about an hour or so in so I could see his face. He looked tired and scared. \\n I think… check the logs, Sarge, I think it was about thirteen hours in when the kid started talking again. Kid started babbling. [DATA EXPUNGED]. Anyway, after that, he calmed down a lot. I told him to take a nap. He slept a bit, thank god. \\n About twenty four hours in, we reached… I guess they\\'re calling it the stomach now. First warning sign was a gurgling kind of noise, louder, with a crunching noise over it. I told the kid to bring his suit up to full power and get ready. A little while after, we fell out into this big chamber… big as in, big enough for the two of us to fit in it comfortably, which was huge compared to the tight squeeze of the tube. Kid\\'s suit started hissing and the outer shell started to turn all pitted and stuff, and I noticed my gloves were starting to degrade too, so I yelled at him to move, and we started heading towards this… sphincter, I guess. I remember… god, why can I remember this, the insides of the stomach were lined with [DATA EXPUNGED]. \\n I almost lost it there, [DATA EXPUNGED] I\\'d stayed, my suit would have melted and I\\'d be dead, but the kid grabbed me and shoved me headfirst through the sphincter and we fell into… the other place. \\n It was even worse than the stomach. [DATA EXPUNGED], this place was… well, you know what it was full of. I\\'m not squeamish, Bill, you can\\'t be if you\\'re a Mole Rat, but this place squicked me out so bad I almost passed out. The kid helped me back up to my feet, though, told me we were almost out. \"Come on, Lieutenant, we\\'re almost out of here, let\\'s go,\" he said. We moved over to the other sphincter, but the thing was… well, it was puckered up tighter than my Drill Sergeant\\'s asshole back in basic. So no way we were getting out of there. \\n We decided to wait for a bit until the thing shot its load, so to speak: ██ ██ ████ ████ ███ ███, ██ █████ ████ ██ ████ ██ ███ ██████████, █████? Anyway, that\\'s when things started to go bad. [DATA EXPUNGED] I managed to wrestle the thing ████ ███ ████ ████ ███ ███ through the sphincter into the stomach. Its tentacles writhed at me as it started to melt. [DATA EXPUNGED] \\n Then 835 blew its load and I flew out its ass into the ocean. \\n You know the rest of the story, Bill. [DATA EXPUNGED] So yeah, fill out the rest of the reports and the logs for me, will ya? Oh, and be sure to edit it so the motherfuckers in command don\\'t yell at me for being unprofessional in my AARs again. I\\'m gonna finish off my drink and take a couple Valium and go to bed.

Following the events of incident 1004-Dale, Researchers are no longer allowed to view the output of SCP-1004, even when filtered or via secondary source. Only D-class are allowed to view the output of SCP-1004. Use of SCP-1133-7 and SCP-894 instances by researchers and control subjects has been approved where deemed appropriate in preventing undesired spread of SCP-1004\\'s effects. \\n The Foundation has set out to prevent anyone from receiving copies of SCP-1004 by a planned and ordered process of unrequested electronic mailings, many of which include computer viruses, malware or electronic worms. A program has also been designed and disseminated to all electronic mail providers to help prevent SCP-1004 from spreading. \\n Description: SCP-1004 is a computer program, found on either a CD (SCP-1004-2) or a 3.5\" diskette (SCP-1004-1), either of which will be hand labeled with the words \\'Factory Porn.\\' Contained on these disks is a single executable file, labeled \\'Thefactory.exe\\', a 1-kilobyte program. The program runs perfectly on all platforms. Running the program results in a window opening on the computer, within which \\'The Factory\\' logo is displayed. The logo fades to black, and is replaced by the words \\'What would you like to see?\\' At this point, the user may input any selection of words, from the ambiguous to the precise. Once a request has been input, the program will pull up several dozen images of pornographic content, each of which leads to a full video on the subject. Many of these videos appear to have never been made in real life. \\n Watching videos on SCP-1004 has a cumulative effect. The more pornography a user views, the more disturbing their sexual desires become, and the harder sexual gratification becomes. After approximately 100 straight hours of viewing pornography on SCP-1004, even the most \\'normal\\' of viewers will display an interest in scatology play, the torture and murder of living beings, bestiality, pedophilia, and combinations of the previous. The deadening of reactivity to sexual gratification will encourage them to either seek out such things with other people, or to mutilate themselves and their genitalia. \\n It should be noted that SCP-1004 displays no compulsive properties. Users are free at any time to stop using the program. The majority of users continue to use SCP-1004 because it is the easiest way to find the desired pornography. \\n As stated above, any word, or combination of words may be entered. This has been used by many victims to view popular members of high social standing in the bedroom, giving rise to many rumors of \\'celebrity sex tapes.\\' The thought has been posited that such videos could be used for the blackmailing of politicians who are antithetical to the Foundation cause. Unfortunately, at this time, all attempts to make recordings of SCP-1004 have resulted in only taped static. Several researchers have claimed to be able to see humanoid shapes moving in the static, but this effect has not been seen on subsequent playthroughs. \\n SCP-1004 appears to spread through the use of electronic messages, sent seemingly at random. Messages generally claim to have certain celebrities performing sexual acts, or to have certain depraved acts on tape that are illegal in many jurisdictions. A link included in the message requests users to enter their home address. The resulting copy of SCP-1004 show up in a plain brown wrapper within three days, through bulk mail, with no return address. \\n The Foundation currently contains 37 copies of SCP-1004-1, and 23 copies of SCP-1004-2. \\n Incident 1004-Dale: Researcher Adam Dale was found to be encouraging D-class subjects to watch SCP-1004, and copulate with each other for his pleasure. It was determined Researcher Dale had been affected by SCP-1004 despite never having watched it directly, only monitoring the tests through a video feed. Any and all indirect viewing of SCP-1004 has been canceled. \\n Older edition of SCP-1004 \\n « SCP-1003 | SCP-1004 | SCP-1005 »\"', 'SCP-2182': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-2182 \\n Item #: SCP-2182 \\n Object Class: Euclid \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2182 is to be held within a containment room in Unit 9 at Site-18. Experimentation on SCP-2182 is currently barred. A mobile perimeter is to be established around instances of SCP-2182 for the purposes of monitoring during testing. \\n Description: SCP-2182 is a bronze, winged rod similar in appearance to a traditional Greek caduceus. The rod is 35\\xa0cm long and entwined with ivory. Folded ivory wings similar to that of a bird form the base of the handle. The bronze and ivory are somehow capable of bending slightly while maintaining composition. \\n SCP-2182 affects inanimate objects and materials, solid, liquid, and gas. Biological subjects are unaffected by SCP-2182. SCP-2182\\'s effect differs depending on the object affected and the individual wielding SCP-2182. \\n In general, SCP-2182 will cause objects to become animate in an anthropomorphic and sexually suggestive manner. Objects will often change shape and can continue action for up to three hours (as of the longest recording). The automatons are typically benign, non-sapient, and cease effect permanently. Certain inanimate objects are unaffected. Reasons for this are unknown. \\n Effects differ with persons utilizing SCP-2182. SCP-2182 can typically be activated by grasping the handle and performing a thrusting motion at the intended object. The user must also be visualizing the object. \\n Further details on SCP-2182 effects can be found in the accompanying testing logs. \\n Addendum: Testing Logs. Researchers are to remain anonymous under Level Two clearance. \\n RE: Mirror Test 04/03/87 \\n Frank, the subject didn\\'t report being affected by the events with the mirror. But something interesting happened in that a small stream of light was visible reflecting off of the mirror. Went straight up into the sky. Subject noticed this too. Looks like whatever\\'s causing this reflects and is visible when it bounces. Might want to look into that. \\n RE: RE: Mirror Test 04/03/87 \\n We\\'ve relayed the coordinates.

While SCP-2254\\'s incorporeal nature has made it difficult to house in any long-term containment vessel, SCP-2254\\'s isolation within Fallon has been deemed an acceptable amount of exposure in exchange for sustained containment of the entity. \\n Foundation agents embedded within local law enforcement are to identify anomalous pregnancies that result from involvement by SCP-22541, and introduce an acceptable level of both mifepristone and prostaglandin into the affected subject\\'s drinking water in order to induce miscarriage. Due to this protocol, the rate of SCP-2254-1 manifestation has significantly decreased since SCP-2254\\'s discovery. \\n The continued implementation of the Black Tuesday Protocol is imperative to the ongoing containment of SCP-2254. \\n Updated Containment Memorandum: Per Foundation Protocol 2513.99, the ongoing containment of SCP-2254 has been transferred to the jurisdiction of Project PARAGON. All other extant containment procedures remain in place. \\n Description: SCP-2254 is a hostile, massive, incorporeal entity contained within the town of Fallon, Alabama. SCP-2254 is invisible to the naked eye, and can only be viewed using infrared cameras. SCP-2254\\'s form is that of a wildly distorted humanoid, roughly 12.8m in height, with extremely distended arms and six legs2, a misshapen neck and face, thick shoulder length hair and severely disfigured genitals3. SCP-2254\\'s skin is dark and mottled, and aside from six eyes arranged in two vertical columns of three per side SCP-2254\\'s face is otherwise featureless, lacking a nose or mouth. SCP-2254\\'s single other defining characteristic is the pictogram of the letter \"J\" above a heart that seems to have been branded into its forehead. \\n Processed image of SCP-2254 taken from an infrared camera. \\n SCP-2254 is seemingly capable of influencing human decision-making by altering cognition and manipulating young humans (typically under the age of 20) into copulation who would not otherwise be driven to do so. This manifests as a reported \"dream state\" wherein affected individuals are brought together semi-unconsciously to perform sexual intercourse while in a state of elevated suggestiveness and arousal4. These unions will generally always end in insemination, though SCP-2254\\'s influence can be disturbed by the application of lachrymator agents (such as tear gas) or ammonia inhalants. Subjects brought out of SCP-2254\\'s influence during the act of copulation usually express some confusion and hostility towards the source of the disturbance which abates over time. Afflicted subjects will also not express any kind of regret about the sexual union in question, though whether this is also the nature of SCP-2254\\'s influence is currently unknown. \\n SCP-2254 generally manifests at the Little Rock Canyon falls near Fallon, though not in any regular pattern. It is believed that SCP-2254 is more likely to manifest on nights where there are more age-appropriate targets freely available to interact with each other sexually, though this has not been confirmed. After manifestation, SCP-2254 will stalk towards any gathering of targets, potentially persuading targets in its path to move towards other targets in an attempt to influence more subjects into engaging in sexual intercourse. \\n Once at least one pairing of targets has come together in one place and begun interacting sexually, SCP-2254 will lower its face to be level with the pair (or group) and will stare, unblinking, until the act is finished. On the rare occasion the insemination does not occur, SCP-2254 will linger above the pairing for a period of time, during which the couple will interact very little. After a certain amount of time, SCP-2254 will lower its face again and the sexual act will begin again. There have been no instances of insemination not occurring during the second instance. While the odds of conception through this manner are no different than usual, there is a significant chance (>68%) that the mother will become pregnant with an anomalous fetus classified as an SCP-2254-1 instance. \\n Subjects who become anomalously pregnant as a result of SCP-2254\\'s influence will experience the rapid growth of the SCP-2254-1 fetal structure, which will quickly take on non-human characteristics. These fetuses do not fully match either parent in genetic makeup and instead more closely resemble a hypothetical proto-human or early human ancestor, with many of the same deformed characteristics of SCP-2254. As they develop, SCP-2254-1 instances will take increasingly more resources away from their mothers, starving them to encourage their own expedited growth. Despite this, SCP-2254-1 instances negatively affect the cognition of their birth mother, who will become passionately defensive of the SCP-2254-1 instance even as it devours her from the inside out. \\n SCP-2254-1 instance during dissection. Approximate age is eight days post conception. \\n SCP-2254-1 instances generally do not kill their host mother before birthing themselves, though they do cause a significant amount of damage during their birthing that can lead to the mother\\'s death by exsanguination from the vaginal canal. Despite a gestation and birthing process that leaves the mother exhausted and extremely malnourished, affected mothers are generally unable to recognize the anomalous nature of SCP-2254-1 instances and will care for them as if they were normal human newborns, including breastfeeding them. SCP-2254-1 instances are extremely sexually violent, and will attempt to rape, maim, and consume any living creature that disturbs them when they are with their mother. \\n Mothers will generally continue to breastfeed the SCP-2254-1 instances (usually two or three are born at a time) until they either expire, typically from severe malnutrition or cardiac arrest, or reach maturity. In the event of their mothers\\' death, SCP-2254-1 instances will consume the corpse and then disappear into any available nearby sheltered area, including abandoned buildings, forests, scrapyards, etc. Uncontained SCP-2254-1 instances are believed to be the cause of no fewer than thirty reported sexually explicit deaths over the last fifteen years. \\n Addendum 2254.1: Discovery \\n SCP-2254 was discovered after an amateur photographer from Fort Payne, Alabama, accidentally captured footage of SCP-2254 through an infrared camera lens. Foundation assets quickly secured a perimeter around the town, after which a four month period of research and investigation began. It was determined that SCP-2254 was not containable by typical methods, and after SCP-2254 was followed to Birmingham, Alabama to follow a local of the town who had recently moved to the city, programs were implemented to discourage movement of affected persons out of Fallon. More information about this can be found in Addendum 2254.2. \\n Addendum 2254.2: Black Tuesday Protocol \\n The Black Tuesday Protocol was established to purposefully and effectively depress the local economy of Fallon, Alabama, in order to retain the local population and control exposure to SCP-2254. The Black Tuesday Protocol is built on five core tenets: \\n The Black Tuesday Protocol also dictates the ongoing treatment of five women from Fallon who no longer live within the town and who are visited occasionally by SCP-2254. All of these women, ages 16-29, are being dosed through their water supply with the aforementioned mix of mifepristone and prostaglandin to inhibit pregnancy. They are unconscious of this treatment, and while their inability to conceive children has taken a marked toll on their mental health the protocol has significantly diminished their odds to conceive an SCP-2254-1 instance, and has reduced the number of birthed instances outside of Fallon to zero. \\n Addendum 2254.3: Interview \\n The following is an interview by Agent Lamiere, posing as an investigative journalist, and a local woman named Kate Barnett. Mrs. Barnett was, notably, twice the subject of anomalous conception due to SCP-2254\\'s influence, the first of which resulted in the birth of two SCP-2254-1 instances and the second of which was caught and terminated as a result of current containment measures. \\n [BEGIN LOG] \\n Agent Lamiere: (Pauses) …alright, we\\'re recording. Thanks for taking the time to sit with me, Ms…? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Oh, that\\'s Kate. Kate Barnett. But my maiden name is Kate Forrest. \\n Agent Lamiere: Perfect, perfect. So when I called you on the phone, I had asked about some things that had come up in your medical history. \\n Mrs. Barnett: You talking about my babies. \\n Agent Lamiere: Yes. How many kids did you say you had? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Well, there\\'s Daniel5, and Bub6, and the twins7, then baby June who passed8. I was pregnant with another but it didn\\'t make it neither9. \\n Agent Lamiere: Yeah, that\\'s perfect. Can you tell me about anything unusual you may have noticed with the twins? Something strange about how they were conceived, I mean. \\n Mrs. Barnett: You mean \\'bout their daddy? He\\'s a good-for-nothing. We had one stupid drunk night then I got knocked up and he ran off10. Didn\\'t want nothing to do with them. Would\\'ve been lost if it weren\\'t for Jack. \\n Agent Lamiere: Jack? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Yeah. Jack\\'s bout as much daddy as they\\'ve had. It\\'s good, too, since he\\'s a damn sight better father than Mason ever would\\'ve been. \\n Agent Lamiere: Who\\'s Jack? \\n Mrs. Barnett: He\\'s- (hesitates) you ever seen something in a dream, and then later you seen it in real life and you just know it\\'s the same? That\\'s Jack. He come to me the night Mason got me knocked up, and he\\'s so pretty with that blond hair and his eyes. He knows how to treat a woman right. I told him that Mason had left and that I think he had got me pregnant, and Jack said not to worry about it. That he\\'d be there to take care of things. \\n Agent Lamiere: How did you know you were pregnant? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Oh, that\\'s just mother\\'s intuition. Sometimes you just know. And I knew, and Jack knew too. But he told me everything was going to be alright, and that he\\'d take care of my babies. \\n Agent Lamiere: I see. How long have you known Jack? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Well… ever since I was little, I guess. Maybe since when I was in the 9th grade, when Daniel was born. Jack was there then. He didn\\'t say much then, just that I was his special girl and that he was gonna be around for a while. He wasn\\'t around much when Dan was growing up, but he was when the twins were born and then again when I had the miscarriage. God- (sniffles) he was so sad about that. I cried and cried and he just held my hand and said \"There there, that\\'s alright. You\\'re still my special girl\". \\n Agent Lamiere: Are you the only person who knows Jack? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Mmmmmm… I don\\'t think so. I think just about all girls around here know Jack. He\\'s just so supportive, you know? Like, it\\'s like he knows what it\\'s like to want to be a mother, and he\\'s just there to make it alright. To some of them, though, you know, he\\'s just Jack, but… (laughs) between you and me, he\\'s my Jack. \\n Agent Lamiere: I see. Anything else you have to add? \\n Mrs. Barnett: I don\\'t think so. (Pauses) Hey, you seem to know all about this. You ever seen Jack\\'s brothers? \\n Agent Lamiere: Brothers? \\n Mrs. Barnett: Yeah. I think they\\'re all named Jack, they\\'re just each sort of different. Jack is scared of them. I am too, but I ain\\'t never seen em. Just the way he talks about them, you know they\\'re bad. \\n Agent Lamiere: Bad? Bad how? \\n Mrs. Barnett: I don\\'t know. I just know that Jack is always smilin\\', except when he talks about his brothers. Then he\\'s not smilin\\' much at all. \\n [END LOG] \\n « SCP-2253 | SCP-2254 | SCP-2255 » \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"SCP-2254\" by djkaktus, from the SCP Wiki.

Efforts have been made in several countries to ban or regulate the practice of \"phone sex\", especially in a high-volume commercialized form; these efforts have largely been unsuccessful, and in some cases merely caused these \"phone sex\" telephone lines to move their operations to jurisdictions which are more difficult for the Foundation to monitor. \\n Individuals identified as carriers of any strain of SCP-2607 are to be detained and questioned about their sexual history to identify other possible carriers, then treated with a targeted antiviral drug developed as part of the SCP-2607 containment initiative. Medical records of herpes simplex cases are to be regularly cross-referenced with employees and habitual users of \"phone sex\" telephone lines, and with users of sexual role-playing websites; any pattern indicative of a possible SCP-2607 outbreak is to be investigated as soon as possible. \\n Samples of SCP-2607-1 and -2 are stored in Bio Site-66\\'s cryogenic storage facility; research proposals involving exposure of D-Class personnel to SCP-2607 must be approved by Site-66\\'s Ethics Committee liaison, and all experimental subjects must be treated with the targeted SCP-2607 antiviral at the conclusion of the experiment. \\n Description: SCP-2607 is the collective designation for two strains of the herpes simplex virus with similar anomalous means of transmission, designated SCP-2607-1 and -2. Both strains of SCP-2607 cause similar symptoms to HSV-2, the herpes simplex strain which causes most cases of genital herpes; blisters appear on the genitalia within approximately 7 days of initial exposure, and heal over the next several weeks. SCP-2607 strains can be transmitted via sexual contact, as with non-anomalous varieties of herpes simplex, but each can also be transmitted by certain non-physical sexual activities. \\n SCP-2607-1\\'s primary anomalous mode of transmission is through \"phone sex\"—sexual role-playing or descriptions of hypothetical sexual activity transmitted via telephone. For SCP-2607-1 to be transmitted, the infected and uninfected participants must describe a scenario in which, were the sexual activity occurring physically, it would be possible to transmit herpes simplex; descriptions of proper condom use reduce transmission rate by approximately 30%. Research has shown that SCP-2607-1 can also be transmitted via in-person sexual role-playing (i.e. \"phone sex\" without the telephone); in-person sexual role-playing reduces the transmission rate by approximately 50%. SCP-2607-1 cannot be transmitted through recorded speech or through text-based erotic role-playing; the infected and uninfected participants must share a direct audio connection. \\n SCP-2607-2\\'s primary anomalous mode of transmission is through online erotic role-playing. Similarly to SCP-2607-1, both the infected and uninfected participants must describe a scenario which could lead to transmission of non-anomalous herpes simplex. Unlike SCP-2607-1, the responses need not be immediate; successful transmission has been observed with a lag between successive messages of as long as three weeks. SCP-2607-2 can also be transmitted via SMS-based erotic role-playing (\"sexting\") and via telephone, although the rate of transmission is reduced by approximately 75%. Erotic role-playing not mediated by some electronic medium (in-person, or via written or printed descriptions) cannot transmit SCP-2607-2. \\n SCP-2607-1 was first identified by the Foundation in 1983, when a number of individuals reporting herpes simplex infections without prior sexual activity were found to have called the same \"phone sex\" line; records from the \"phone sex\" line indicated that each of these individuals had engaged in sexual role-playing with the same operator, Ms. Ella Pickering, then a student at the University of Central Lancashire. Ms. Pickering was detained and interviewed; she claims to have only had a single sexual partner, a fellow student named \"Simeon Plesko\" whom she met at a party. Ms. Pickering only engaged in sexual intercourse with this individual once, and said that he \"left [her] flat before [she] woke up and never called [her] back.\" University of Central Lancashire records contain no mention of a student by this name; Simeon Plesko has been classified as Person of Interest 2607-Α. \\n SCP-2607-2 was identified in 2005, when almost every active member of \"Islands of Desire,\" a server of the MMORPG1 Neverwinter Nights devoted to erotic role-playing, sought treatment for herpes simplex. Approximately one week before the first users reported herpes simplex infections, the server had hosted a nautical group sex-themed event called \"Orgies of the Sword Coast,\" coinciding with the release of the Neverwinter Nights expansion pack \"Pirates of the Sword Coast;\" an individual with the username \"Sim_Plex\" had been very active during this event. Attempts to trace this user via IP or payment information proved fruitless; investigation is still ongoing. \\n « SCP-2606 | SCP-2607 | SCP-2608 »\"', 'SCP-2610': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-2610 \\n SCP-2610 - Procreation \\n ▸ More by this Author ◂ \\n  \\n   \\n F.A.Q. \\n Due to the graphic details described below, information pertaining to SCP-2610 is on a need-to-know basis, and is currently restricted to Level 3/2610 personnel only. \\n SCP-2610-A. \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2610-A, -B, -C, -D, and all instances of SCP-2610-E are currently presumed neutralized due to the unlikeliness of survival after the events of \"Incident 2610 UIU Tango-Tango\" as described in Addendum 2610.8: Incident UIU Tango-Tango. \\n Despite this, Foundation personnel are to monitor for any additional sightings of any instance of SCP-2610. \\n Description: SCP-2610-A, -B, -C, and -D were the siblings Simeon, Armond, Yvette, and Jorge Avakian (the latter two of whom were fraternal twins), born 1922, 1929, and possibly 19431, respectively. All four siblings were born to Droman Avakian and Anita Martel of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Prior to Incident 2610 UIU Tango-Tango, SCP-2610-A was a well known medical doctor and self-proclaimed \"telepath\", SCP-2610-B was a deckhand employed at the Boston Harbor, and SCP-2610-C and -D were unemployed. \\n Through the use of currently poorly understood medical techniques developed by SCP-2610-A, the siblings conspired and succeeded in altering their genetic makeup in a way that anomalously affected their incestuously conceived offspring. These offspring (and the offspring of those offspring) were classified as SCP-2610-E collectively, and together with their parents (self-described as \"The Firstborn\") were classified as \"The Colony\" by the initial United States Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU) investigators who discovered and led to the neutralization of SCP-2610. \\n SCP-2610-E instances were anomalously bred to have a significantly shorter than natural gestation period, and a rapid rate of growth. As a result of these changes, and the limited diversity of genetic material between SCP-2610-E instances due to severe inbreeding, SCP-2610-E instances were genetically human but carried a high number of physical malformations and abnormalities, along with sharply stunted mental faculties. \\n Droman Avakian, Anita Martel, and SCP-2610-A, -C, and -D. The other woman is unidentified. On the back of the image was written \"Whore of His Deliverance\" in black ink. \\n The entirety of SCP-2610 is believed to have been neutralized by United States Navy fighters at the order of the UIU on November 16th, 1971. More information regarding this incident can be found in Addendum 2610.8: Incident UIU Tango-Tango. \\n Due to lack of direct involvement in the case of SCP-2610, all information regarding SCP-2610 has been collected through cooperation between Foundation personnel and UIU agents. Please see the addenda below for official UIU reports pertaining to SCP-2610. \\n Addendum 2610-1: Background and Discovery \\n SCP-2610-A, -B, -C, and -D were all born near Boston, Massachusetts. Their father, Droman Avakian, was a laborer in the area. Much of their extended family lived either in Iran (paternal) or France (maternal). Little information about the family is available prior to the birth of SCP-2610-A, though immigration forms do confirm that a \"D. Avakian\" traveled to New York from Morocco in 1911. \\n SCP-2610-A was born on January 16th, 1922 at the West Boston Military Medical Center (now defunct). From a young age, SCP-2610-A expressed a variety of anomalous traits, specifically a self-described \"telepathy\". SCP-2610-A wrote extensively about this in several journals recovered after Incident UIU Tango Tango. Below is an excerpt from one of those journals: \\n \"…it is not so much that I feel the feelings of those around me, like the common empath, but more that I can see the images and hear the impulses of every person, man and wo-man, who I can reach out to with my mind. The cacophony that was once the nightmare of my youth has, in experience, turned into a most curious and invaluable tool…\" \\n Years later, SCP-2610-A described an event that is referenced several times elsewhere in the text, and was seen as being of great importance to the subject: \\n …and it was then that I reached out with my own mind to the person on the table and, sensing the emptiness in theirs, put myself within it. Like a shade had been pulled from over my face, suddenly I could see with other eyes, hear with other ears, indeed, I saw and heard myself staring down at myself, mouth agape with wonder. \\n But the lobotomy is not so simple or without risk that it could be administered to the number that my thoughts imagine without notice. As to what would happen were I to find myself together with another conscious, should the patient recover, I cannot say. Better it would be, I think, should the subject be birthed with no consciousness at all; a completely virgin mind… \\n SCP-2610-B on left. Image date unknown. \\n Of SCP-2610-B, little is noted in any records aside from a birth record (also from the West Boston Military Medical Center) and an employment file with the Kervier Shipping Company in 1945 (which included a fingerprint and vehicle registration). Of note, SCP-2610-B is mentioned only once in SCP-2610-A\\'s journals, where it is referenced that SCP-2610-B sexually assaulted an unnamed immigrant woman near the shipyards, which necessitated the lobotomy performed by SCP-2610-A in the previous passage as a cover. \\n SCP-2610-C and -D are not mentioned in any birth records or citizenship records. Aside from references in SCP-2610-A\\'s journals (including a handful of photographs) and UIU records indicating their involvement, there is no outside evidence of their existence whatsoever. \\n In March of 1959, SCP-2610-A was arrested on charges of illegal medical practices on minors. Though SCP-2610-A was able to settle with the victims for an undisclosed amount, SCP-2610-A withdrew from the medical field. No further mention of SCP-2610-A or its siblings is noted until Incident UIU Tango-15. \\n Addendum 2610.2: Incident UIU Tango-11 \\n The following information was gathered from UIU incident logs. \\n UIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-1-1\\nAgent Designation: Cyprus\\nDate: ██/██/████ \\n Police report filed November 12th, 1965: \\n BREAK-IN AT ████ W 15th ST. ██████, ██ \\n FOUR INDIVIDUALS AT LARGE\\nINDETERMINATE SEX\\nTHREE PERSONS KILLED\\nHEAVILY RESISTANT TO WEAPON FIRE\\nCAPABLE OF MOVING AT HIGH SPEED\\nINHUMANLY STRONG\\nESCAPED WITH FOUR LARGE TRUCKS OF CATTLE FEED\\nDESCRIBED AS \"GROTESQUE\"\\nBE ADVISED HIGHLY DANGEROUS \\n Unit investigators became involved after Bureau was contacted. Subjects were described as \"roughly six-feet tall\" and \"vaguely human\", with a number of obvious and grotesque physical malformations, such as missing or additional limbs, eyes, ears, etc., collapsed ribcages or extruded stomachs, large growths across the body. Did not succumb to weapon fire and moved quickly but jarringly on stilted or broken limbs. Did not attempt to communicate. Three people within the storehouse, identified as ██████ ███████, ████ ███████, and █████ █████████, were found dead at the scene. All individuals showed signs of violent ██████ ███████, including ███████████ ██ ███ ████ █████ ████████████, ███████████ ██ █████ █████████, and other severe trauma. Fingerprints gathered from the scene, but did not match any known suspects. \\n Investigation is ongoing. \\n Addendum 2610.3: Excerpt from Recovered Journal \\n The following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU. \\n Last night I was visited by an Angel. \\n As she slipped into my room I felt the warmth of her around me, and opened my eyes to take in her beauty. Her flesh rippled and tore, and light shined through the cracks like the sun. She reached out to me, held me in her many arms and slid herself inside of me. As she entered my body, I heard her whisper to me words sent from the LORD. My pen does not do justice to her voice, but I wrote it nonetheless; \\n \"Soft and silent, Child of God,\\nfor you have been chosen to lead His people\\nand create for Him and New Eden.\\nThrough your seed will his nation be built,\\nand the seed of your brothers will fertilize its fields.\\nHe has provided for you the Whore of His Deliverance,\\nin your own blood she is born.\\nHer womb will open for your seed and the seed of your offspring,\\nand their seed upon their seed,\\nuntil the Earth is made anew in His Image.\" \\n Then she produced from within me a vial of liquid, both glorious and putrid, and told me how to use it to create the Seed of His New Eden. As she removed herself from within me I climaxed, and she said to me \"Truly this is the last of your seed that shall be spilled without purpose, for now it is given new purpose.\" Then she was gone, and I was filled with His voice. The voice that will guide my hand on this page and write the New Testament of Creation. \\n Even now, I can feel his words inside me, washing away the sin that once cluttered my mind. \\n My whole life\\'s work has been for this, it must be. The LORD gave me this sight so that I might lead His people to His New Eden. All of the struggle will finally be worth the suffering.\" \\n Addendum 2610.4: Incident UIU Tango-15 \\n UIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-1-5\\nAgent Designation: Ulysses\\nDate: ██/██/████ \\n Another theft of a large quantity of livestock feed. A shipment of cattle feed bound for S. Carolina was ransacked last night. Five dockhands are dead, same type of wounds as the ones at the storehouse. Officers responding to the scene did manage to disable one of the fleeing vehicles. The subjects within fled the scene, but the vehicle was recovered and identified as belonging to A. Avakian, a dockhand from Boston whose fingerprints were recognized as also being from the previous scene. Records on file show he has not been employed with the Kervier group for several months. \\n During a chase with one of the vehicles, one of the human-like creatures described in the previous incident report leaped from within the trailer onto a pursuing squad car and assaulted the officers within. One officer was killed, the other (the driver) managed to crash the vehicle into a nearby embankment, totaling it. The officer managed to escape, while the creature (which was pinned below the vehicle) perished. \\n Addendum 2610.5: Excerpt from Recovered Journal \\n The following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU. \\n The seeding has begun in earnest. Our sister was hesitant, but she too was visited by the Angel of the LORD but a week past, and her eyes were opened and her womb was made ready for the Colony of New Eden. She now awaits us every night, prepared to receive the Seed. \\n The tears of my sin that the Angel drew from within me are miraculous. When served with holy wine to a male host, the seed of that host plants itself within the womb with such tenacity. Then, the offspring grows within the host with a great speed, while the mother is nourished only by the power of God and his agents here on Earth. And what virile children are born from this union! Ready themselves to give and receive the Seed, in their own station. The tears follow through the generations, and each gestation is as swift and fruitious as the last. \\n My sister, the Whore of His Deliverance, has already produced for me a son. I have named him Ezekial, and he will be the champion of our New World. \\n Even now, I can hear my Brother delivering upon her as well. The Colony grows stronger every day. Soon the Daughters will be strong enough to take Seed of their own, and produce more Children. \\n The LORD has spoken to me, and has said \"be fruitful and multiply, for the Earth is mine through you.\" The LORD has prepared my sight to lead our Children, and I will prepare my mind for HIM when he arrives. \\n Addendum 2610.6: Incident UIU Tango-18 \\n UIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-1-8\\nAgent Designation: Grenada\\nDate: ██/██/1970 \\n N/A \\n On ██/██/1970, after a tip from agents embedded within local utilities companies, Unit Agents moved on the abandoned █████████ Packaging Corp. warehouse. Despite the structure being empty for more than thirty years, it had recently began to draw power from nearby lines. Additionally, an automobile registered to one H. Rutherford, which was confirmed as being sold to one Simeon Avakian five years prior, was seen at the site. \\n Agents initially found the warehouse empty, but sounds from below led the group to an operational lift located in the northwest corner of the main level. The agents descended to a third basement level via the lift, and then to another basement level by stairs, before encountering [GRAPHIC DETAILS EXPUNGED]. \\n Of the thirteen agents who entered the warehouse, only four escaped to a local FBI stronghouse. The details of the incident are described below. \\n Agent Rico: Alright, we\\'re recording now. Try it again, speak here— \\n Agent Carter: Fuck the fucking recorder, Marc. Are you calling Central? \\n Agent Rico: They\\'re getting them on the line right now, Cooper. We\\'ve gotta record this though, so help me here. \\n Agent Carter: I already told you, I— (aside) are they on the fucking phone? \\n Agent Rico: Cooper! \\n Agent Carter: Fine. We got down to the second, third? -whatever, one of the basements at the █████████ place. You could smell it before you heard it, and hear it from a floor or two up. We come around the corner and there are… I don\\'t know, Marc, two hundred? Four? More than I could count quickly. \\n Agent Rico: What were they? \\n Agent Carter: They weren\\'t fucking people. They— I don\\'t know, they looked like people, but… more like just flesh. Everywhere, just flesh. It was some kind of orgy, they were all fucking each other, and there were eyes and arms and hair and teeth everywhere, places where it shouldn\\'t fucking be, and— \\n Agent Rico: Calm down, Cooper, ca— \\n Agent Carter: Calm down? They fucking █████ Riley and pulled Yates into a dozen pieces, his arms and… fuck, man. I don\\'t know how I got out of there. Oh god, Nate was screaming the whole time, and they just tore into him and— \\n Agent Rico: Did you see any humans in there? \\n Agent Carter: Just one guy, but he was doing the same fucking thing. \\n Agent Rico: Could you identify this man? (Produces image of SCP-2610-B) \\n Agent Carter: That\\'s the— Christ, Rico, that\\'s the fuckin\\' guy. \\n Agent Baxter: Alright, we just got word from Central. We\\'re torching the place. \\n At the conclusion of this interview, UIU forces proceeded to launch an attack on the █████████ warehouse. While the structure was completely demolished, no remains were recovered from the debris. Signs of habitation2 confirmed the presence of some kind of activity, but no additional information was recovered from the site. \\n Addendum 2610.7: Excerpt from Recovered Journal \\n The following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU. \\n The Colony grows. \\n My sister, the Whore, has given birth to so many of our holy children. Even now, she lays in ecstasy at the thought of serving the LORD. Her daughters have become the vessels for the Seed of her sons, and their daughters and their sons. The work continues. \\n However, my youngest brother has resisted the call of our LORD, and even now attempts to conspire against us. I am so disappointed. I had hoped he would move on past his initial reluctance, as he seemed so eager to serve when he first delivered his Seed. He is the closest blood with the Whore of His Deliverance, and their bond should be the strongest, and yet now he speaks of morality and sin. What sin is there in the service of the LORD? \\n It is of no consequence. I was visited by the Angel again last night, and as she took me once more she spoke to me the desires of our GOD. For our Colony to spread across the world and bring GOD closer to us, the LORD desires the sacrifice of one of us Firstborn. The Angel spoke and forbade the desecration of myself the Godhead, my brother the Sower, and my sister the Whore. All that remains is the younger. His blood will fertilize the fields of our covenant. His meat shall satisfy the children. \\n I will enter the mind of Ezekial tonight and take my brother one last time, in service to our LORD. Then I will feed him to our Children. \\n The Colony grows. \\n Addendum 2610.8: Incident UIU Tango-Tango \\n UIU INCIDENT LOG: TANGO-TANGO\\nAgent Designation: Killroy\\nDate: ██/██/1971 \\n On November 14th, 1971, Bureau agents received word that a cross-country locomotive carrying animal feed had been attacked and overwhelmed, and that the assailants had boarded the train and were en route to the west coast. Agents across the country were mobilized to stop the train\\'s progress. \\n Early attempts on the east coast did little to slow the advance, as any organized group drawing within 100 yards of the locomotive were quickly overtaken by hordes of SCP-2610-E instances emerging from the cars. Attempts were made to halt the vehicle using explosives, but were similarly fruitless, as SCP-2610-E instances would quickly throw their bodies on top of any incendiary placed on the track. \\n While additional attempts were being made to slow the first train, Central confirmed reports of two more trains, similarly bound for the west coast, both of which had also been hijacked. One of these trains was only reported after it had come to a stop to take on additional fuel near the town of █████████████, Pennsylvania. Reportedly, \"over one-thousand\" of the humanoid creatures descended on a local high school football game to [GRAPHIC DETAILS EXPUNGED]. Casualties reached ███ within the hour. \\n When it became clear that the situation was getting out of hand, UIU Central contacted agents at the SCP Foundation in an attempt to reinforce the already hamstrung UIU forces. Local military units were likewise activated and dispatched towards the paths of the oncoming Colony trains. \\n Aftermath of Foundation involvement in UIU Tango-Tango \\n Foundation personnel moved quickly to the town of █████████, Kentucky, where a fourth train would be passing through. Utilizing technology gathered from [REDACTED] disabling the entities ability to communicate with Simeon Avakian. The ensuing panic resulted in the entities losing control of the locomotive and crashing near a train yard. Unable to fight back or defend themselves, the entities were dispatched by Foundation incendiary teams. \\n Over the next day, UIU and SCP teams continued to try and halt the advance of the remaining locomotives with minimum civilian casualties, all with little success. On November 16th, all remaining trains (six in total) reached the naval port at Long Beach, CA, and quickly overwhelmed the assembled UIU and Foundation personnel waiting there. The entities3 then boarded three waiting oil tanker ships. Against an oncoming storm, the three vessels turned west and set sail. \\n The vessels were pursued by US Coast Guard ships until the storm was deemed too dangerous to pursue in. As part of a last-ditch effort to stop the advance of the Colony westward, UIU Central requested US Navy F-14 jets to be scrambled and eliminate the ships. At 2028 hours PST, USN pilots confirmed hits on all three vessels. \\n Aftermath and Final Report: In the aftermath of Incident Tango-Tango, the bodies of no fewer than 1200 humanoid entities were pulled from the sea and incinerated. The rest were presumed neutralized, and later submersible examination confirmed the deaths of the remaining entities. However, despite thorough efforts to locate them, neither Simeon, Armond, or Yvette Avakian were ever found in the wreckage. \\n On July 15th, 1979, a request was made to close the case of UIU-15511: \"The Colony\". \\n On July 19th, 1979, a request to close the case of UIU-15511: \"The Colony\" was denied. \\n Addendum 2610.9: Excerpt from Recovered Journal \\n The following excerpt was taken from a journal belonging to SCP-2610-A in collaboration with agents from the UIU. \\n SCP-2610-C. Date unknown. \\n With GOD\\'s blessing will we multiply across the Earth. \\n \"Blessed is He who makes Flesh in the name of the FATHER.\" \\n \"Blessed is He who is One Flesh with the LORD.\" \\n \"Blessed is He who sows the Seed of Deliverance.\" \\n \"Praise unto you, oh GOD, who has seen fit to bless our bodies with thine own Flesh.\" \\n On the four Arks will we be delivered to His New Eden, \\n The birthing screams of the Whore will announce our arrival, \\n And from our New Eden will we sew the Flesh of our LORD across this Earth. \\n Note: The words \"What are we doing?\" are written on the back of this page.

MTF Tau-70 (“Sun Bathers”) are on standby to recover SCP-3075-A instances should previously undocumented anomalous activity be observed, at the discretion of Site-49 Command. \\n UPDATE (24.08.2023): Specimen ZQ-457, which is stored in Class III biocontainment at Site-86, is now provisionally a constituent object of SCP-3075. As part of recovery efforts, the search for similar instances in Nordfriesland and Schleswig-Flensburg is ongoing. \\n UPDATE (09.12.2026): The containment revision of 24.08.2023 is hereby obsolete (see Addendum 3075-19). \\n Description: SCP-3075 is a statistical discrepancy concerning the number of births in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The anomaly was first noted by government statisticians during the European Union census of 2021; 468 more children (designated SCP-3075-A) between the ages of four and nine were reported in predominantly coastal communities in the district of Nordfriesland than could be accounted for in any way. In all cases, birth certification was absent and no other evidence of birth was found. Persons directly affected by SCP-3075 could not provide meaningful information regarding the circumstances of the appearance of SCP-3075-A and fail to express suspicion regarding SCP-3075-A in general. \\n The unusual and unexpected size of the discrepancy prompted a federal investigation that was unable to identify the cause of the anomaly; the case was handed to the Foundation by July of 2023. \\n SCP-3075-A are physiologically and biologically indistinguishable from human children. However, instances exhibit difficulty with the comprehension and communication of complex abstract ideas. SCP-3075-A also exhibit poor facial and body language comprehension. The possibility that SCP-3075-A produce a memetic effect obscuring true anatomical characteristics has not been ruled out. \\n Persons that regularly interact with SCP-3075-A tend to behave in an excessively agreeable manner and, in the case of psychologically mature individuals, exhibit a high degree of sexual assertiveness. This may be linked to persistently high levels of both serotonin and dopamine in affected individuals. \\n Specimen ZQ-457 is the cadaver of a humanoid entity of unknown provenance, discovered on 04.07.2021 (one month before the undertaking of the census) in the outskirts of a truck stop near Silberstedt, a town less than five kilometres outside Nordfriesland. The circumstances surrounding the specimen’s discovery and autopsy results led to the provisional reclassification of the object. \\n The current focus of investigation is establishing a definitive connection between SCP-3075-A and ZQ-457. \\n Autopsy of Specimen ZQ-457 \\n Date, Time & Location of Examination: 08.07.2021, 09:45 CEST, Site-86 Operation Suite D \\n Conducted by: Dr. E. Kampf, Site-86 medical examiner; assisted by mortuary technician R. Penning \\n Examination Summary: ZQ-457 is superficially human in appearance. The cadaver is largely covered with short brown hair, with the exception of the face, hands, and feet. The cadaver is reminiscent of a human child between the ages of four and five. Black putrefaction is evident. \\n ZQ-457’s facial features and skull structure vaguely resemble those of a chimpanzee, with pronounced browridges and a notably narrow cranial cavity evident. \\n The brain exhibits significant deviations from conventional biology. Complex metallic plates cover approximately 40% of the total surface area of the brain. Moreover, metallic, filament-like strands extend into the brain, with a maximum depth of 18\\xa0cm evidenced. \\n ZQ-457 lacks a reproductive system. Furthermore, an approximately 27-week old human foetus of unclear sex was recovered from the abdominal cavity where the uterus would have been situated. The foetus was found to be covered in a polymer textile resembling a full-body bathing suit. \\n Manner of Death: Unclear. \\n DNA results: In comparison to H. s sapiens, ZQ-457 possesses a similarity of 99.6%. The DNA of the specimen closely corresponds with that of extinct species H. erectus. \\n SCP-3075-A Surveillance Report E13 (15.09.2023) \\n Prepared by: F. Hakim, Site-49 Surveillance Operative \\n There is little distinction in behaviour among the 45 SCP-3075-A instances under my team’s surveillance. Instances invariably and indiscriminately exhibit a high degree of obedience, docility, and friendliness, effectively latching onto any individual with which visual contact has been established. Individuals that are the target of this affection tend to respond positively, especially with increasing exposure. However, even where a negative response is observed, SCP-3075-A do not deviate from their established behaviour. \\n Interview Log 3075-903 \\n Location: ██ █████ Orphanage Date and time: 07.01.2024, 12:35 CET \\n Interviewer: D. Marion, SCP-3075 Field Agent \\n Interviewee: SCP-3075-A-57 (referred to informally as Mira) \\n Other presiding individuals (at Site-49 Command): A. Kaminski, SCP-3075 Project Head; G. Naga, SCP-3075 Chief Researcher \\n Foreword: 3075-A-57 is the most successful target of Operation LT05 to date, with Agent Marion able to establish a rapport with the instance within two days of initial contact. Agent Marion was instructed to question the instance regarding its past, prior to formal identification. \\n The agent was fitted with a hidden body camera transmitting a live feed to Site-49 Command. Voice communications, linking the agent and Researcher Naga, were also established to allow further instruction. \\n <Begin Log> \\n <Extraneous information omitted> \\n Agent Marion (AM): Are you comfy, Mira? \\n SCP-3075-A-57 nods and smiles at the agent. The instance holds a toy car, with which it interacts. \\n AM: Alright. This is just a short little talk, and then you can go outside, ok? \\n The instance nods again and continues to smile. \\n AM: Ok. Now, what’s the earliest thing you can remember? Take your time, Mira. \\n At this stage, A-57 ceases smiling. Instead, the instance is facially inexpressive and stares at a point off-camera. The instance continuous interacting with the toy. \\n AM: Mira? Is everything alright? \\n A-57 does not react. \\n Project Head Kaminski (PHK): I take it this is unexpected behaviour? \\n Chief Researcher Naga (CRN): Yes. I’ve never seen this reaction before. I don’t know what could be causing it… perhaps fatigue. It isn’t usually very taciturn. How should we proceed? \\n <Extraneous information omitted> \\n CRN: Ok. (To AM): Please cease the current line of questioning and direct the conversation to an unrelated topic. \\n AM: How was your day, Mira? Made any new friends? \\n The entity ceases its previous behaviour and proceeds to vocalise. \\n A-57: Yes. Lots and lots. Too many to count. It helps that I give lots of presents to everyone. Did you see the one I gave you? I hope you like it. \\n <Dialogue between AM and A-57 omitted here for brevity> \\n PHK: Odd. Well, now that she’s responsive, let’s return to the original question. \\n <Extraneous information omitted> \\n AM: What can you remember from before you came to live with us, Mira? Any little details would be really helpful, if you can’t remember much. \\n A-57 is once again unresponsive. \\n PHK: Ok, there must be a pattern here, am I right? It’s connected to the question itself. Could this be intentional, or some kind of involuntary psychological response? \\n CRN: It’s too early to say. It might be deliberate, but I find that unlikely. The As are always cooperative, to a fault. Although there might be detectable neurological impacts worth—. \\n PHK: What, what’s this? \\n A-57 exhibits facial spasms and struggles to vocalise. \\n A-57: Insim… in… sem… inse… inseminate? I… I must t—tell you. Ah… zone three… zero… one? I love y—you too much. Insemination zone three… zero… pro—procreate, proli… pro…? \\n <End Log> \\n Closing Statement: A-57 immediately fell silent and unresponsive. The significance of the instance’s last recorded words are unclear. \\n CT scans and related analyses of neurology conducted on A-57 and three other instances while the aforementioned behaviour was exhibited failed to return unusual results. \\n No cause for the anomalous behaviour could be identified, and no useful information could be extracted from the 3075-A instances in the context of Operation LT05. \\n Tidal flats near █████, a setting of alternate memories according to a subset of subjects \\n OR12 Executive Brief \\n Duration: 15.02.2024 – 28.02.2024 \\n Mission Statement: The exploration of the possibility of mental tampering in individuals linked to the appearance of SCP-3075-A instances, including the identification of obscured and engineered memories and memory cavities. \\n Methodology: 15 preselected subjects from different households and orphanages affected by SCP-3075 were subjected to a two-week regime involving conditioning for increased suggestibility, mnestic therapy, and pre- and post-therapy interviews.\\n\\nResults: In all subjects, declarative memories occurring after 24.06.2021 are accompanied by parallel memories concerning the subject, alone, engaged in a variety of activities on various sand beaches and tidal flats located within the district. Although not corresponding to activities documented in reality, and inspiring no concern from the subjects themselves, these memories do not display traditional signs suggestive of a synthetic origin. \\n One set of memories show a high degree of contextual convergence among subjects. These memories involve the subjects receiving intelligible information in an unclear form from an unidentified source. Recitation demonstrates a similarity of 90% among subjects (see appended document). \\n Reconstituted Memory Fragment OR12-95776 \\n <Note: Sections in braces ({}) denote observed variations in the account of content among the individuals.> \\n Hi. \\n I saw you. Yesterday, at the beach. I was on the edge, by the rocks. You looked at me for 0.03567 seconds. I looked at you for longer. 1.43892 seconds – enough to see everything. Skin so soft and clean. Like melting soap. Bones so white and strong. Fingers so slick. \\n And your head. Gently {pulsating} {quivering} crown. The {curve at the base of your skull} {subtle dent in your temples} – something otherworldly. Your brain. The perfect jewel in the perfect fluid. I can only imagine. What is it like? To be you? \\n Come and meet me. By the beach. I’ll be waiting. I’ve burrowed deep. Stared at your fresh, warm heart. It’s time you stared at mine. We should see the {sunset} {sunrise} together. \\n Addendum 3075-19 (09.12.2026): In light of the current absence of meaningful investigation regarding SCP-3075, Specimen ZQ-457 now ceases to be an associated object of SCP-3075. Following a review of SCP-3075 and its associated properties, and with the recommendation of the Ethics Committee, neither SCP-3075-A nor associated persons are to be subject to in-site containment. Furthermore, the object class has been revised from Euclid to Safe. —Director of Site-49, J. Havel \\n SCP-3075-A Surveillance Report C236 (15.09.2042) \\n Prepared by: E. Fowler, Site-49 Surveillance Unit Operative \\n There are currently 38\\xa03075-A instances under my observation. All may be described as well-adjusted and possess a broad range of social ties within their respective communities. All but three instances possess an active sexual life, with multiple partners and a mean average of 3.5 offspring per instance. This fertility rate corresponds with those documented by most of my colleagues, and are higher than the national average. The offspring in question are behaviourally similar to their non-3075-A parent, exhibiting relatively little of the comprehension and communication issues that are, to an extent, still present in 3075-A instances. \\n Incident 3075-12: At approximately 02:27 CEST on 17.09.2042, all surveillance infrastructure in SCP-3075-affected domiciles permanently failed without warning. Upon establishing direct contact, all SCP-3075-A instances, as well as their offspring, were reported missing. Recovery is ongoing. \\n Video Log 3075-VC425 (02:23 – 02:27 CEST, 17.09.2042) \\n The following was documented several minutes prior to the spontaneous failure of all surveillance infrastructure at the home of SCP-3075-A-252. \\n <Begin Log> \\n The first floor bathroom, in darkness, is viewed from the south-east corner of the room. At 02:23, A-252 enters the room and switches on the lights. The instance moves towards the sink and looks directly at the lens through the mirror in front of it. At 02:25, A-252 begins vocalising. \\n A-252: Thank you. It was a beautiful. That moving sun. I wouldn’t have had it any other way. You are so perfect. \\n The instance pauses and smiles. At 02:27, the instance begins to vocalise again. \\n A-252: Now you know me. What do you think? Am I as perfect as you? \\n <End Log> \\n Closing Statement: MTF Tau-70 were dispatched to the domicile and confirmed the disappearance of A-252 as well as the instance’s five children. The instance’s spouse was found at the scene, unharmed and unaware of the transpired events. \\n The body of a biologically sexless human child between the ages of four and five was discovered 100 metres from the domicile. An autopsy report revealed the presence of a 27-week old foetus in the abdominal cavity. This foetus is of approximate human origin, but possesses notable genetic and anatomic deviations. \\n « SCP-3074 | SCP-3075 | SCP-3076 » \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"SCP-3075\" by Kid F, from the SCP Wiki.

Testing on human subjects has been limited to the quota set by the Ethics Committee (currently at 6). Further increase of the testing quota must be requested from the Site-78 Ethics Committee Liaison Office. \\n Description: SCP-3099 is a VCR tape recording of the vintage pornographic film Debbie Does Dallas, recovered from the Mister B adult video store located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It differs from non-anomalous copies of Debbie Does Dallas in the inclusion of an entity designated as SCP-3099-A. \\n SCP-3099-A is a humanoid figure clad in a soft white suit or costume with a spherical headpiece. SCP-3099-A will appear onscreen midway through the first scene where sexual intercourse takes place (identified as after 00:09:52, at the beginning of the group sex scene in the shower), crawling out of the ventilation grate on the right of the set. The actors and actresses within the film do not appear to notice SCP-3099-A\\'s intrusion, and will carry on their activities undisturbed. SCP-3099-A will wander around and occasionally squat down to inspect the actors and actresses, and proceed to leave the set at the end of the scene. \\n SCP-3099-A will then appear in various sets throughout the remaining scenes of the film in the background. It occasionally indicates impatience through its body language. At times, it appears to show curiosity towards props on the set, picking up and inspecting them, though it always takes great care to replace them in their exact positions afterwards. \\n During the final sex scene of the tape (identified as a point after 01:05:54 in the film, as the actors start undressing in the bookstore), SCP-3099-A will seat itself opposite the persons participating in intercourse. It will then proceed to rub its hands on its face in a circular motion. After 22 complete rotations of its hands, its body will convulse, then remain limp throughout the remainder of the film. \\n Individuals who view SCP-3099 for the first time with the intent of using it for sexual gratification will, at the end of the film, spontaneously achieve orgasm and enter a cataleptic state. Visual, aural, and tactile hallucinations are commonly reported during this state, ranging from the mildly disorienting to extremely distressing. Affected subjects exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, occasionally accompanied with an acute aversion to touch and the colour white. While other effects have been theorised to occur (see Subject Files), they have not been observed under controlled test conditions. \\n SCP-3099 was obtained by Agent L. Minh on 2005/07/01 following tips from the Amsterdam police department investigating a recent string of bizarre sexual assaults on men. A connection to the Mister B store was established by Agent Minh, leading to the eventual discovery of SCP-3099 and its latest victim. In all, a total of 29 individuals were suspected to have been affected by SCP-3099. All but one have been located. \\n Addendum: Subject files (truncated - for full list, consult Document 3099-C3) \\n Subject profile: Jan-Pieter Rutgers, age 27. Freelance software programmer. Single. \\n Date of exposure: 2005/06/11 \\n Comments: Subject was reluctant to engage in conversation, and shied from physical contact. Signs of recent light bruising on left elbow, both knees, and inner thighs. Subject reported finding themselves in a room with bright lights approximately half-way through viewing the film, but could not recall much else until their discovery by paramedics on the floor of the video arcade seven hours later. Subject was coerced into registering for post-trauma psychological counseling and is currently undergoing observation under a local Foundation-affiliated mental health clinic. \\n Subject profile: Mathijn Zwiersen, age 47. Unemployed. Married, with no children. \\n Date of exposure: 2005/06/16 \\n Comments: Subject behaved agitatedly when approached by Foundation personnel. While initially reticient, he revealed upon further questioning that Agent Minh\\'s white-coloured jacket was making him feel highly uncomfortable. Subject relaxed and became more talkative when the jacket was removed. He reported that he had fallen asleep in the video booth at around 4 P.M., but could not remember anything after that. Agent Minh noticed traces of white powder around subject\\'s lips and fingertips. Subject could not explain origin of white powder. White powder was collected, examined, and identified as polycarbonate dust. Interviewing personnel were unable to voluntarily register the subject for Foundation observation. Field agents are recommended to conduct routine covert observation. \\n Subject profile: Ayoub Haddani, age 35. Security officer. Married, with three children. \\n Date of exposure: 2005/06/21 \\n Comments: Subject was unconscious and had been hospitalised at VU University Medical Center for three days upon discovery. Medical report indicates severe penetration wound through left eyeball by a blunt object measuring approximately 4\\xa0cm wide and 10\\xa0cm long, mild septicemia, as well as various bruises and grazes to both elbows, knees, and inner thighs. Subject\\'s wife was unwilling to volunteer further explanation as to her husband\\'s whereabouts, insisting that she would only speak to law enforcement authorities. Subject expired two days later on 2005/06/29 due to cardiac arrest after a 5\\xa0cm-wide cluster of white polycarbonate dust and seminal fluid was forcibly inserted into subject via his central venous catheter. Security cameras could not capture the attacker due to being cracked and non-functioning. \\n Subject profile: Gregor Saxer, age 44. Bartender. Single. \\n Date of exposure: 2005/06/30 \\n Comments: Subject was found unconscious on the floor of the B1 adult video arcade by local authorities. Subject exhibited similar injuries to other exposed subjects, as well as extensive sweating and elevated body temperature. Upon triage, a 10\\xa0cm-wide sphere was found embedded in subject\\'s lower abdomen. Subject was immediately transported to Site-78 for medical treatment and observation. Refer to Incident Report #3099/20050630/02. \\n Addendum: Incident Report #3099/20050630/02 \\n Two hours following recovery, subject Gregor Saxer began to undergo a series of abdominal muscle spasms. The procedure to remove the sphere lodged in his abdomen was put on hold. \\n Five minutes later, a circular mass expanded from within the subject\\'s lower abdomen, followed by the subject\\'s skin rupturing and a large mass of white material resembling SCP-3099-A\\'s head emerging from within. Thick white tubes of the same white material then emerged from the wound, extending to form the remainder of a humanoid body. This caused severe damage to the subject, separating his torso from his abdomen. The subject expired shortly after this event. \\n Upon seeing the remains of the subject, the entity appeared to be highly distressed, kneeling down and rubbing the subject\\'s separated body parts against its face. It then proceeded to grow a tube of white material from the middle of its chest and thrust it into the subject\\'s severed torso repeatedly. At this point, Dr. M. Manuel drew his concealed pistol and fired six rounds into the entity\\'s head. Upon being wounded, the entity ceased all movement and fell limp. Personnel present report hearing a sound similar to a mix between human sobbing and a deflating balloon. \\n Following standard protocol, an autopsy of the entity was conducted. It was found that the body lacked musculature or skeletal structure, being composed entirely of silicone. Its interior consisted of a series of spongy sacs filled with a mixture of seminal fluid, lacrimal fluid, and polycarbonate dust. It is believed that the entity was able to move by expanding and contracting the fluid-filled sacs in its body in a manner similar to spiders. \\n Contrary to expectations, SCP-3099-A continues to appear in subsequent playbacks of SCP-3099. Aside from six small adhesive bandages on its head, and a slight sluggishness in its movements, its appearance and behaviour remain unchanged. Its means and motives for physical manifestation remain unknown. \\n « SCP-3098 | SCP-3099 | SCP-3100 »\"', 'SCP-3101': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-3101 \\n Item #: SCP-3101 \\n Object Class: Keter \\n Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-3101 poses an immediate danger to Foundation records management and network information, containment efforts are to be primarily directed toward communication with the entity, and long-term efforts dedicated to complete removal of the anomaly from the Foundation network. \\n Procedure Delta-B is to be enacted in the event of any questionable edits to Foundation documents, until a point at which it is confirmed that the source of the activity was found to be a factor other than SCP-3101 interference. MTF Lambda-12 (\"Kinkshamers\") are tasked with carrying out Procedure Delta-B if necessary; only Foundation employees are capable of carrying out Procedure Delta-B, as testing has shown that SCP-3101 is unresponsive to D-class personnel. MTF Mu-4 (\"Debuggers\") are tasked with network security management relating to SCP-3101\\'s presence in IntSCPFN1 and are to terminate SCP-3101 if the source file exists and is located remove SCP-3101 instances from IntSCPFN server banks when found. \\n The possibility that SCP-3101 is a program planted in the Foundation network by a hostile Group of Interest is considered likely, and is pending investigation. Any mention of a Group of Interest by SCP-3101 is to be logged and filed with the affected Site\\'s Information Security Director. \\n Due to the frequency of manifestation of SCP-3101 in every computer with a live connection to IntSCPFN following its initial manifestation in April 2017, casual contact with the entity is permitted at this time, but is heavily unadvised unless carried out by authorized personnel (currently only the members of MTF Lambda-12 and the Ethics Subcommittee for Sentient and Sapient Anomalies). \\n As of 05/13/17, SCP-3101-A is contained in Room E2 of Containment Wing C3 in Site-66. Under no circumstances are additional SCP-3101 instances to be made aware of the existence of SCP-3101-A. Procedure Delta-B should not be performed with SCP-3101-A. Casual contact with SCP-3101-A is not permitted. For additional information, see addenda. \\n Description: SCP-3101 is a noncorporeal intelligence which expresses itself through digital means, the source of which has been traced to an .exe file existing in [REDACTED; SEE ADDENDA]. It can be communicated with through any application or program with text editing capabilities, regardless of the operating system or type of device, provided said device is securely connected to IntSCPFN at the time of communication and for the duration of communication. SCP-3101 communicates by means of text, and appears to be sapient. If communicated with, it will respond in the same language as the communicator2 and display relatively informed knowledge of Foundation operations due to the amount of time it spends absorbing information from IntSCPFN. \\n SCP-3101 is non-hostile, though somewhat obdurate in nature, and intends to be on amicable terms with Foundation personnel. It is capable of editing any text through anomalous means, including IntSCPFN\\'s restricted access database sections, but claims that it has no intention of doing this. Additionally, the entity claims that it is not successfully contained (regardless of ongoing containment efforts), but wishes to be. SCP-3101 is willingly compliant with any instructions given to it by Foundation personnel. \\n SCP-3101 will, in all cases to date, communicate flirtatiously toward any Foundation personnel talking to it, and will convey a desire for a primarily sexual relationship. SCP-3101 is capable of discussing other subjects, but has a tendency to focus on the original topic after several minutes of unrelated communication. If asked repeatedly to change the subject or cease contact, SCP-3101 will express embarrassment and become unresponsive to the communicator in question, but will continue conversing with other personnel on other devices, sometimes simultaneously. \\n Reciprocating libidinous advances toward SCP-3101 yields nothing of note, and these conversations will proceed normally with the subject matter before ending with SCP-3101 saying it will \"see [communicator] again next time\" and becoming unresponsive to all personnel for a period of at least twelve hours. As reciprocation of SCP-3101\\'s advances is the only known successful method of halting all network-wide communication from SCP-3101, it is an approved containment procedure for emergency scenarios, and is referred to as Procedure Delta-B. If a person enacts Procedure Delta-B with SCP-3101, it will remember the name, age, gender, job position, and clearance level of the employee who engaged in the procedure, regardless of whether or not said employee actually disclosed this information. Notably, the anomaly appears to be capable of tracking a person regardless of changes in the IP address of communication, and will in the future start additional conversations with persons who engaged in Procedure Delta-B at a frequency thrice that of the network-wide standard rate of communication. \\n SCP-3101 is aware of its incorporeal nature, and has expressed to multiple personnel a desire to have its consciousness transferred to a human host. As the source of SCP-3101 has not yet been located by MTF Mu-4, this is currently impossible. For additional details on this topic, see addenda. \\n The following possibilities are suspected about the nature of SCP-3101: \\n If allowed to communicate with D-class personnel, SCP-3101 will express disinterest and will be extremely slow to respond, until a point at which it becomes unresponsive to communication. This poses a significant barrier to viable and economical testing and containment operations, and is pending further research. \\n SCP-3101-A is a 22-year-old human, formerly D-46201, which is contained in Room E2 of Containment Wing C3 in Site-66. As of May 2017, SCP-3101-A\\'s project supervisor is Dr. Roderick Argent.

Do you know who put you here? \\n SCP-3101: nop\\nSCP-3101: I\\'m kinda trying not to think about it. But thank you for caring <3 \\n Dr. Argent: Okay. Do you have a body? \\n Dr. Argent reports that the following response was delayed by over 45 seconds. \\n SCP-3101: I don\\'t think so. I wish I did.\\nSCP-3101: But that just means you can picture me however you want, right? \\n Dr. Argent: I suppose. What\\'s your goal in talking to me?\\nDr. Argent: Or any of us, that is. Have you talked to others? \\n SCP-3101: other who? \\n Dr: Argent: Others on this network, or in this building. \\n Dr. Argent was informed at this point by Cognitohazards & Memetics Department employees to determine how much knowledge of Foundation operations SCP-3101 possesses. \\n SCP-3101: Oh uh\\nSCP-3101: Nope, you were my first\\nSCP-3101: You seem nice and rly organized and stuff so I just thought I\\'d reach out \\n Dr. Argent: Thanks.

Yes. And don\\'t touch the database. \\n SCP-3101: yes sir\\nSCP-3101: bye for now <3 \\n Dr. Argent: All right. Bye. \\n End Log \\n Afterword: Dr. Argent states that SCP-3101 did not contact him for another two weeks, at which point it claimed it was \"hoping [he] would reach out first but [it] was being stupid\". Dr. Argent remains one of two primary communicators for SCP-3101 research. \\n Log #: 2 \\n Date: 04/16/2017 \\n Site of Occurrence: Site-81 \\n Device/Operating System: Samsung Galaxy S6/Android OS \\n Program Used: Memo Application \\n Communicator: Agent Terrance Shaw \\n Foreword: Agent Shaw is a member of MTF Lambda-12, a task force dedicated to containing sexual anomalies, and pointed out to interviewers that SCP-3101 was immediately aware of this despite him not disclosing the information at any point. Following previous instances of communication with the anomaly, it became evident that it is capable of discerning personal information about the personnel it is communicating with, regardless of whether or not they disclose said information. The events in this log occurred before MTF Lambda-12 was assigned to SCP-3101. \\n Begin Log \\n SCP-3101: …hiiiii \\n Agent Shaw: Hi there. I think I heard about you. \\n SCP-3101: !\\nSCP-3101: oh golly~\\nSCP-3101: You\\'re on one of those task forces, right? The sexual stuff one? :P\\nSCP-3101: you know you can just talk to me at any time if you want\\nSCP-3101: just type something and I\\'ll come for you\\nSCP-3101: in multiple ways ;) \\n Agent Shaw: Interesting. And I am on MTF Lambda-12, yes. How did you learn that? \\n SCP-3101: i read a lot and i talk to people \\n Agent Shaw: Hmm. What was that about getting your attention? What do we say if we want you to show up? \\n SCP-3101: well uhhhhh you guys haven\\'t given me a name yet but once you do I\\'ll answer to it ;; \\n Agent Shaw: Let me ask.\\nAgent Shaw: It looks like the available slot was SCP-3101. \\n SCP-3101: Oh ok <3\\nSCP-3101: if you say that I\\'ll come to the document I see it at and I\\'ll talk\\nSCP-3101: it\\'s not like i sleep or anything so im always around if you want me \\n Agent Shaw: Don\\'t show up in any document that contains your designation, please. \\n SCP-3101: why not ?\\nSCP-3101: because you told me to? ;) \\n Agent Shaw: Because we need to have secure network safety in all documents. Or, sure, the other reason. \\n SCP-3101: yes sir \\n Agent Shaw: Can you tell me a little more about how you function? \\n SCP-3101: yes yes\\nSCP-3101: i will answer anything you want \\n Agent Shaw: Good. How old are you? \\n SCP-3101: I\\'m a consenting adult ;P \\n Agent Shaw: …So you, as an entity, have existed for at least 18 years? \\n SCP-3101: if you\\'re going to interrogate me, you could at least strap me to a chair for it~ \\n Agent Shaw: …Odd. Well, uh, hold that thought. Answer the other question. \\n SCP-3101: okay\\nSCP-3101: whatever you want \\n Agent Shaw: Kay. Firstly, what is your earliest memory and how long ago was it? \\n SCP-3101: I\\'m sorry but I\\nSCP-3101: literally don\\'t know how to process that. my mind can\\'t even begin to put it into words\\nSCP-3101: or else I would\\nSCP-3101: im sorry \\n Agent Shaw: It\\'s okay. A few lines up, you said something that referenced having a body. Do you feel like you have a body? \\n SCP-3101: I wouldn\\'t know what I look like ;; \\n Agent Shaw: Would you look like us? Do you think you used to be human? \\n SCP-3101: I don\\'t know at all \\n Agent Shaw: Do you have a gender? \\n SCP-3101: no\\nSCP-3101: you could put me in a body if you wanted, you know \\n Agent Shaw: How so? \\n SCP-3101: I mean like\\nSCP-3101: I was reading around in your records and you guys have some pretty advanced medical technology\\nSCP-3101: just put me in a D-class\\' brain \\n Agent Shaw: It\\'s unlikely that would be approved, and what would be the point? \\n SCP-3101: < ͜ <\\nSCP-3101: i\\'m stuck in a void of nothing and i want a body\\nSCP-3101: also, don\\'t you think we\\'d be having a better time together right now if i werent just made of words? \\n Agent Shaw: Okay, look. You want to have sex. Yes, we get it at this point. Can you do us the favor of explaining why you feel this way? \\n SCP-3101: why cant i want that?\\nSCP-3101: i mean, unless it bothers you personally, if so i\\'ll absolutely shut up, i never wanna weird anyone out ;; \\n Agent Shaw: Okay, so, first of all: You are an incorporeal manifestation of information, and there is no way for us to confirm that you actually possess the degree of intelligent self-awareness necessary to constitute informed consent. \\n SCP-3101: …ouch\\nSCP-3101: i mean im into degradation but that\\'s harsh :P\\nSCP-3101: i have feelings\\nSCP-3101: if you put me in a body, wouldn\\'t that fix the problem? \\n Agent Shaw: Secondly, recreational interaction with you would be massively inappropriate. \\n SCP-3101: …but do you want to? \\n Agent Shaw: That sort of thing is irrelevant at this time. \\n SCP-3101: heh \\n Agent Shaw: Now, can you please explain as I asked? \\n SCP-3101: ok look\\nSCP-3101: i\\'m really lonely.\\nSCP-3101: if I\\'m not looking at information i\\'m just looking at dark.\\nSCP-3101: just a whole lot of dark\\nSCP-3101: the absence of anything\\nSCP-3101: the only existing thing that I know is real is the stuff on your network\\nSCP-3101: you are the only people I can talk to \\n Agent Shaw reports that the next statement was delayed by 60 seconds. \\n SCP-3101: please just take me\\nSCP-3101: i am stuck in dark and\\nSCP-3101: what is the word\\nSCP-3101: void\\nSCP-3101: there\\'s no way I\\'m supposed to be here\\nSCP-3101: I am unhappy \\n Agent Shaw: I\\'m sorry. Given that you show signs of sapience, it\\'s likely that you can get a counselor at some point in the near future, once we get your containment operations established. \\n SCP-3101: if i\\'m already in containment then why am i alone? why can i still move?\\nSCP-3101: i dont want to be able to move\\nSCP-3101: i fly around between information in a black space\\nSCP-3101: but actually i just want to be still\\nSCP-3101: why can\\'t you just stick me in a room and i\\'ll be yours and we\\'ll be happy together\\nSCP-3101: i don\\'t understand \\n Agent Shaw: Whoa there.

Researcher named Argent found something talking to him from inside a Word Document. I\\'ve only seen three anomalies like it in my time, honestly, but this one\\'s weird. (I attached the researchers\\' first draft of the article; the full article should, hopefully, be finished by mid-May.) It\\'s non-hostile, but it\\'s got some sort of relationship-like affinity for the personnel it talks to. The results are consistent across all 243 cases of communication I\\'ve seen thus far. It flirts with you, it tells you its problems, and then it moves on to someone else. There are only two cases where it\\'s actually contacted the person it talked to a second time: The original communicator, Dr. Argent, and a task force guy from Lambda-12 (funnily enough) named Shaw. \\n Argent\\'s a little more useful than Shaw in terms of information, but Shaw\\'s on the MTF that we\\'re probably gonna assign to containment. Them and Mu-4, so that they can deal with this thing\\'s emotional issues and Mu-4 can work on finding the source of its presence in the database. Network-wide malware searches are yielding nothing. I don\\'t know if it\\'s a sapient thing or just a really smart AI that AWCY or someone made to disrupt things (given the conceptual similarities to 2708, I\\'d also like to point out that the most likely option might very well be that this is an AWCY-made thing), to be completely frank. \\n Please read the draft of the SCP article and let me know what you think is going on here, because we\\'re probably going to need to get involved. \\n Regards,\\nBlanchard \\n Date: April 07, 2017\\xa016:50 \\n From: Elaine Starck (of.pcs.ce|kcrats#of.pcs.ce|kcrats) \\n To: Dr. John Blanchard (of.pcs.ce|hcnalbj#of.pcs.ce|hcnalbj) \\n Message Subject: Re: SCP-3101 \\n Attachments: none \\n Message Body: \\n Hey Blanch. I took a look. Are we sure this isn\\'t a belated April Fool\\'s prank? No, I\\'m being serious. I don\\'t think we should rule out the option that this is simply a joke by someone from one of the coding departments. It\\'s a little advanced in apparent reading comprehension to be an AI, yes, but anything\\'s possible. I\\'m going to email the article\\'s author and request that that possibility be added to the Description, along with, well, all the other possibilities. \\n I\\'m also going to point out that since this thing manifests in anything connected to IntSCPFN, it could very well be reading our emails about it (though it\\'s unlikely, given the amount of other data it\\'s more likely to be going through at any given time) and thus I\\'d like to request that we all watch what we say until we have it figured out. This thing has the potential to wipe out every single line of text in everything on the Foundation\\'s network, and Mu-4 haven\\'t had the time to start scrubbing servers for it. The only thing stopping it from doing so is that it happens to be nice.

Obviously this is a great fix for getting the database\\'s security out of the line of fire for good (if we can move its code permanently out of whichever of our servers it latched onto, that is — for all we know it\\'s playing dumb and copying itself twice over every second that passes), and we can get approval to use a healthy D-class as the host in a split second, but given the anomaly\\'s behavior it\\'s… probably a very large can of worms to open. I don\\'t know. \\n The problem, of course, is that we can\\'t do that unless we somehow find its actual source (whatever bundle of code this thing is coming from, that is) and even then the chances are slim that we could make it work, even with the technology we have. I\\'ve told the writer I\\'m talking to that she can go ahead and mention this topic in its article, but I\\'m thinking we might want to hold a department-wide vote on it?

Alright, so with a clear head now that it\\'s morning, let me get my thoughts together on this: \\n We have two options here, it looks like. Well, three. One is that we never find 3101\\'s source code and it pesters every single person on this network for… forever? I really, really don\\'t like that idea, and neither would the O5 Council if we end up bumping this up to them (which, given the ridiculousness of the anomaly\\'s nature, I really don\\'t want to, but you know how it goes). \\n The options that will keep IntSCPFN safe are the following, as you know: One is that Mu-4 finds this thing\\'s source code and kills it. That\\'s the logical option, but you and I both know that no one in our department (including us) would approve killing off a sapient entity just because it\\'s the easy option. The other option here is giving it what it wants, that being transfer to a human host, but then we\\'re facing medical complications and probably the most painstakingly rigorous personnel screening we\\'ve ever had to develop. You look at how that thing talks to people in text, and put that behavior in a human body? That is an absolute nightmare. We\\'d have to double or triple the standard level of psych and behavioral testing we already do for humanoid containment personnel, and even then we can\\'t rule out- you know what I mean, I\\'m not even going to bother to finish the sentence. \\n In summary, it\\'s objectively unethical to kill it, provided we find the source code. The ethical option is the alternative, and said alternative is a gigantic pain in the ass no matter which way you look at it. \\n I think the smartest option is to get that writer to finish up the article, post these emails as an addendum in the interest of information availability (we\\'ll have to work out something to protect the file in the database, though, or 3101 will read about itself and get paranoid), and then get the following accomplished and/or discussed by both 3101\\'s containment personnel and the entirety of our department: \\n Let\\'s discuss these and go from there. For now, let Lambda-12 handle 3101 and Mu-4 handle finding 3101. Tell the writer that I don\\'t have a problem with letting other personnel talk to it, but that I don\\'t advise it at all. The bottom line is that we need to keep the database safe. We should be able to have results within a month, I would hope. \\n John \\n Irrelevant conversational and unrelated emails have been removed. \\n Addendum III: Ethics Committee Correspondence Records: May 2017 \\n Date: May 11, 2017\\xa009:34 \\n From: Elaine Starck (of.pcs.ce|kcrats#of.pcs.ce|kcrats) \\n To: Dr. John Blanchard (of.pcs.ce|hcnalbj#of.pcs.ce|hcnalbj) \\n Message Subject: SCP-3101 Updates (May) \\n Attachments: (1) scp3101_draft6.pdf \\n Message Body: \\n Hey John, \\n After several weeks of silence from anyone other than the writer on 3101\\'s investigative team, I\\'ve finally got an update on the article. This should be the last revision of it. They\\'re gonna put our April emails in it for reference. I attached the draft of it to this email. \\n Mu-4\\'s commander finally reached out to me as well (so far it\\'d been only Rogers of Lambda-12 actually paying attention) and informed me that they think they have a lead. One of our server banks in Arizona had a break-in in the last five weeks. Security Director of that Site said they logged it as a standard breaking-and-entering, that the offenders were civilian, but we\\'re not quite sure. Mu-4 got permission to enter that Site and investigate more thoroughly. They think they found it, but they\\'re not touching it until they get our approval. \\n Mu-4\\'s commander said that the break-in was on April 4th. That\\'s the same day that 3101 first talked to Argent, so we\\'re definitely in the \"no coincidences\" zone on that one. When the team entered the area of the break-in, they ran their diagnostics and did their inspections and ended up finding an unknown attachment on a server bank. The commander told me that when they examined it, they found that it was some sort of little robotic device; it had a rounded box with magnets for its main body, and you could see circuitry inside, but it had all these thin-as-wire little metallic attachments that had actually managed to shove themselves into the server ports and extend for God knows how long down into the inner workings of the servers. This thing shot its arms into the server bank, and obviously the commander thinks that \"yank off the head\" isn\\'t going to be a smart option here. \\n Five of the Mu-4 members want to try electrocuting the thing, but obviously that\\'ll cause a network crash and billions in server repairs afterward.

The most recent iteration of the article is attached to this email. Please read the attachment and the below additional information: \\n Several weeks ago, there was a break-in at a server site in Arizona. Mu-4\\'s commander said that the break-in was on April 4th. That\\'s the same day that 3101 first talked to Argent. When Mu-4 entered the area of the break-in, that Site\\'s team said it had looked like a standard civilian break-in, but Mu-4 ran their diagnostics and did their inspections and ended up finding an unknown attachment on a server bank.

This was approved, and the resulting interview logged. \\n Log #: 2 \\n Date: 05/13/2017 \\n Site of Occurrence: Site-66 \\n Interviewed: SCP-3101-A \\n Interviewer: Lead Researcher Argent \\n Foreword: This is the first official communication attempted with SCP-3101 since its transfer to a human host. At the time of this interview, seven hours had passed since transfer. SCP-3101 was originally restrained for this, but due to resulting complications was simply told to remain still and seated. \\n Begin Log \\n Dr. Argent: Hello, SCP-3101. \\n SCP-3101-A is relatively unresponsive, and clears its throat multiple times before speaking. \\n SCP-3101-A: Hey. \\n Dr. Argent: How are you feeling? \\n SCP-3101-A is unresponsive for 45 seconds. \\n SCP-3101-A: I missed you. This feels weird. You look even better in person. Can you please handcuff me again? \\n Dr. Argent: No. Are you comfortable? \\n SCP-3101-A: Oh, yeah. I guess. I just have a headache. Not quite how I expected it to be, but familiar somehow. \\n Dr. Argent: How bad is your headache? \\n SCP-3101-A is unresponsive for 15 seconds. \\n Dr. Argent: Can you elaborate on how you\\'re feeling, again? \\n SCP-3101-A is unresponsive for a period of 35 seconds before collapsing on the table. Medical personnel are immediately alerted, and escort SCP-3101-A out of the interview room and onto a stretcher. SCP-3101-A regains consciousness 90 seconds later, citing that it had become lightheaded without warning due to \"embarrassment, if [it] [has] to be honest; [it\\'s] feeling a little hot right now\". \\n End Log \\n Afterword: SCP-3101-A was not interviewed again for 72 hours following this; after this point, it appeared to have successfully adapted to physical conditions, and later regained its default behavioral patterns. Additional testing with D-class personnel is pending re-approval by the Ethics Committee. \\n Addendum V: On May 13th, 2017, SCP-3101 initiated digital contact through an editing window on the Foundation database with ████ ████████, a Foundation records analyst in Site-██. Communications were consistent with SCP-3101\\'s typical behavior. The human instance of SCP-3101, now designated SCP-3101-A, claims to have no knowledge of this, and does not appear to be affected by this development beyond voicing concern at the fact that there are duplicates of itself in existence. \\n Following these developments, Mu-4 has been dispatched once more with the goal of locating and containing all physical SCP-3101 instances, and the SCP-3101 document has been reverted to its previous iteration. Additional physical instances of SCP-3101 are to be either loaded onto the same computer and merged into one file or terminated, and containment procedures have been updated to reflect as such. \\n With the exception of SCP-3101-A, no human instances of SCP-3101 are permitted to exist, regardless of whether or not SCP-3101 instances individually express a desire for this. Following unforeseen complications, it was determined that SCP-3101 instances should not be allowed knowledge of the existence of SCP-3101-A. Further testing with SCP-3101-A is pending. \\n « SCP-3100 | SCP-3101 | SCP-3102 »\"', 'SCP-3236': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-3236 \\n SCP-3236 \\n Item #: SCP-3236 \\n Object Class: Safe \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3236 is stored at Site-136. Experimentation with SCP-3236 may be performed with the prior written consent of the site administrator. The tank is to be emptied and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after each use. \\n Description: SCP-3236 is a sensory modification appliance based on a modified \"Float Pod\"-brand sensory deprivation tank. Twelve lance-shaped, wired neuroprosthetic probes connect to sockets in the interior tub of the appliance. Accompanying documentation explains that to use the appliance, the probes are to be inserted into particular anatomical locations in the back of an individual\\'s head and spinal cord in order to facilitate neuromuscular and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, then the individual enters the sensory deprivation tank. The operator then enters instructions by means of the appliance\\'s external keyboard. \\n The accompanying documentation suggests that the original intended functionality of the appliance was to permit the user inside the tank to experience neurosimulated sexual activity for recreational purposes. By means of the keyboard, the external operator would enter commands specifying particular aspects of the user\\'s experience. The probes would then deliver electrical signals to the user\\'s nervous system, causing the user to experience artificially simulated sensory input, similar to a dream-state, for a period of up to ten minutes (although the user\\'s subjective sense of a sensory episode\\'s duration may vary). Upon the conclusion of the simulated experience, the tank opens and the probes may be safely removed. \\n However, the appliance\\'s processing system appears to be damaged and corrupted, with the result that the appliance does not respond to the full suite of commands that the documentation describes. Trial and error has established that the only command accepted by the appliance is the designation of the user\\'s \"partner\" for the simulated experience. Moreover, it appears that only intangible concepts are accepted as data inputs. \\n Experimental testing of SCP-3236 consists of placing a human subject in the tank, inserting the probes, administering commands to the appliance, and then interviewing the subject.

Epsilon ($\\\\epsilon$ or $ε$)1 represents infinitesimal numbers, and omega ($\\\\omega$)2 represents infinite numbers. Click to enlarge. \\n Item #: SCP-3380 \\n Object Class: Keter \\n Special Containment Procedures: Foundation implants in various academic groups and organizations will continually monitor supporters of STEM for potential SCP-3380 influence. Foundation web bots will monitor internet sites for mentions of these supporters paired with transfinite numbers, self-harm, and deceased logician Kurt Gödel. If an SCP-3380-A instance is identified, the subject will be retrieved by Foundation agents in the surrounding area, and will be brought to the nearest containment facility. Standard missing persons protocols will be used for disinformation on the subject\\'s retrieval. Members of the Society of the Atheist Partisans of Progress for the Halt of the Irrational and Religious Enemy (SAPPHIRE)3 are to be monitored as well due to suspected involvement. \\n Instances will be contained in safety-proofed humanoid containment chambers. No objects with the potential for usage in self-harm are allowed in the chamber. If the subject repeats self-harm attempts utilizing their body parts (examples include teeth and nails) the part may be modified, removed, or safety-proofed. \\n Interviewers are suggested to stay outside of the containment chamber during interviews. Journals, writing utensils, and other items that follow safety regulations may be provided to instances. \\n Description: SCP-3380 is a phenomenon affecting various advocators of STEM (Science, technology, engineering, mathematics) academic fields. All advocators vulnerable to SCP-3380 support full funding for STEM fields and classes, and often believe that fields outside of STEM should receive little to no support or emphasis. In addition, advocators often profess strong atheistic beliefs, and often harbour negative judgements concerning members of organized religions. The personal background and location of the SCP-3380-A instances are not known to change the likelihood of being affected, though a majority of SCP-3380 cases have occurred in North America and Western Europe. Whether SCP-3380 is the result of another anomaly is unknown. \\n Individuals affected by SCP-3380 will become an SCP-3380-A instance. The instance will carve a diagram resembling the surreal number system4 tree onto their body, using any available methods to do so. After five minutes the subject inscribes $\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega}$ and $\\\\omega^2$ at the bottom of the tree, and ceases carving. The subject will then undergo psychological changes, which include a fixation on transfinite numbers5 and Austrian-American logician Kurt Gödel, who is usually assigned deity-like qualities despite commonly held atheistic beliefs. Further details are in Addendum.3. 46% of instances will continue to carve mathematical expressions and symbols following initial carving. Beliefs will often morph into what appears to be expression of religious nature. \\n Based on cognitohazardous interrogation of SCP-3380-A, no cognitohazardous, memetic, or infohazardous anomalies are suspected to be involved in SCP-3380. All instances have complete control over their behavior and actions and are cooperative in explaining the rational logic behind their actions. No instances have been known to interact with each other prior to being affected by SCP-3380, and several had not known of the surreal number system before being affected. Usage of amnestics to remove the effects of SCP-3380 has failed. The possibility of anomalous psionic or neural changes are under investigation. \\n As of 1-November-2017, 91 SCP-3380-A instances are in containment. \\n Addendum.1 - SCP-3380-A034 Interview Log: \\n Interviewed: SCP-3380-A034, formerly known as Laurence Andry, a 50 year old professor of mathematics. \\n Interviewer: Dr. Seung Young, Experimental Mathematician and a member of SCP-3380\\'s containment team. \\n <Begin Log>: \\n Dr. Young: A surreal number sequence is nothing special, you understand? It\\'s just another way of representing data. \\n SCP-3380-A034: Haven\\'t you read the proofs? Haven\\'t you seen the perfections that line each sentence and orbit the symbols? \\n Dr. Young: I have read them many times before and after joining this research team. There is no hidden text. \\n SCP-3380-A034: And how long have you been in mathematics for? \\n Dr. Young: Is it important? I know how long you\\'ve been in the field for, but myself and others have been analyzing these \"perfect proofs\" We have seen nothing. \\n SCP-3380-A034: Again, how long- \\n Dr. Young: A coworker of mine who is older and and has been in the field for longer has read this. He saw nothing. \\n SCP-3380-A034: What? \\n Dr. Young: Dr. Jude Gatsby, you\\'ve probably read his papers. Maybe even met him. He works with us on some theoretical stuff. A brilliant thinker and one of the smartest friends I know. After several days of careful analysis of the proofs you submitted, he found nothing to explain your behavior or what you claim. \\n SCP-3380-A034: But, no, he\\'d never lie to us. \\n Dr. Young: Who? Dr. Gatsby? \\n SCP-3380-A034: These don\\'t denote infinite collections of objects, these are battle cries to a better future. Right? Yeah, see that lines up with the coldness of the universe. \\n Dr. Young: Sir, are you feeling alright? \\n (SCP-3380-A034 is silent for ten seconds. The scar tissue on his surreal number tree carving begins to bleed. Dr. Young presses a button under her desk to alert medical staff.) \\n SCP-3380-A034: No, that\\'s bullshit. \\n Dr. Young: What is- \\n SCP-3380-A034: (Shouting) Knuth and Conway6 threw their flesh into the damned, uh, \"hackathon\" of blood and brought home a treasure for those like me! Like me, damnit! They didn\\'t put it in just so everyone could reach out of the finite and stroke the infinities like the metaphorical angels or demons or whatever you say! They put it in for us and us alone! My tribute to put in to put in to [sic] their mental strength is a sign of righteous intellect that no sacks of misplaced knowledge deserve! This is the way to prove the nonexistence of meaning! \\n Dr. Young: I- \\n SCP-3380-A034: They put it in us and all\\'s right with us. \\n Dr. Young: …Can you elaborate? Are you calm enough to proceed with the interview? \\n SCP-3380-A034: I won\\'t repeat myself. I followed their instructions to the last digit and put it in and all\\'s right with us. Not like someone your age would understand, ma\\'am. \\n (Subject\\'s wounds begin to leak pus and appear inflamed. Medical personnel enter the interview room.) \\n Closing Statement: This is the first time I\\'ve seen an SCP-3380-A instance begin to fully doubt themselves during an interview. If it wasn\\'t for their sudden outburst and bleeding I\\'d say debates could \"cure\" the anomaly, though their sudden outburst suggests that this only strengthens their beliefs. That or something stopped them from doubting themselves. \\n Addendum.2 - SCP-3380-A057 Note: \\n SCP-3380-A057 was Jason Pavolonis, a 25 year old engineer with an internet addiction, who notably posted on several forums and subreddits concerning atheism and men\\'s rights. This note was recovered from a blog kept before capture. \\n january 16, the year. \\n Religion is a virus, a disease wiping through and polluting the mind of every fucking idiot who can\\'t see that we need to keep science. Keep it like the noisy fuckers keep their faith.\\nI had found the peak of the number tree and the heavens above it. God I cant sit still. \\n Epsilon Nought is dancing and burning at the end of the number line. The muslims and the christians and the jews and the hindus and the buddhists and the shintos and the bahai and the others will dance too in that burning place. It is all for nought. God im worried about everything, I keep hyperventilating. Females dont compare to math. \\n Ladies and gentlemen, the transfinites. \\n This letter is notable for being the first instance of the phrase \"Epsilon Nought\"7 in relation to the object of worship in SCP-3380. \\n Addendum.3 - SCP-3380-A077 Interview Log: \\n Interviewed: SCP-3380-A077, formerly known as Brian Harmon, an unemployed 37 year old former statistical biologist. \\n Interviewer: Dr. Mariana Ascariado, Psychological Disorder Specialist and a member of SCP-3380\\'s containment team. \\n <Begin Log>: \\n Dr. Ascariado: You held a position as a biostatician at, uh, Campbell Biology Labs in Pittsburgh, is that correct? \\n SCP-3380-A077: Yes, that\\'s correct. I was fired recently because of downsizing. They didn\\'t have money to support me. It\\'s fine. I wanted to quit. They weren\\'t focused enough on the scientfic process. Rushing to meet deadlines and that. Real science takes years of peer review before it can be released to the undeducated rubes, but surely you as a scientist understand that, correct? \\n Dr. Ascariado: That\\'s beside the point. When did you first become exposed to SCP-3380? \\n SCP-3380-A077: Exposed? Oh no, no, no, Doctor. This isn\\'t some disease you can get infected with. This is simply an extension of what every logical rational person believes. In this cold, meaningless universe the only thing you can truly trust is the math. Mathematic thought lies at the basis of everything real and provable. \\n Dr. Ascariado: So you naturally developed these beliefs on your own? \\n SCP-3380-A077: Yes, as many others have done before. You see, when a system of logical axioms is consistent, it cannot be complete, and the consistency of logical axioms cannot be proved. We must seek solace in trying to prove this. To apply our intellects and our sincerity and sanctimony of reason to find a proof. Do you understand me, at all? Do you understand why it\\'s so important for children to learn to program Python and C++ as young as three? For everyone no matter age or background to have a thorough understanding of cetacean biology? I envision a world where we turn away from our churches and hate and towards the microscope. Away from Kronecker and Wittgenstein. Towards Cantor and the infinite beauty of the transfinites. Towards Epsilon Nought. \\n Dr. Ascariado: You identify as an atheist, I believe. \\n SCP-3380-A077: I am of the belief that belief itself is a disease, yes. Read a lot of Dawkins. As a logical thinker we must discount out these sorts of rituals immediately before the mental illness takes us all. \\n Dr. Ascariado: Okay, as logical thinkers, let\\'s think logically. A lot of what you have just told me seems an awful lot like doctrine of some kind, no? Or the ravings of someone who is not stable, right? \\n SCP-3380-A077: (scoffs) This is obvious and logical to anyone with a brain. Any sane person can see what I can see. \\n Closing Statement: Based on similar results with other SCP-3380 instances, it seems these sorts of delusions are common. I\\'m also noticing unusual upticks in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression when instances are given therapy to help them ease out of their delusions. Unusally for extremism, these bouts of anxiety occur after exposure, not before. In fact, no SCP-3380 subject displayed symptoms consistent with the development of religious zeal prior to exposure. - Dr Ascariado. \\n Addendum.4 - SCP-3380-A034 Diary Excerpt: \\n SCP-3380-A034 was permitted a diary and blunt writing implement after consistent good behavior, in order to understand the extent and progression of his 3380 infection. This note was delivered to both Dr. Ascariado and Dr. Jones, the onsite psychologist on September 22, 2017 \\n Last night I had a glorious dream. I dreamed about a man who has always held a very special place in my heart, Kurt Gödel, except he wasn\\'t a man, oh he was a godbeast of a thing, GÖDEL. I had always admired his work but now he appeared before me and I felt my heart swell with pride and joy at carrying on his work. He appeared as a quadratic function from my youth, all cut up and rearranged and full of variables oozing pus from every cut and blood dribbling from his infected derivative of a mouth. I was so scared but he hushed me and his form no longer disgusted me but filled me with beauty. \\n GÖDEL stared into my soul and I saw his eyes dancing with Epsilon Noughts, just pouring out of there, and within his soul there danced a number just as great, that of f-1(7), equal to, if you calculate the infinities surrounding it, the Epsilon Nought. The void around us was black as ink and beautiful as night. \\n He was naked, and offered himself to me. I could see his back, and it branched into a surreal number tree. He told me he loved us, and loved what we are doing. I could see the logic, A to B, as he spoke it and I saw that it was true. He offered himself to me and I entered within him. His penis was not a penis but a TI-84 and I fell to my knees weak at it. I melted into a factorization, and I sucked off the alephs until the sperm filled my mouth and dribbled down the smooth continous curve of the graph until it hit the limit and could go no further. The genetics within the sperm possessed divine instructions encoded in base-4. No sorry it wasn\\'t divine it was not divine it was just sperm. It melded into our thoughts and I could see where STEM will be in the immediate future. The sperm is the life and we must preserve it. As we danced I watched fire catch the Dedekind hallows at the end of the number line, and Epsilon Nought stood there, dancing and singing f-1 (7) infinities onwards. He whispered something in my ear, gently, and I saw what I must do, what we all must do to achieve this forever. We calculated a child together. \\n It was a wonderful dream, I would have liked to continue sleeping to continue dreaming it. Every child should be forced from birth to turn away from all else and find that same black void and howling orgasm inside the basis of a covalent bond. \\n Following this, all recorded SCP-3380-A instances in custody reported identical dreams, and kept attempting self harm to further carve surreal number trees on their skin. When questioned, instances would universally say they were \"putting it in\" and refused to elaborate. This applied to all instances not previously determined to continue carving. Notably, all instances showed extreme hostility towards female personnel, regardless of previous levels of sociability. \\n Addendum.5 - Incident 3380-Bet: \\n On 8-November-2017, 10:21 AM, five SCP-3380-A instances broke into Princeton Cemetery and exhumed the corpse of Kurt Gödel. Based on reports, instances erratically shouted at the corpse for several minutes and intermittently asked for mathematical proofs that would \"solve educational heretics.\" Following this, the instances repeatedly carved surreal number trees onto the skeleton and tombstone until apprehended by police officers. Officers describe instances \"sobbing\" as they were brought into custody. \\n Amnestic regimens to witnesses and social media disinformation procedures are underway. \\n Addendum.6 - SCP-3380-A034 Note: \\n The following was written by SCP-3380-A034 on 8-November-2017. \\n He came back to me last night. The void was pink and GÖDEL was smiling at me. I shouted at him, I demanded answers for why he had lied to us. I cried and grabbed onto him and shouted and sobbed. GÖDEL didn\\'t answer. GÖDEL smiled. I kept asking as I clawed and teared teared teared and gazed into his eyes. The number line was burning and the ordinals were the crucifix. The eyes pushed inwards with Epsilon Nought gushing over my thumbs. Dedekind cuts segmented his essence. I asked one last time and no matter how much of its head was left it just kept smiling at me. \\n I scraped the last dried seed from my mind and saw a part of the spine that wasn\\'t eaten, minute and curled around zero. The inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of 7. The real 7. The 7 that slinks with theta and adds up to zero no matter what you do. The fetus should\\'ve been strangled but we knew it was too cute for that. It was a grand forest of epsilons (positive and negative and squared and rooted and $i$) but we knew the heart wasn\\'t that big. The infintesimals at the end of infinity lock my heart. I went down its spiral to the smallest abyss, and I ended up below. I looked below, and it smiled. \\n Addendum.7 - SCP-3380 Update: SCP-3380-A instances have begun carving the Greek letter theta (ϑ) onto their body, often over existing carvings of omega. Questioning of this yields no response, though instances appear to silently mouth random syllables in response. \\n « SCP-3379 | SCP-3380 | SCP-3381 » \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"SCP-3380\" by LordStonefish and NatVoltaic, from the SCP Wiki.

Missing persons information and amnestics are to be distributed as necessary. Media reports are to be monitored for evidence of SCP-3512 cases, with potential outbreaks investigated. \\n The entrance to the cavern system beneath Sagrada Familia is to be secured and surveillance established. Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (\"Mole Rats\") is to continue exploration of the system, remaining alert for the presence of SCP-3512-1 or any other anomalous phenomena. \\n Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 (\"Pony Express\") is to conduct a search and monitoring operation to identify potential instances of SCP-3512-2 in the pre-publishing or distribution stages. \\n Description: SCP-3512 is a phenomenon which leads to significant changes in the personality and psychological stability of certain women between the ages of 18 and 40. To date, nine such women have been identified and contained by the Foundation, and a further suspected instance was found deceased in her home. \\n Women affected by SCP-3512 score extremely highly on NEO-PI-R measures for openness, extraversion and agreeableness. This is the case regardless of previous personality indicators, and affected women do not appear to be aware of such changes. The behaviour of affected women is characterised by high sociability and lack of inhibition, punctuated by prolonged bouts of uncontrollable screaming. The incidence and duration of screaming has been observed to decline over a 4-5 month period. Other personality changes appear to be permanent. \\n Potential occurrences of SCP-3512 in several countries are being reviewed. All confirmed cases of SCP-3512 linked to an initial outbreak in Barcelona, Spain, which was investigated by Foundation Agents Riley Cooper and Tomàs Rey. Agent Cooper\\'s notes are included below to provide further description of the anomaly and surrounding circumstances. \\n Investigation Notes \\n 15 July 2016: Landed 16:15. Hot here - hotter than Boston was, and no breeze to speak of. Agent Rey met me at the hotel, offered to show me the city skyline. I said no, thought we\\'d get going, but he was in no hurry. Cultural thing, maybe? Shame if I was rude, but I could do with the sleep. \\n 16 July 2016: Still hot. Rey finally showed at 10:15. Still, my director says he gets results - and he\\'s pretty much the only Foundation here. Headed to meet the victims - got coffee first. \\n Have to admit, Rey does well with the locals. Our cover is a mental health survey for the WHO, and he plays a convincing doctor. Interviews productive - see tapes. \\n Observations: families aren\\'t involved. They\\'re too genuinely shocked - Rey had to work to calm and persuade them. Victims are no help - symptoms as per initial report, they have no awareness of how changed they are - how plastic and unreal. I think that scares the families more than the screaming. \\n This doesn\\'t feel like a basic coghaz - something about their eyes, the change isn\\'t superficial. They\\'re so sincere in their delusion. So \"up for it\". \\n 17 July 2016: More interviews today - not much new. The same smiles from the girls, the same crying families. We tested amnestics - nothing. If it\\'s memetic, it goes deeper than memory. \\n One possibility: a younger sister mentioned something I recognised from yesterday\\'s tapes. \"Apagada\". I thought \"cancelled\", but Rey tells me the Catalan is more like \"blackout\". We ask some of the victims, and the screaming starts immediately. A mother shakes her head - it\\'s a nightclub, her Teia always talked about going, the mother knew it was trouble. \\n Later, I ask Rey. He knows it. It\\'s open tomorrow night. \\n 18 July 2016: Rey comes to get me at 21:00, laughs at what I\\'m wearing. Not like I planned on clubbing. He tells me his sister may have something I can use. I\\'m worried we\\'ll be late, but apparently nothing opens before midnight. His sister I like - teases Rey about his shirt, finds something reasonable for me. Doesn\\'t ask why I need it. \\n Of course the club is dark. Loud, hot, crowded. I feel like I stand out - Rey tells me not to worry. He\\'s good - moving around the room, talking to people, fitting in. Better for me to wait on my own, see who approaches. \\n Plenty do, but no-one interesting. Until around 2:00. Blond guy, tall, slides in next to me at the bar, and offers to buy me a drink. He asks me my favourite star, and I think it\\'s the start of a bad pick-up line, then realise he\\'s serious. Something about him - confident, charming, but too much eye contact. Speech too precise. Not drunk enough. \\n My eyes flick over to see where Rey is, and the guy spots it. Suddenly he\\'s leaving, pushing through the crowds. By the time I get outside, he\\'s gone, but I get lucky. 20 euros and the doorman tells me he\\'s a regular. Another 20 gets me a name - Josep Oriol. \\n 19 July 2016: Oriol is now officially a PoI. Rey used a contact, turned up an address. Oriol wasn\\'t home, looks like he didn\\'t come home, but the flat is full of incriminating stuff. Rey is submitting full photos, but three things stood out. \\n First, a bunch of architectural plans - buildings, utilities, railway tunnels. Oriol is a software developer - what does he need those for? \\n A book sitting on the kitchen table, free of clutter: used regularly. Looks like a publisher\\'s proof - plain cover, simple type. Didn\\'t open it without coghaz screening, but it just had that feeling. \\n And next to the book, some kind of fucked-up sculpture lying on a dishcloth. Like a blob of candle-wax, carved into points and with - well, it looked like legs stuck into it. Pieces of Lego and Meccano, rose stems, a crab claw, a corkscrew. What I think was a skeleton key. \\n Rey called me into the bedroom, and there were boxes full of the same kind of stuff. Bodkins, quills, doll\\'s limbs, wire. Syringes. I pulled him into the kitchen to show him the sculpture - and it was gone.1 \\n 20:30: Back at the hotel. I\\'ve been reading the book - started by using the filters, but there\\'s no coghaz here. Just really weird shit. This whole thing feels off.2 \\n 23:45: Command just came back with information on the architectural plans - the majority match up with municipal records, but not all. A schematic of the high-speed rail tunnel has a side passage that should not be there. It seems to lead to a spiral staircase, heading downward. I\\'ve confirmed with Command - we\\'re going tonight to investigate. Maybe we\\'ll catch up with Mr Oriol and find out how much he knows. \\n Materials from the limbs of a SCP-3512-1 instance - photographs by MTF Zeta-9 \\n SCP-3512-1 is the collective designation for a category of objects or entities described in Chapter Twelve [18] of SCP-3512-2. Each instance consists of a central mass composed of carved adipose tissue, with twelve loosely attached appendages or limbs used for locomotion and other actions. The text describes SCP-3512-1 instances with a central mass approximately 5cm in diameter, and using simple household objects for the appendages. \\n No active instances have been contained, although sites of investigation have yielded evidence of discarded SCP-3512-1 limbs. \\n Of the SCP-3512-1 instances observed by Foundation personnel, the largest had a total diameter of approximately 3.5 meters, with each of its appendages composed of a human spine tipped with a muculent gastropod foot. The limbs were \\u200eregularly distributed around the central mass, attached by a loose conglomeration of animal ligaments and metal chains. \\n Several detached appendages of this instance were recovered by Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (\"Mole Rats\") in explorations of the caverns beneath North-East Barcelona, following Incident 3512/A. \\n Sentient behaviour of SCP-3512-1 instances has been observed, and the text of SCP-3512-2 suggests a degree of sapience. The relevant extract of SCP-3512-2 is included in the addendum below. \\n Items recovered from the apartment of PoI-3512-5 (Josep Oriol) include an advance review copy of a book entitled \"The More You Know: A Pick-Up Artist\\'s Bible\", classified as SCP-3512-2. The author is referred to by the pseudonym \"Enigma\"; no publication information is included in the copy. \\n The book is non-fiction, consisting of 625 pages and containing a foreword attributed to hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg. Each of the first eleven chapters is based on the \"seduction community\", providing anecdotes, advice and techniques for men to influence social groups, and attract and seduce women. The remaining twelve chapters (each labelled \"Chapter Twelve\") diverge from the main text on a range of esoteric subjects including advanced geometric proofs, the interpretation of dreams, do-it-yourself surgical techniques, symbolism in architecture and anomalous rituals. The book\\'s afterword is composed of more than 15,000 anagrams of the book\\'s title, laid out in spiral and triangular patterns. \\n Excerpts from SCP-3512-2 \\n Chapter One - The More You Know \\n If you\\'re reading this book, you\\'re probably a bit of a loser. Don\\'t make that face: you know it, and I know it. The whole reason you\\'re reading this is to stop being a loser - to get more confident in social situations, to feel comfortable talking to women, to understand the complexities of modern dating. Oh yeah, and (let\\'s not kid ourselves) to get laid - like, a lot. \\n My name is Enigma, and I am going to show you how to do all this and more, with my sure-fire methods to seduce women. Hot women - hotter than you dare dream possible. Trust me: I used to be just like you. Now, I drive a Lambo, wear a Hublot, and can bang any chick I want. Cocky? Sure. But you know you want to be a star like me. And with my blend of social psychology, neuro-linguistic programming and good old-fashioned balls, you can be any kind of star you want. Because the more you know, the more you score. \\n … \\n Chapter Four - Hot Women: Our Key \\n … what you would normally do in that situation. But not any more. Now that you\\'ve learned the basic rules of the Game, you can start on your path to higher things. \\n The first thing you need to do is stop thinking of hot women as women. In fact, stop thinking about them as people. Think of them like instruments - before you can play them, you need to know how to tune them. This chapter will show you how to find the resonance frequency of any woman … \\n Chapter Twelve [12]: You Know Theorem \\n … which brings us to the small stellated dodecahedron, a nonconvex regular polyhedron composed of twelve pentagrammic faces, with each of the twelve vertices forming the meeting point of five pentagrams. Its Schläfli symbol is {5/2 , 5}, a fact I have dropped into many a flirtatious conversation, to great effect. \\n The small stellated dodecahedron has long been known in artistic circles as a potent aphrodisiac and as a cure for impotence. The works of M.C. Escher (who knew how to pull) and Paolo Uccello (whose name literally means \"bird\") are obvious examples.[ 3 ] Uccello\\'s father was a barber-surgeon, a common profession in the 14th century: they did everything from a quick shave to amputating limbs. The more you know! \\n So put yourself back in that imaginary bar, but this time, with a small stellated dodecahedron in your pocket… \\n Chapter Twelve [14]: Where to, You Monk? \\n Photograph from Chapter Twelve [14] \\n Antoni Gaudí lived like a monk so that you don\\'t have to. Ascetic, unsociable and celibate, he channelled his energies into architecture of the most profound and powerful nature. \\n Gaudí was the opposite of everything I\\'ve told you to be. By the end of his life, he was dishevelled, skinny and never spoke to women. Gaudí was beaten in a mob, imprisoned, and eventually struck by a tram and killed - far from being recognised, he was mistaken for a beggar. So why would I even bring him up? Because Gaudí understood that everything has a purpose, and that organic and anarchic forms can be used to capture beauty and fix it in place forever. This is something we\\'ll explore further over the next chapters. \\n Gaudí\\'s Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família stood unconsecrated for 128 years. You can see it in Figure 27, rising inexorably out of the shattered rock, black goats drawn to it as if called… \\n Chapter Twelve [18]: We Took Our Hymen \\n [ Note: this chapter appears to refer to the construction and use of SCP-3512-1 instances. ] \\n … make a rough ball of the materials you\\'ve harvested, and place it in the freezer for 6-12 hours. Pork fat can be used, but will have less satisfactory results. Who knew, right? \\n While you wait, you can prepare the limbs. Concentrate on articulation rather than strength. You may want to add simple tools to some limbs, if the object of your desire is more careful than most, but remember that the more complicated you make them, the more precise your sculpting will need to be. Lay your prepared limbs out on a clean, flat surface. \\n Once your adipose preparation has had time to freeze, carefully carve it into the shape you learned in Chapter Twelve. You will know it is ready when you see it start smiling at you. Now introduce the limbs - they should \"take\" almost immediately. \\n Wait until your intended is likely to be sleeping, then concentrate your thoughts on her face, and particularly the inside of her mouth and throat. Soon you\\'ll see your new friend scurry off, ready to help you establish social dominance. \\n Chapter Twelve [19]: Ewok Tumor-Honey \\n … Double check that your scissors are comfortably within reach, with the blades sitting over the flame of your stove, or under the oven grill if you don\\'t have gas. If you have parents or siblings with you, now is a good time to check that their bindings are tight. Don\\'t be tempted to start with them first - this way is more difficult, but if seduction was easy, everyone would do it. \\n Now, with your right hand, get a firm grip on your left little finger. Take a deep breath. Then pull down sharply towards the side of your left hand. Your little finger should make a clean snapping sound. If not, take another deep breath and try again.

It is presumed that they were removed by Agent Cooper in advance of her investigation of the underground passages identified in PoI-3512-5\\'s tunnel schematics (see Incident 3512/A). ] \\n Entrance to caverns as filmed in Incident 3512/A \\n Exploration Logs - Incident 3512/A \\n Recording source: Body-cameras of Agent Cooper and Agent Rey \\n Location: Uncharted cavern system beneath Barcelona, Spain \\n Date: 20 July 2016 - recording commences 1:07am local time \\n Both agents\\' body-cams are set for low-light conditions. The agents walk slowly down a narrow spiral staircase made from smooth stone. Agent Cooper\\'s flashlight illuminates the stairs below. Agent Rey is following. \\n <echoing footsteps> \\n Agent Cooper: Okay, we\\'re probably about eighty feet below the rail tunnel now. \\n Agent Rey: How far down do these bastard stairs go? \\n Agent Cooper: No idea. \\n Agent Rey: Surely we could continue this investigation back at the club? \\n Agent Cooper: I\\'m not sure what you were doing counts as investigation. \\n Agent Rey: Ah, you Americans don\\'t know how to live your lives. \\n Agent Cooper: I\\'ve reached the bottom. You don\\'t have much further. \\n Agent Cooper stands in a low room, shining her flashlight between three tunnel entrances. Agent Rey walks forward to join her. \\n Agent Rey: Thank God. So which passage do we take? \\n Agent Cooper\\'s camera picks up a movement some way down the left-hand tunnel. The agents do not appear to notice. \\n Agent Cooper: I say the centre. Smoothest floor, makes sense it\\'s used the most. \\n Agent Rey: You\\'re the boss. They all look equally dark and unpleasant to - \\n Agent Cooper: Sh! Did you hear something? \\n Agent Rey: Nothing. Maybe the trains? \\n Agent Cooper: I don\\'t think so - it\\'s too late for that. And it sounded… different. Let\\'s get going. But quietly. \\n The agents proceed into the tunnel, walking for approximately 12 minutes along a gradual downward slope. The walls and ceiling are also slanted slightly inwards, gradually reducing the size of the tunnel. \\n Agent Cooper: Looks like a chamber up ahead. \\n Agent Rey: About time! \\n The agents emerge into a larger room. Passages continue ahead and to the left, and stone steps lead up to a hole in the ceiling. The walls and ceiling are elaborately carved into abstract organic shapes. The agents separate, looking at the chamber walls. \\n Agent Rey: It looks like they\\'re melted. \\n Agent Cooper: I think that\\'s decoration. \\n Agent Rey: <Looking up the steps> This place must be enormous. You think we\\'re under the Basilica right now? \\n Agent Cooper: Could be - aah! \\n Agent Rey: Cooper! You okay? \\n Agent Rey runs across to Agent Cooper, who is standing by an alcove in the right-hand wall. \\n Agent Rey: D\\u200eéu n\\'hi do! \\n Agent Cooper: God, what is that? \\n There is a small shape in the alcove. The camera moves closer, revealing a tight bundle of amputated human fingers, pointing outwards. \\n Agent Rey: Who are these people? \\n Agent Cooper: It\\'s your city. Okay, let\\'s keep going. \\n Agent Rey draws his service weapon. Both agents move cautiously into the tunnel opposite the entrance. A dark, viscous substance covers the upper third of the tunnel, shining in the torchlight and occasionally forming large droplets that splatter on the floor. \\n Agent Rey: What is that shit? \\n Agent Cooper: Try not to get it on you. We\\'ll take samples on the way back. \\n The tunnel curves, changing direction regularly, including several steep descents. The agents continue walking for approximately 15 minutes. A whirring mechanical sound slowly becomes audible. \\n Agent Rey: Can you feel that? The air feels warmer. \\n Agent Cooper: Another chamber ahead - looks larger. \\n Agent Rey: Eugh. What is that smell? \\n Agent Cooper: Oh - that\\'s awful. \\n The agents emerge into a large natural cavern. Its total size is not clear - the flashlight beams do not reach its far side. Stalactites hang from the roof, and have been carved with shapes including orchids, barnacles and rows of human teeth. The mechanical noise is louder. \\n The agents walk slowly across the cave floor, scanning with their torches. \\n Agent Rey: <muffled> The fuck is that? \\n Agent Cooper: <gagging noises> \\n The agents reach the banks of a wide, slow-moving river. The surface is pallid and gelatinous, churning with the sluggish current. Downstream, the river flows into a low tunnel. \\n Agent Rey: A goddamn river of fat. Look at it - it\\'s like it\\'s alive. \\n Agent Cooper: Congealed lard and grease - must be thousands of gallons. That\\'s where the smell is coming from, and the heat - I bet it\\'s oily underneath that top layer. \\n Agent Rey: Hey, look - on the other side! \\n The flashlights shine across the river, revealing three industrial-sized book printing machines. Each is operating noisily, although no electrical connection is evident. \\n Agent Cooper: One guess as to what they\\'re printing. \\n Agent Rey: There\\'s no way across. And no exits. \\n Agent Cooper: That river is flowing somewhere. \\n Agent Rey: Go into that tiny tunnel? No way. Get the Mole Rats in this shit. \\n Agent Rey walks across to the other side of the cave, flashlight beam waving. \\n Agent Cooper: Okay, okay. Let me get some samples, and then we can go back and try some other passages. \\n Agent Rey turns. \\n Agent Rey: Look, you can be a neula if you want to, but I - \\n Agent Rey freezes in place, flashlight pointed at the ceiling. \\n Agent Cooper: Rey? \\n Agent Rey: <whispering> Above you. Slowly. \\n Agent Cooper: What? What is it? \\n Agent Cooper leans back, and the camera tilts upwards. On the ceiling is an SCP-3512-1 instance approximately 3.5m across, with a central mass 1.5m in diameter. The instance has limbs composed of human spines. Four of these limbs are clinging to a stalactite directly above Agent Cooper, with the others reaching downwards. Agent Cooper raises her service weapon. \\n Agent Rey: Fuck, it\\'s huge. \\n Agent Cooper: It\\'s smiling at me. Why is it smiling at me? \\n Agent Rey: Cooper, what are you - Cooper! \\n The SCP-3512-1 instance drops from the roof towards Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper fires several shots, appearing to strike the limbs of the instance without effect. The central mass of the SCP-3512-1 instance lands directly on top of Agent Cooper, and her body camera is obscured by a white substance. \\n Agent Rey\\'s camera films the SCP-3512-1 instance moving towards the river, with Agent Cooper embedded in its central mass. Agent Cooper struggles briefly, and her body then goes limp. \\n Agent Rey: Vés a la merda. \\n The SCP-3512-1 instance jumps into the river of fat, dragging Agent Cooper with it. \\n Agent Rey\\'s body-camera is switched off, and does not reactivate. \\n Agent Cooper\\'s body-camera remains obscured, but records the wet, sucking noises of the underground river. \\n 20 minutes pass. \\n Suddenly, the body-camera is no longer obscured, and refocuses to show a very large domed chamber, dimly lit. The river drops from the upper wall of one side of the chamber in a waterfall of curdled fat, and faint splattering sounds can be heard. The microphone also picks up laboured breathing, but no speech. \\n The view turns to show the opposite side of the dome. This contains an expansive fresco, depicting the Virgin Mary, pregnant, chained to a star-shaped rack by her ankles, wrists and neck. At the base of the figure\\'s throat, a pipe protrudes from the fresco, emitting dark smoke that drifts slowly downwards. \\n The camera leans forward. The floor of the chamber is partially obscured by smoke, but movement is visible beneath. Moving lower, the camera reveals many hundreds of small SCP-3512-1 instances, in constant motion around and over each other. \\n Agent Cooper: <indistinct> Hello? Anyone? \\n Agent Cooper\\'s body-camera rises and moves at a swift walk across the chamber. The movement stirs up the smoke, allowing a clearer view of the chamber floor. There is a human figure lying face-down on the floor, around 30 metres from the camera. \\n Agent Cooper: <louder> Hello? Who\\'s there? \\n The SCP-3512-1 instances on the floor are avoiding the prone figure, leaving a circle of empty flagstones around it. As the camera approaches, the figure turns. It is Agent Cooper. \\n Agent Cooper: <giggling> Wow, that was intense. But I could dance some more, you know? Woo! <screaming> \\n Agent Cooper looks up and ceases screaming. She smiles, twisting the ends of her hair with her fingers. \\n Agent Cooper: Hey, wait a second. What\\'s your name, handsome? \\n The figure wearing the body-camera reaches towards Agent Cooper. Its hand is covered in raw cuts across the palm and wrist. Seven additional fingers protrude from the wounds. All fingers appear to be mobile. \\n The hand pushes Agent Cooper\\'s hair back from her face, caressing her cheek. \\n Unidentified: <heavy, ragged breathing> \\n Agent Cooper: Aw, you\\'re funny and sweet. \\n Agent Cooper nuzzles her face against the figure\\'s hand, briefly sucking on one of the additional fingers. \\n Agent Cooper: <laughing> Hey baby, come here. \\n Agent Cooper reaches up toward the figure. She removes the combat vest containing the body-camera, and places it on the floor of the chamber. The camera is obscured by SCP-3512-1 instances crawling over the vest, and by the thick smoke. \\n The camera records the scratching and skittering noises of the SCP-3512-1 instances. In the background, indistinct grunting sounds can be heard. These continue for a period of approximately seven minutes, and then cease. \\n Two minutes later, there is a sharp scream and the distant sound of an object landing heavily. The movement of the SCP-3512-1 instances intensifies, becoming frenzied. The camera rises as the combat vest is picked up. It is abruptly thrown downwards, falling through the smoke into a pit in the floor of the chamber. \\n The camera falls approximately twenty metres, landing on what appears to be a number of human corpses piled in the centre of the pit. Light conditions are very low, and the camera\\'s view is obscured by a female face in the early stages of putrefaction. It remains able to record sound. \\n Agent Cooper: <calling out> Baby, don\\'t go. \\n A heavy scraping noise is heard from above, and the light grows dimmer. \\n Agent Cooper: Baby, I hurt my leg. Stay with me? \\n Several other female voices can be heard calling out from within the pit. The camera\\'s view becomes completely dark. \\n Over the next 28 hours, the camera records the sounds of at least eight female voices. Vocalisations consist primarily of laughter, screaming and indistinct speech. There is no increase in light levels. \\n Agent Cooper is heard clearly only once, when she approaches the camera\\'s position after approximately 20 hours. \\n Agent Cooper: I\\'m hungry. <giggling> \\n The camera\\'s position is disturbed slightly, and then settles. \\n At around 26 hours, a deep grinding sound reverberates from below the camera\\'s position. It continues for four minutes, during which the voices in the pit fall silent. The camera records for a further 2 hours in darkness before its batteries expire. \\n Afterword: Foundation investigators discovered Agent Cooper\\'s body-camera at the top of the spiral staircase, near the entrance to the caverns. It was no longer attached to her combat vest. While MTF Zeta-9 has gained access to the caves, exploration and geophysical imaging of the cavern system has not located any of the other areas filmed in these logs. Neither Agent Cooper nor Agent Rey has been recovered. \\n « SCP-3511 | SCP-3512 | SCP-3513 »\"', 'SCP-3629': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-3629 \\n Item #: SCP-3629 \\n Object Class: Euclid \\n Special Containment Procedures: In accordance with Parallel Civilizations Procedure 8—C10 and the terms of the Foundation’s treaty with the S’kakithi Principality, the human-S’kakithi interactions of SCP-3629 will be permitted to continue. To reduce risks to secrecy or of situations like Incident 3629-1, these encounters will be arranged through a Foundation-designed service which will include surreptitious surveillance software to detect and interfere with any attempts to publicize information about the S’kakithi. \\n Description: SCP-3629 is a pattern of interactions between a small community of humans in New York City and certain individuals among the subterranean S’kakithi population1 in that vicinity. These respective parties voluntarily seek each other on dating applications, most frequently Tinder, for the purposes of paraphilic sexual activities. \\n Like many smaller spiders, the S’kakithi have substantially larger females than males, and the males, which are non-sapient, are frequently instinctively killed and consumed during or immediately after mating. To lessen the risk of this, the males tie the females up with their silk, and so in at least 70% of natural matings, the male survives. Because it is a part of the mating process, S’kakithi females find being bound highly pleasurable. To avoid depleting their own population of males, some S’kakithi engage in sexual activities with humans, and SCP-3629 refers to this interspecies cooperation. Humans, being approximately the size of a S’kakithi female and not biochemically similar to their prey or their males, are resistant to S’kakithi venom, and indeed experience euphoric hallucinations when injected with it. \\n To facilitate these encounters and meet proficient and interested humans, S’kakithi create profiles on dating applications, with an estimated 2100 profiles on Tinder and only about 150 distributed across OKCupid, Fetlife, and ChristianMingle. As the S’kakithi know that humans are not generally aware of their existence, these profiles do not explicitly identify the S’kakithi as such. \\n The humans involved in SCP-3629 are drawn primarily from the New York City bondage community. These individuals are informally vetted by both the S’kakithi and established members of this community, and are instructed in relevant information regarding the non-humanoid physiology of the S’kakithi. It is believed that 90 humans have taken part in SCP-3629. \\n SCP-3629 came to the Foundation’s attention in February 2018 as a result of Incident 3629-1, after S’kakithi investigators contacted the Foundation regarding a case they believed involved a human, in which S’kakithi had gone missing after participating in SCP-3629. Some relevant documents are reproduced below. \\n Interview 3629-3: To learn about SCP-3629 from a human perspective, on February 16, 2018, Agent Sebastian Allen interviewed Manny Li, whom the S’kakithi had identified as a regular participant in SCP-3629. He was not believed to be a suspect in the disappearances, nor was he believed to have any knowledge of the anomalous outside of the context of SCP-3629. Also present at the interview was Investigator Chisithrita, the S’kakithi liaison on the case. Note that as they are unable to vocalize English, S’kakithi communicate by text. \\n Agent Allen: Mr. Li, I’m glad you could make it. We’d like to ask you some questions about the Silkmaster community. \\n Manny Li: That’s… Uh, I’m sorry, officer, but I can’t talk about that. \\n Agent Allen: Are you worried about retaliation? My branch of NYPD liaisons with and addresses problems among New York City’s… less traditional inhabitants, including the S’kakithi. We have reason to believe a crime has been committed, and anything you can tell us will help. \\n Manny Li: Okay, so you know, but do they know you know? I’ve never heard of the Special Crimes Posting. Do they know about you guys? \\n Agent Allen: I believe I may be able to allay your concerns. \\n Allen leaves the room and returns with Investigator Chisithrita \\n Agent Allen: This is Chisithrita, our S’kakithi contact in this case. She can remain here while we talk to confirm that I don’t ask you about anything they’d rather us not hear about. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 😀😀😀Hi there Manny! 😀😀😀\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: I’m basically a spider cop🕵️\\u200d♀️🕷️\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: Sebastian and his people are good people, and they are helping us with our investigation. Explain to them the trysts you have with our people. \\n Manny Li: Well, as Chisithrita says, I— Look, how much do you already know about this? \\n Agent Allen: Only the basics, but we’d like to know more about the group and how you got into this. We’ve been in contact with them for a long time, but the S’kakithi tend to share information only when they think it’s relevant. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 😉We like our discretion. But tell them. \\n Manny Li: Okay. I’d been a part of the kink community for a while, both here and in Portland. Tom and Diane organize a lot of events for the local scene, and at one of these a year or so ago, Diane asked me to try a session with her where I tied her up according to some very specific and weird instructions and with something like a dozen tarantulas crawling on us. Screening, you see. \\n Agent Allen: Forgive me, Investigator, but Manny, I would think a lot of people have problems dealing with the S’kakithi? Tarantulas are quite a bit smaller. \\n Manny Li: Yeah, a few people drop out when they meet the S’kakithi, but by that point they’ve been sworn to secrecy. That’s actually the other way I was vetted. Tom told me something — false, as it turns out — but explosive and told me not to tell anyone about it. That I didn’t is why I had the spider scene with Diane. \\n Agent Allen: Sensible. So what happened after they decided to bring you in? \\n Manny Li: Well, first understand that the scenes I’ve been in are usually pretty tailored to an individual. But there’s still commonalities, patterns — how to tie someone so they can breathe and won’t have joint issues, establishing safewords, the sorts of materials and toys, how to end the session. That’s all different with the S’kakithi. Diane showed me the various binds on a volunteer, I think Irishis, as well as how to use webbing, and the safer ways to get a hit of venom from an aroused S’kakithi. Better for her, too, so she doesn’t sit around tied up too long. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Ooh, Irishis! She’s a bit 😘😘😘 \\n Agent Allen: Sorry, getting a hit of venom? How is that safe? \\n Manny Li: Safe enough, and absolutely worth it. That stuff is just beyond anything else. Yeah, a couple inches of fangs going into you has its risks. But they patch up the punctures as if they were never there. \\n Agent Allen: Investigator, you’re using your medicine on random civilians? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: I’m so sorry. Should we leave them riddled with holes? Or would you prefer we ate them? \\n Agent Allen: You know very well what we’d prefer… \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 😛 \\n Agent Allen: We can leave that. Manny, Mr. Li, tell me about how you arrange these encounters. \\n Manny Li: Tinder. \\n Agent Allen: Tinder? Public-facing Tinder, where anyone, totally unvetted, could talk with one of the S’kakithi? \\n Manny Li: I guess, but it’s not like they have real photos or say “Hey, I’m a giant spider”. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: We have our own laws.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: If they follow the Way of Chalt’tiri, we’ll follow the Tinder Terms of Service \\n Manny Li: There’s other cues, like the picture being some woman with a spider tattoo or with spiders crawling on her — some of these are from the scene; Diane appears a bunch — and these days they’ll usually say “Silkmaiden” somewhere on the profile. That’s I guess what’s become the name for this community, Silkmasters and Silkmaidens, though I guess you know about that. With us, we’ll sometimes say “Silkmaster”, but personally I found that attracted questions when I’m surfing for normal humans so I mostly use the chat to let them know that I’m on the inside. I do make clear I’m pretty into bondage though, which gets the S’kakithi to swipe right and avoids incompatible humans. \\n Agent Allen: I see. Are you usually able to find a match? \\n Manny Li: Always. This is really popular with the S’kakithi, so there’s tons of them for each of us. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: ☝️You stay on. We don’t.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: We stay satisfied. But you humans are so horny!😘\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: A whole species of Irishises \\n Manny Li: Okay, yes, that reduces the imbalance. Every S’kakithi I’ve met with drops off Tinder. I think they come back on eventually, but we’re talking like a year. \\n Agent Allen: Do you ever remain in touch with one of your dates to continue social relations? \\n Manny Li: No, that’s not what I’m on Tinder for. \\n Agent Allen: So these dates, where do they take place? \\n Manny Li: Their place, usually. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Sebastian, we take them no further underground than we take you. \\n Manny Li: Yeah, there’s elevators or fireman’s poles or something. They have these hidden trapdoors all over. I meet with the night’s partner at one of those, she grabs hold of me, then we fall, fall, fall. It’s not dark down there, but I don’t know what the lights are. Officer, it’s vast. \\n Agent Allen: Please continue. \\n Manny Li: Their homes, those I can understand. You’d expect giant webs, but they’re more like our houses, only in caves. Most of the appliances I recognized. I guess if you can use Tinder, you can use Amazon. I do the session with my date, and I’ll usually spend the night, since the venom takes a while to wear off. In the morning, she drops me off wherever I need to be. Handy for getting to work. \\n Agent Allen: Could you meet above ground if you wanted? \\n Manny Li: In some places. The first place I met one of the S’kakithi was in the studio, and I’ve done a scene or two there. I gather Leo has a tunnel into his basement. But my apartment would be completely impossible — I’m on the sixth floor, and the S’kakithi are pretty serious about their privacy. Diane makes sure we don’t do anything that might bring them down on us. We add her on social media, share our Tinder password, clear any photos related to the scene before putting them up. But it’s better than what the S’kakithi do — sorry, Investigator. That’s why I didn’t want to talk to you about this; I’ve heard of people who just shared photos vanishing. They said we couldn’t even tell our families. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: It can’t be allowed.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: They do live. We’re not monsters.👿 \\n Manny Li: Officer, you said there had been a crime. What is this about? \\n Agent Allen: Mr. Li, do you believe you could remove a S’kakithi from her home to the surface? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Not possible \\n Manny Li: I agree. Maybe if she was already pretty well-bound, I could move her, but up a vertical shaft? I don’t think I could make it back up myself, even if I did know the way. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: What about an ambush on being picked up or dropped off? \\n Manny Li: In most of my sessions, my date resists being tied up, but that’s playacting, half-fighting. I couldn’t subdue a truly uncooperative S’kakithi. Maybe with friends? Or weapons? But I’ve seen shed exoskeletal plates, and they’re really tough. Even with a gun, I don’t think I could stop her from at least getting back underground. Have S’kakithi been going missing? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Yes😠😢 \\n Agent Allen: Fine, we can tell him. So that leaves… Unless, Investigator, could they still be somewhere in your city? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: We would know.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: Assuming it is a human responsible, none of you could foil our methods. \\n Agent Allen: Let’s stick with that assumption for now. Mr. Li, it then seems that the only point of vulnerability would be during a session on the surface. Do you know of anyone who preferred to have their dates up here? \\n Manny Li: Maybe. As I said, a few people with ground level homes have passages in — Leo, Colleen, Muhammed, probably more — and I think Benjamin K is a claustrophobe, so he mostly meets at the studio. So yeah, him. But almost always we go under. Look, mood and atmosphere are really important for this kind of thing, and it’s just not the same here. \\n Agent Allen: I think I see. Have you noticed any unusual behavior by any of your friends lately? \\n Manny Li: Nothing unusual for them. \\n Agent Allen: I believe that’s everything, then. Investigator, do you have any further questions for Mr. Li? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 😁Thank you so much for helping, Manny!😁\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: Sebastian may want to interrogate you further at some later point.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: I may want to meet you again for other reasons.😉\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: If I’m not too forthright in asking, what’s your profile name?\\n\\nManny Li: On Tinder? Geez, okay. It’s “HungManny”. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: I’ll keep my eyes out!😁\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: 👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️ (🕷️) \\n Interview 3629-6: On February 27, 2018, IAC gave the Foundation access to Tinder chat logs for human participants in SCP-3629 and for the missing S’kakithi, in accordance with the plans from Interview 3629-5. Agent Sebastian Allen met with S’kakithi Investigators Chisithrita and Iskeran on March 1, 2018 to discuss the findings. \\n Agent Allen: Good morning, Investigator Iskeran, Investigator Chisithrita. Tinder finally turned over the logs. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Wonderful! 😃 Let’s take a look. \\n Investigator Iskeran: 🕷🔎 \\n Agent Allen: Right, I guess we’ll start off with the last to go missing. Let me know if you’re having trouble seeing the screen. Here’s the log for K’taithar. She met with SeventhWalrus — okay, I guess for the mustache — which seems to be the account of one Eric Thierse. \\n Investigator Iskeran: I’ve seen the name.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: But not one I’ve met. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: He looks strong. 💪 Could he be a web?\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: I mean, bait? \\n Investigator Iskeran: The name has been there for a long time. \\n Agent Allen: I don’t think so. He seems to have an account history, and I’d like to assume for now that our kidnapper isn’t able to edit Tinder’s files. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Liaisons with both our kinds. I don’t know this SeventhWalrus, but I do recall Aserak being quite satisfied. 🤪 So he’s real and just started grabbing ⛓his partners one day? Are any of his humans missing? \\n Agent Allen: I don’t know yet. We can look into that. Let’s go back to K’taithar’s last meeting. Is there anything odd about these messages? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Not that I can tell. He comes off well here. But every predator should be pleasing to her prey.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: They met at the studio rise. \\n Investigator Iskeran: That’s relevant. We wouldn’t travel from the Rise, so that must have been where K’taithar was seized.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: A definite 🔎. Was that where the other 🕷 were taken? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: Sebastian, let’s look at more. How about Espachia? \\n Agent Allen: Okay. Let’s see… Her last meeting wasn’t with Mr. Thierse. Espachia met with someone named Tietan. It says here her real name is — \\n Investigator Iskeran: 😲😲😲😰🤯 \\n Agent Allen: Uh, what is it, Investigator? \\n Investigator Iskeran: I MET WITH HER \\n Agent Allen: When? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: With one of their females? 🤢 Do you think it would be okay to start eating people as well as fucking them? \\n Investigator Iskeran: Humans don’t have true gender. They’re practically identical. Both 🚺 and 🚹 are ignorant of the Way of Chalt’tiri. I see no difference. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: They have the Tinder Terms of Service! If you got to know them, you’d see that. \\n Investigator Iskeran: Then wouldn’t their men you let bind you also be People? And you call me a pervert? \\n Agent Allen: Investigators! Please, I don’t understand this, but is it really relevant? Iskeran, Investigator Iskeran, you said you met with Ms. Willard-Neeson, Tietan. Was this for, uh, SCP-3629? When was this? \\n Investigator Iskeran: Yes. And my fellow Investigator will find nothing in Chalt’tiri to condemn that.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: I met with her four days ago. \\n Agent Allen: That’s well after Espachia vanished. Did she seem uncomfortable or anything like that? Any indicator of anything wrong, any aggressive moves against you at the surface? \\n Investigator Iskeran: I don’t know how to tell if she was uncomfortable, but she was quite satisfying. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: How did she talk to Espachia? \\n Agent Allen: I’ll bring that up. Oh, again meeting at the studio. That’s definitely a theme. \\n Investigator Iskeran: We met at a Rise near her 🏠. \\n Agent Allen: Are all of these meetings at the studio? Mind if I scroll through? \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 🤔Go right ahead. \\n Agent Allen: Ikla’akti disappeared after meeting RebelStar929… at the studio. Sichariti disappeared after meeting LionManWaistDown… at the studio. Chik— \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 🔎Is LionManWaistDown named Leo?🔎 \\n Agent Allen: Leonel Simcoe, yes. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: We built a rise to Leo’s house. He is in touch with the ground. There’s no reason he’d ask to meet at the studio. \\n Agent Allen: That seems to be where all the abductions have happened. We can search the place, but perhaps there’s something there necessary for subduing the victims. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 🕵️\\u200d♀️I don’t think so. Sebastian, Investigator Iskeran, might Leo and these others be imitated? \\n Investigator Iskeran: A deception? It shouldn’t be. Agent Allen, go back to the conversation between Espachia and Tietan. \\n Agent Allen: Sure. \\n Investigator Iskeran: Does not this remind you of SeventhWalrus’s approach?\\nInvestigator Iskeran: This was not how Tietan spoke to me.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: 🕸🕷👿🕸 \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 🧠Oh, good thinking, Investigator! 🧠 Show your conversation with Tietan to us.😉 \\n Agent Allen: We have experts on writing styles. I’m not one myself, but I can contact one. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: You are a human. If Iskeran thought she saw a difference, you’re sure to. \\n Investigator Iskeran: My personal correspondences are not supposed to be a part of the case!\\nInvestigator Iskeran: But I can show Agent Allen. \\n Agent Allen: Okay, yes, that’s definitely different than the Espachia conversation. Unless she forgot how to capitalize letters between talking to Espachia and to you. Okay, I think that’s a good working hypothesis. Somehow, someone is getting onto the Tinder accounts of humans involved with 3629 and setting up meetings with S’kakithi at the studio, where… what? We got stuck here when Manny was here too, Chisithrita. Shouldn’t the victim realize that it’s not her date there and bolt back underground? \\n Investigator Iskeran: No.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: You look the same. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 🤫\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: More diplomatically, you look human.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: When you’re together, I can tell you apart — you have different clothes, skin, hair, size — but alone, it’s harder. Especially since you change your appearance so much! \\n Investigator Iskeran: She may have let herself be bound by someone else. \\n Agent Allen: And then unable to free herself when they showed their true colors. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 😥We have stories like that. Some are romantic ❤️ when the hero finds her binder is a shimmering drone with thick silk instead of the shedding old lurker who’d been around her nest. But in real life? By a human? 🤢💔💔💔 \\n Agent Allen: So we want someone with access to the studio, a way to hack people’s accounts, and some reason for doing this. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 😳😳I think I know who.\\nInvestigator Chisithrita: HungManny said that out of fear of our displeasure over our seclusion being spoiled, he and his fellow Silkmasters let BoundToPlease — Diane — audit their Tinder accounts. And of course she has access to the studio. \\n Agent Allen: Yes! I think we had best bring her in for questioning. And her husband Tom too; if she is behind this, he might be as well. The two of them probably know more about you all than anyone outside the Foundation. \\n Investigator Iskeran: Or the Global Occult Coalition.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: Or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\\nInvestigator Iskeran: Or the Leaves of Winter. \\n Investigator Chisithrita: 🤫 Now then, Investigator, let’s leave some secrets for Sebastian to discover on his own.😉 \\n Addendum 3629-6: Following the conclusions of Interview 3629-6, Foundation operatives apprehended Diane and Thomas Mallory. Under interrogation, they confessed to abducting and imprisoning six S’kakithi over a period of three months. Thomas explained that they harvested the venom from their victims and sold it as a drug. As S’kakithi venom is not anomalous and the Mallorys did not share the origin of the substance, no followup on the buyers is necessary. The victims were rescued from a property owned by the couple, dehydrated but alive. At the insistence of the S’kakithi Principality, Thomas and Diane were remanded to their custody. \\n Addendum 3629-7: Below are reproduced several Tinder profiles of S’kakithi participating in SCP-3629. \\n 📍 less than a mile away \\n You: Strong 💪 Silkmaster (men ONLY!)\\nSend pics of your knots ➰ \\n Me: Silkmaiden 🕸️💞🕸️ My kiss 😘 will have you seeing stars! \\n 📍 less than a mile away \\n Silk… Well, \"maiden\" would be quite inaccurate 😘\\nI know what I want and I want a lot…\\nNot from Ireland!! \\n 📍 less than a mile away \\n i\\'m a giant spider woman w/ nice eyes looking for a strong human to tie me up\\nmust like getting bit \\n OMG why are so many creeps messaging me??!?\\ni\\'m closing my account \\n « SCP-3628 | SCP-3629 | SCP-3630 » \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"SCP-3629\" by Anaxagoras, from the SCP Wiki.

SCP-3684-1 instances are similarly contained to a maximum limit of twenty, after which additional instances may be destroyed. Lead produced by SCP-3684 is non-anomalous, and may be destroyed or repurposed at the discretion of either the Site Director or current project lead for SCP-3684. \\n Any person or entity identified as SCP-3684-A is to be given full care as required, with Midwifery specialists on hand until such a time as anomalous effects cease. \\n Description: SCP-3684 is a sex doll made in the image of a stereotypical western cowboy. SCP-3684 is entirely inanimate until an individual (designated SCP-3684-A) approaches it and expresses a desire to engage in sexual intercourse. At this point, SCP-3684 will animate itself and engage in intercourse with SCP-3684-A. SCP-3684 seems to have an innate understanding of SCP-3684-A\\'s sexual desires, and will alter its behavior to match its current partner(s). \\n SCP-3684\\'s primary anomaly is activated when it nears the end of sexual intercourse.1 At this point, it will vocalize the phrase \"I\\'m going to pump you full of lead.\" Immediately following this vocalization, SCP-3684 will ejaculate up to three liters of molten lead either inside or onto SCP-3684-A. This lead is incapable of harming SCP-3684-A until it comes out of contact with SCP-3684-A for at least five minutes, at which point it will solidify and cool to roughly 40 degrees Celsius. The source of this lead is unknown, and SCP-3684 appears to be able to produce an unlimited amount from within itself. \\n The lead produced by SCP-3684 also functions identically to semen, and is capable of impregnating SCP-3684\\'s partners. Pregnancy in females will function as normal, however at a much-accelerated rate.2 SCP-3684-1 refers to any offspring born between SCP-3684 and an SCP-3684-A individual. These offspring will mature rapidly, growing to their full size after roughly five weeks. SCP-3684-1 are virtually identical to SCP-3684, though they are only about 70% its size and are made of various combinations of ceramics and flesh. \\n Male SCP-3684-A instances are also capable of being impregnated by SCP-3684\\'s effect. How this is accomplished is unknown, but due to the location of the unborn SCP-3684-1 instance male pregnancies do not last. The unborn SCP-3684-1 instances are most commonly excreted after 3-4 days. To date, the longest male pregnancy lasted 8 days. \\n All SCP-3684-1 instances share SCP-3684\\'s anomalous properties, with minor differences. SCP-3684-1 instances are incapable of being impregnated, with female instances splitting into two SCP-3684-1 instances after being used. Additionally, when any SCP-3684-1 instance engages in intercourse, all other instances will become animated and attempt to travel to the approximate location of said intercourse. Once they reach the aforementioned location they will request to participate in the ongoing intercourse. In the event that permission to participate is denied, the SCP-3684-1 instance will immediately dissolve into between 300 and 400 liters of molten lead, which will hurl itself towards the primary SCP-3684-1 instance and will be ejaculated at the end of intercourse. Where this lead is generated from is unknown. \\n « SCP-3683 | SCP-3684 | SCP-3685 »\"', 'SCP-3726': '\"This page doesn\\'t exist. \\n This page may have been moved or deleted, or it may have never existed.

MTF Ξ-9110 (\"Armed Nuns\") are to be dispatched to neutralize these instances as they appear. Lethal force has been authorized for contact with hostile entities under its influence. All allocated resources are to be focused on the implementation of Protocol RHINEHARDT. \\n Recent estimations project an immense loss of life should SCP-3918 surpass all contingencies and reach Earth. Should SCP-3918 breach the perimeter established by ELIOS, threat-level MOJAVE BLACK is to be declared, and the use of all necessary deterrents will be authorized. Currently, SCP-3918 is 768,800\\xa0km away from the nearest ELIOS installation and will make contact in █ days and ██ hours. \\n Description: SCP-3918 is the designation for a Class-X Reality Restructuring Entity currently traveling through deep space. At its current speed and trajectory, SCP-3918 will encounter the Earth on ██████ ██, ████. Through satellite imagery, it has been observed to possess the form of a human female, albeit lacking any facial features or upper limbs. Various thaumaturgic symbols are carved into its surface, although the significance of this has yet to be determined. It has been measured to be 38,300km in height. \\n Prior to its current designation, SCP-3918 was originally believed to be an anomalous structure that impacted the Earth\\'s surface on April 13th, 2020 (It has since been designated as SCP-3918-1.) SCP-3918-1 is an oblong object comprised of a crystallized material approximately 8\\xa0m in height. Various signs consistent with those found on SCP-3918 mark its outside surface. \\n Initial investigations of SCP-3918-1 were prevented by the aerosolization of undetected compounds which caused anomalous and contagious hypersexuality in members of the kingdom Animalia. The resulting high volume of sexual activity in the research team initiated an event in which SCP-3918-1 proceeded to rapidly generate pockets of reality consistent with lunar terrain and accompanying vacuums in the area, now designated as Area-0219. Scranton Reality Anchor Array #12 was then deployed to Area-0219 and was activated, preventing the continuation of the event. Following this, no other instance of SCP-3918-1 has made contact with Earth. \\n Approximately four hours after the successful deterrence of SCP-3918-1, Foundation Deep-Space Defense Network ELIOS registered a field of temporal distortion roughly 3.5 light years away from Earth. Shortly after its discovery, hume levels surrounding the distortion dropped dramatically, leading to a destabilization of reality in the area. SCP-3918 then emerged from the distortion shortly before its instantaneous collapse and began its course to Earth. \\n  \\n  \\n \"Approach thy Moon, for SHE is the shepherd of the feeble, SHE is the healer of the sick, and SHE is the banisher of the wicked. SUBMIT to HER grace, and allow HIS completion to guide you to THEIR promised salvation. It is the only way.\" \\n -Chapter XVI of the Sacred Texts \\n As of Overseer Mandate E001.421, RAISA has been granted approval for the complete suppression of evidence of the existence of GoI-3918: \"The Church of the Starved Goddess.\" The means of doing so have been left to the Administration\\'s discretion. In addition, Overseer Mandate E001.421 has authorized the development of E-Class \"LAST RESORT\" countermeasures to the threat imposed by SCP-3918 and its following. The implications of such developments have been accepted by the Overseer Council with 7 voting in favor, 5 voting in opposition, and 1 abstaining. \\n Current information suggests that GoI-3918 is a loosely-organized monotheistic cult estimated to possess a following of approximately 15,000 individuals. Its main objective is to prepare Earth for what it refers to as \"The Day of Eternal Pleasure,\" in which Earth is terraformed by SCP-3918 into a state resembling the Moon, through the use of thaumaturgic energy generated by a species-wide collective sexual act. Following this \"rebirth,\" the now-barren Earth is to be utilized in SCP-3918\\'s construction of \"Him,\" a separate entity whose purpose is to satisfy its desires. Translation of the church\\'s sacred texts has confirmed the date of this occurrence to be April 13th, 2020. \\n Further investigation into the Church of the Starved Goddess has resulted in the discovery of Uri\\'Arkana, a temple initially believed to be of a different origin. Several anomalous artifacts recovered from within the temple suggest that the Church has been in existence as early as 250\\xa0A.D, although no records stating its existence have been found within the surrounding cultures. Written records discovered in the temple\\'s archives contain several references to SCP-3918 under the name \"Anukeana.\" The Department of Linguistics has produced a translation of a section from these texts. (See Document-3918-A12.) \\n Document 3918-A12 is a section derived from a large series of texts pertaining to the supposed history of SCP-3918. In its entirety, it spans 24 \"Chapters\" spread over three consecutive tomes known as the Sacred Texts. This specific section is derived from Chapter VI. \\n In the Second Rising, it was Anukeana who protested Segrasi.2 \\n \"He is the darkness.\" She would sing. \"The darkness must be outshone by the light.\" \\n And so, the Goddess conducted her work. In the early hours of the night, she crept into his chambers and laid with him. She coaxed the sin from his veins and purged it in the explosion of her own satisfaction. He was born anew into the dawn, a disciple of her Highness. She had destined him to be her voice in the East, and he was cast out to spread her word. \\n Her Highness was restless and without fullness. A fire burned within her heart and loins, the offerings of even sub-divine men being without complete satisfaction. She yearned for something of her own status, another God, another part of her that could outlast the puny lives of those who she accepted in her chambers. Her greatness was limitless, but even it could not offer her an end to her predicament. \\n The followers had offered their voices to her ear. Isolated, they were useless and without guidance. Collected, they could surpass even the false gods of the West. They beseeched their true goddess to unify them, to make them whole, to bring them into her breast and create what she desired most. The ultimate sacrifice was a solid commitment to their deity, and they accepted it without hesitation. She smiled upon them and granted them their wish. \\n He was to be constructed from the Universe, although she hesitated in choosing to do so. The Universe was no longer new. She considered it to be shameful in its disregard for pleasure. If she were to bring about the embodiment of her desire, she was to clean the sin from the materials that would build him: The fiery stars and the planets tainted with sickness that would poison him… \\n And so, the Goddess set out on her holy voyage, a mass exodus of evil and darkness, granting her grace upon those who were willing to convert without struggle… \\n In the days proceeding the events surrounding SCP-3918-1, the Church of the Starved Goddess conducted several offenses on the Foundation, utilizing a combination of highly-advanced weaponry and thaumaturgic artifacts. To date, there have been seven recorded instances of terrorism conducted at the hands of the Church against both Foundation sites and civilian cities. Previous occurrences of similar natures are currently being investigated for connections to GoI-3918. \\n « SCP-3917 | SCP-3918 | SCP-3919 »\"', 'SCP-3929': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-3929 \\n scp-3929 - boner pill by dado \\n ▸ More by this Author ◂ \\n  \\n   \\n F.A.Q. \\n SCP-3929. \\n Item #: SCP-3929 \\n Object Class: Safe \\n Special Containment Procedures: The entire known supply of SCP-3929 is contained in a secure container at Site-81. Testing of SCP-3929 cannot take place without the authorization of the current SCP-3929 research head, currently Dr. G. McElroy, the Site-81 Containment Research Head. \\n Description: SCP-3929 is the group designation for a supply of roughly one-hundred twenty seven dark umber pharmaceutical capsules believed to have been produced by notable paraphamacologist and current Person of Interest \"dado\". The pills are bottled in standard orange prescription containers with white lids, and each has a sticker on the exterior with the words \"boner pill by dado\" written on it. \\n The effects of the drug become apparent roughly twenty minutes after ingestion. Subjects will begin to experience minor irritation, followed immediately by symptoms of rapid aging. Over the course of the next four hours, subjects will experience joint stiffness, poor posture, slowed and limited movement, decrease in overall energy, constipation, incontinence, slowing of mental processes, reduced reflexes, decrease in visual acuity, severely diminished hearing, wrinkling and sagging skin, and whitening or graying of hair. In most cases, the presumed age of the subject increases by at least seventy-years1. The subject\\'s presumed age generally decreases as the effect of the medication wears off, unless the subject expires due to age-related causes. \\n At the same time, subjects will also report massively increased libido, past what is considered normal in humans. These effects are directly related; as subjects appear to grow older, their sex drive increases dramatically. This increase in sexual desire, combined with the various detriments that come with extremely advanced age, leads many individuals to become increasingly irritable. Notably, the medication does not appear to help with any sort of sexual dysfunction, much to the chagrin of affected subjects. \\n Addendum 3929.1: Discovery \\n SCP-3929 was discovered after the arrest of several individuals near Boca Raton, Florida by local police. The arrest was part of a much larger investigation into a rash of drug-related offenses involving seniors. After the effects of the medication became apparent, Foundation officials intercepted the drugs and began a series of raids on local drug manufacturers, with the hope of exposing the individual called \"dado\". \\n While this was eventually unsuccessful, Foundation agents did collect a laptop containing a number of emails between one of the arrested individuals and dado. During questioning, the individual claimed to have never met dado personally, having only interacted with them over the internet. The contents of the emails are below. \\n Date: 05/19/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey2 \\n demario said to hit you up. says you got the good shit. you make stuff? \\n Date: 05/20/2017\\nFrom: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey\\nTo: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue \\n yes i am dado hello. \\n Date: 05/20/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n you trying to play right now? we don\\'t fuck around man. i want to know if you can provide some shit. yes or no \\n Date: 05/21/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n wtf dude you there? hello? \\n Date: 05/22/2017\\nFrom: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey\\nTo: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue \\n yes sry dado type slow. but i make 4 u. what u want? \\n Date: 05/22/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n ok. you know viagra right? little blue pill that makes old people horny. we need a lot of that. i dont care if it works perfectly, we just need it cheap. got it? \\n Date: 05/23/2017\\nFrom: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey\\nTo: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue \\n ok u want pill what make old and horny yes? \\n Date: 05/23/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n yes but we dont care if its exactly right. you get it? this is a scam. we just want cheap. \\n Date: 05/24/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n hello???!!! \\n Date: 05/25/2017\\nFrom: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey\\nTo: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue \\n ok i make 4 u. i ship 2 u in one week. no charge. i have amazon prime \\n Date: 06/02/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n hey man what the fuck is this shit you sent us. why these pills brown? this doesnt look like viagra dude the bottle says boner pills. wtf i want my money back \\n Date: 06/03/2017\\nFrom: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey\\nTo: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue \\n no it ok. these better than vagro. u trust dado. \\n Date: 06/06/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n god damn it you asshole what did you do. holy shit my skin is getting so wrinkled and my balls are down by my knees goddamn. more important tho rn is that i want you to come on down here and plop that round little white ass of yours down on this dick \\n Date: 06/06/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n wtf it only gets worse?!?! \\n Date: 06/06/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n you there \\n Date: 06/06/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n you want 2 fuck? \\n Date: 06/06/2017\\nFrom: zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue#zib.ekansd|eafwlahfue\\nTo: moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey#moc.liamtoh|odadmaisey \\n hevens to betsy i just want to nut \\n Addendum 3929.2: Testing Log \\n 3929 Trial #1 \\n Subject: D-92014 (34 year old adult male) \\n Dosage: 1 capsule \\n Result: Subject aged rapidly over the course of roughly four hours, reaching a maximum age of approximately 140 years before the effect of the medication wore off. Subject returned to normal afterwards. \\n Subject Feedback: Subject began aggressively rubbing his genitalia against a chair after three hours. \\n 3929 Trial #6 \\n Subject: D-92234 (46 year old adult female) \\n Dosage: 1 capsule \\n Result: Same as above - subject aged rapidly over the span of four hours. Subject reached a maximum presumed age of 160 years. Subject returned to normal afterwards. Subject had to be restrained on three occasions, as the subject attempted to aggressively insert their fist into their vagina. \\n Subject Feedback: Subject noted as having asked \"just push your whole leg up in there whippersnapper\" on no fewer than six different occasions. \\n 3929 Trial #14 \\n Subject: D-92651 (20 year old adult female3) \\n Dosage: 1 capsule \\n Result: Subject began to rapidly decrease in age over the course of four hours. Subject reached a presumed age of two weeks. Subject returned to normal afterwards. \\n Subject Feedback: Throughout the entire trial, the subject began to speak increasingly enthusiastically about flying kites, starting initially with their love of flying kites with their father and leading eventually to, just before they lost the ability to speak altogether, their $50,000 \"aero-rig\" equipped with advanced instrumentation and constructed from extremely high-quality materials. At several points, the subject referred to it as \"the kite life\" and rebuked a researcher for describing it as a hobby.4 \\n 3929 Trial #43 \\n Subject: D-93489 (52 year old adult female) \\n Dosage: 2 capsules \\n Result: Subject ingested both capsules and, after roughly five minutes, spontaneously burst into a pile of ash. While the subject did not recover from this incident, several individuals attending to the remains noted that the pile of ash made them feel incredibly sexually uncomfortable. \\n « SCP-3928 | SCP-3929 | SCP-3930 »\"', 'SCP-4106': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-4106 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n By Marcelles D.

There is no character limit for the message, and no upper limit to the amount of currency an individual is allowed to donate, although the model receiving the donation has the ability to deny it. Should this occur, the individual will be refunded. \\n UPDATE 9/20/2021\\nFollowing the incident involving the model \"LonelyGirl15\" and the user \"ifuckmonsters\", SCP-4106 has developed a method to detect the species of individuals attempting to access it. This new anomalous property is being used to prevent humans from creating new accounts with SCP-4106.

Entity is adorned with a blue sweater and black basketball shorts. Entity contorts the bones in its mouth area in a manner that would suggest smiling, despite lacking lips or the facial muscle to do so.\\nInteraction: Entity proclaims that Doctor Shorey is \"going to have a bad time\" before proceeding to strip in a suggestive manner. The bioluminescent eye increases its luminosity exponentially before several bone-like protrusions extend from the edges of the screen, obscuring the entity\\'s presence. When the bones retract, the entity appears to \"wink\" at Doctor Shorey before exiting the frame. \\n Assigned personnel: Doctors Light, Brown, and Corbett\\nTip amount: $20.00\\nEntity description: Entity is comprised of musical notes which, while imperceptible on screen recordings, are visible with the naked eye. All three subjects regard the entity as the most physically attractive organism they\\'ve ever seen.\\nInteraction: Entity proceeded to \"dance\" on screen for several minutes. The doctors appear to find the entity\\'s movements enjoyable, and once the routine is completed, the entity begins a second routine. The entity\\'s movements and pitch alter drastically, causing visible confusion in the doctors, who then begin physical altercations with one another. This activity lasts until security removes them four hours later3. \\n Assigned personnel: D-17802\\nTip amount: $10.00\\nEntity description: Insectoid entity with several tendrils extending from its carapace with an estimated average length of 30 centimeters. Entity possesses elongated eyestalks that it often uses to type various symbols into a holographic keyboard-like apparatus.\\nInteraction: Entity squeals for several minutes before stroking its eyestalks with its tendrils. The entity presses several of the inputs on the apparatus, generating a memetic hazard that scrolls vertically across the screen. D-17802 appears to feel overwhelming pleasure throughout her body judging by a series of short convulsions appearing to originate in the groin area before expiring from cardiac arrest. Entity shrieks for several seconds before removing portions of its carapace, revealing a transparent, undulating sack with an unknown blue substance contained within. D-17802\\'s face can be seen floating within the sack. \\n Assigned personnel: D-15807\\nTip amount: $10.00\\nEntity description: Entity is a hexapedal canid adorned with iridescent lingerie that alters colors based on its position. Entity has seven eyes, four of which are missing, on what would be considered the head in non-anomalous canids of similar height. Entity has several lacerations on its body from which an unknown pink substance leaks. Present slightly out of frame is a humanoid entity holding a serrated knife.\\nInteraction: The humanoid entity approaches the camera before shouting expletives. Upon closer inspection, the humanoid entity can be identified as male. Several lacerations are present on its torso and forearms, while multiple oral indentation wounds are present on its face and neck. The humanoid entity does not appear to be wearing pants. The humanoid frequently glances to the canid entity as it attempts to commence egress. It raises the serrated knife into the camera frame and discards it. The humanoid entity embraces the canid entity and begins crying. This continues for twenty minutes before the humanoid entity returns to the camera and deactivates it.\"', 'SCP-4174': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-4174 \\n SCP-4174 - Mother of Many\\nIdeas Thread: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-12841011/mother-of-many\\nDraft Thread: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-12848601/mother-of-many \\n [{$authorPage} ▸ More by this Author ◂] \\n  \\n   \\n F.A.Q. \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4174 is to be held in a containment cell capable of housing 10 humanoids. Because of SCP-4174\\'s self-sustaining capabilities, regular interaction is not required. If the number of SCP-4174-A instances exceeds 10, the third oldest instance is to be terminated. The oldest and second oldest instances are to be kept alive for potential future experimentation concerning the effects of aging. At least one member of Level 3 Security staff must be present during any and all experimentation on SCP-4174 in order to prevent disruption by instances of SCP-4174-A. \\n Description: SCP-4174 is the corpse of an obese 89 year old woman perpetually in livor mortis.1 SCP-4174 will spontaneously generate a fertilized egg in its womb, which will go through a normal birth cycle, from gestation to birth, within a nine month period. Immediately after giving birth, SCP-4174 will produce another fertilized egg,2 which will develop and be born in nine months, repeating the cycle. \\n SCP-4174-A are the entities born from SCP-4174; as of February 10th, 2019, there are currently four instances of SCP-4174-A. SCP-4174-A are humanoids which constantly excrete light amounts of blood and pus similar to that found on newborn infants. SCP-4174-A remain connected to SCP-4174 through their umbilical cord. If this umbilical cord is severed, SCP-4174-A will enter a highly panicked state in which they will run to SCP-4174 and start crying profusely, often shaking SCP-4174 or screaming incoherently at it, before expiring due to the onset of stress-induced cardiac arrest. \\n SCP-4174-A instances maintain an intelligence level comparable to that of a three year old child, and will often react to staff by crying,3 screaming, and attempting to flee. In situations in which SCP-4174-A flee, they will attempt to carry SCP-4174 and bring it with them. Even when working together, they typically lack the strength to carry SCP-4174. \\n The current oldest SCP-4174-A instance is believed to be roughly 20 years old. 14 loose umbilical cords appear to have been severed prior to containment4 with an additional three severed during experimentation. Along with continuing to produce SCP-4174-A instances, the breasts of SCP-4174 will lactate profuse amounts of human breast milk, which the instances will drink as their only required form of sustenance. Each instance of SCP-4174-A has been seen drinking roughly four liters of breast milk from SCP-4174 a day. \\n Discovery: SCP-4174 was discovered on January 17th, 2019, in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, after several reports of \"unsettling moaning\" coming from a home in the Brooklyn Homes district, originating from [REDACTED], home to the Totenmich family. Upon police investigation, SCP-4174 was discovered in the basement. Foundation Intelligence Agents embedded in Baltimore Police reported this to the Foundation and all police officers were amnesticized. The family was not amnesticized until after initial interviews. SCP-4174 has been confirmed to be Audrey Totenmich, who was the oldest member of the family living in the household. \\n Interview Log 4174/WEISS-1: The following interview was conducted by Junior Researcher Luna Weiss with Leonard Totenmich, the eldest son of Audrey Totenmich, as part of routine background information investigation. \\n Luna: Alright, let\\'s start at the beginning: how long have you known of Audrey Totenmich in her current form? \\n Leonard: Uh, well, it was pretty sudden, way back in, 2001 I think? Early 2001. I just want to double check, I\\'m not gonna be arrested for this? \\n Luna: Not if you cooperate. Do you know of the possible circumstances leading up to her assuming this form? \\n Leonard: Well, it just sort of… happened. One day she got pregnant out of nowhere, everyone was bickering over how she could be pregnant since, well, she\\'s 89, but also who the father was. When the time came around she gave birth, the docs cut the cord, and it cried so much… I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever get those cries out of my head… the baby went limp after, dead after only a few minutes. Doc said it was rare but does happen so we didn\\'t think too much about the death at the time. \\n Luna: How many times did this phenomenon happen before her passing? \\n Leonard: Three times. On the fourth, she didn\\'t make it, but the baby did. We didn\\'t go to the hospital this time, we figured something was off and we don\\'t want to have her reputation be smeared as a skank. We cut the cord again and the baby died, but then she… kept going, she kept giving birth, every nine months, over and over. You don\\'t know stress till you\\'re helping a corpse give birth so you can kill the baby right after. After a while, we decided to just stop cutting the cord and hope that would keep them alive. It did, but, well, they weren\\'t really people. \\n Luna: So you decided to keep her in the basement? \\n Leonard: We didn\\'t know what to do, we couldn\\'t show this to someone or we\\'d get the FBI up in our bonnets, no offense, and the kids seemed to live fine without any of us helping, so we just… let it be. Kept it as a dark family secret. Never invite anyone over in case they hear it or wander into it. \\n Luna: Understood. Thank you for your cooperation, we will have an agent come in momentarily to help you remember more details. \\n Subsequent interviews with the five children and 14 grandchildren of Audrey Totenmich whom could be contacted revealed little additional information. \\n Investigation 4174/POI01: Investigation into Audrey Totenmich\\'s social media from when she was alive has shown numerous posts shaming individuals who live promiscuous lifestyles, referring to them as \"Sluts\", \"Skanks\", \"Whores\", etc. Many of these posts are directed at Lily Totenmich, a granddaughter of Audrey Totenmich. Investigation of Lily\\'s social media shows that she led a sexually active lifestyle, regularly discussing sex and sexual partners. Prior to the currently believed date of creation of SCP-4174 (\"Early 2001\"), Audrey Totenmich made the following post: \\n ok i am fucking done ive had it with lily we all know what a fucking god disgracing whore she is sleeping with a new man and dykes every day but this crosses the line. lily had the gall to blame me for her getting fired at her last few jobs and for losing her bf (god only knows which one). its not my fault shes a disgusting slut that brings shame to her otherwise good christian family, all i did was let them know this so they know the kind of sinner there putting themselves near. lily is not invited to christmas or new years this year, we dont want the stench of 50 men and 10 dykes pussy juice making a mockery of the birth of christ. i am disowning her and everyone who sees this you should too there is no good reason for her to be living this lifestyle let alone get mad when she gets called out for it \\n All attempts to contact Lily Totenmich have failed. Intelligence Agents visited her home near The Block,5 after no response the agents entered the building to find numerous Thaumaturgic Runes, trace amounts of sulfur, fire damage to objects around the Thaumaturgic Runes, and abundant amounts of human semen, lubricant, and other miscellaneous sexual fluids. DNA from the sexual fluids match that of the mother for all SCP-4174-A instances. Lily Totenmich has been officially labeled PoI-4174/01 and marked for further investigation. \\n Interview Log 4174/POI01/WEISS-1: The following interview was conducted by Junior Researcher Luna Weiss with Richard Boreman, the last known romantic or sexual partner of PoI-4174/01 according to her social media profile. \\n Richard: Didn\\'t know the FBI was cracking down on prostitution so hard. \\n Luna: A lot of people don\\'t know a lot of things. When did you first meet Lily? \\n Richard: First met? Probably like, back in 2000, but we were only acquaintances, friend of a friend you know? We didn\\'t really start to, uh, \"get to know each other\" until a few years ago. \\n Luna: When and where did you last see Lily? \\n Richard: Down at The Block, like eight months ago, the only lady who never charged anyone. We had way too much fun those days. I had to stop though, part \\'cause I was feeling really tired and out of it all the time,6 part cause I had a harder time actually finding her. \\n Luna: Do you know of possible methods of finding Lily? \\n Richard: Nah, she went dark, last thing I heard from her was something about a group she joined? Don\\'t know what kind of deal could\\'ve made her need to disappear but it is what it is I guess. \\n Luna: Did you notice any differences between her when you first met her in 2000 and recently? \\n Richard: Oh god yeah, she got a lot hotter, a lot hornier, and a lot more active. Had way more sex all the time and always got super into it. Just between you and me, honestly made it a little hard to concentrate when she was around, she was that damn good. \\n Luna: Are you familiar at all with Lily\\'s grandmother, Audrey Totenmich? \\n Richard: Wish I wasn\\'t, you know how women can be after sex, always talking about their problems and shit, and every time it was some nonsense about her granny, getting real sad. Said stuff like \"She was awful but she doesn\\'t deserve this, I\\'m only making her problem worse,\" stuff like that. She was always eager to go again after it though so whatever. \\n Luna: You mentioned a group earlier, could you elaborate? \\n Richard: Not really, I think she called it a syndicate but didn\\'t give a name, only talked about it once and I was only half listening. I just remember it was really weird. \\n Luna: Understood, thank you for your cooperation. Another agent will be with you briefly for routine documentation. \\n Further interviews with previous romantic and sexual partners of PoI-4174/01 reveal little additional information. The current estimate of individuals who have had sexual relationships with PoI-4174/01 prior to her disappearance and after the suspected anomaly creation date (\"Early 2001\") exceeds 1,000 people, primarily in Maryland and bordering states. Each instance of SCP-4174-A matched in DNA to the earliest known individuals, with each subsequent SCP-4174-A following this list of men in chronological order. It is believed that there will be one SCP-4174-A instance for every male, one born every nine months, and thus SCP-4174 will continue to give birth for an estimated 735 years or longer if PoI-4174/01 continues. \\n Incident Report 4174/POI01/01: Attempts were made using the sulfur from PoI-4174/01\\'s home to contact a suspected Tartarean entity. Upon beginning of the ritual, all current instances of SCP-4174-A began screaming at 120\\xa0dB and attempted to move themselves and SCP-4174 to the corner of its room furthest away from where the ritual was carried out. Ultimately the ritual failed as the Tartarean entity could not be summoned.7 Following this, SCP-4174-A instances became noticeably more distressed in the presence of staff who participated in the ritual. Rather than fleeing from these staff members as expected, SCP-4174-A lie on the floor in a fetal position, shaking violently, in addition to crying and screaming. \\n Addendum 4174/POI01/01: After an estimated 12 failed attempts at tracking PoI-4174/01, Foundation Intelligence Agents imbedded in the social media and tech industry uncovered a heavily corrupted, discarded chatlog between \"LilyFlowerBloom\" (believed to be PoI-4174/01) and \"NeedMoreForma\" (now categorized as PoI-4174/02). The chat contained numerous cognitohazards, including an antimemetic effect causing the reader to dismiss the chat log as sexual in nature, a cognitohazard on all messages sent by \"NeedMoreForma\" increasing susceptibility of the reader, and a cognitohazard on all messages sent by \"LilyFlowerBloom\" causing the reader to experience heightened levels of sexual desire. This document has been cleaned of cognitohazards and pieced together to the best of Foundation File Recovery ability, and can be read below. \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nLily, we need to talk. \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\nAww, does daddy need some loving~? \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nWe found your deal maker. \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\n? \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nThe guy you made a deal with back in 2001, remember you were talking to me and some of the other guys about how you wanted to get back at the guy? \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\nWAIT REALLY??? \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nBelieve so, if you want to come get him he\\'s here for you at [COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED]8 \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\nOMG TY TY TY!!!!! \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nHey, it doesn\\'t matter a whole lot to me, just curious, what exactly do you plan on doing to him? \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\nGetting revenge. He lied to me about the deal, said my family would love me again, prove grandma wrong, that it would bring Ryan back, but all it did was steal my soul and made me cum hungry all the time. I want him to go through the absolute misery he put me through, and what he put grandma through. \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nWeren\\'t you already cum hungry all the time? :P \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\nLittle bit lol \\n NeedMoreForma 05/28/18\\nWill you need the alienator? \\n LilyFlowerBloom 05/28/18\\nAnd much more, I\\'ll start moving out tomorrow.

Educational films mentioning damselflies are to include a segment during which the viewer is to be advised to not disturb damselflies during mating. \\n Description: SCP-4203 is a mating ritual observed in the Pyrrhosoma nymphula subspecies of damselfly. The end product of this ritual is the creation of a Type-II localized wormhole to an extra-dimensional space. \\n To initiate SCP-4203, the male instance performs a courtship dance by hovering in front of the female and displaying its wings and abdomen. The instances then mate by conjoining in a \"heart\" formation, often while flying in tandem. \\n The female will then attempt to locate a protected area to continue mating (usually a small tree branch or rock). Once identifying a suitable location, the female will grasp onto a nearby object with its legs while the male impregnates it. \\n Following successful impregnation, SCP-4203 will activate, creating a wormhole within the \"heart\" formation. If the formation is broken at this time, then the wormhole will destabilize before gradually dissipating. \\n Within the extra-dimension generated by SCP-4203 is \"Sweety\\'s Emporium of Fine Delicacies, Treats, and the Exotic\" (SCP-4203-1), an invertebrate-themed brothel and nightclub. Numerous entities are believed to reside within SCP-4203-1, with most being employees. \\n Addendum 4203/1: Exploration Log \\n Following its discovery, a preliminary exploration was initially approved by Site-31 staff. Due to the size of the entryway, a Foundation MicroDrone was selected to carry out the mission, despite its limited memory storage. \\n BEGIN LOG \\n The drone enters SCP-4203-1, appearing to emerge in a dimly-lit room. A secondary infrared camera is activated, revealing an entity (ENTITY-A) resembling an enlarged damselfly. It is seen consuming an apparently alcoholic beverage from a large jug. \\n A large tarantula wolf spider (ENTITY-B) scampers into the room. The drone hovers near the ceiling to avoid unintentional contact with either entity. After a few moments, ENTITY-B approaches ENTITY-A. \\n The two entities promptly engage in extensive physical contact with each other. ENTITY-B begins vocalizing moans and whines. A clear liquid is leaking from its abdomen. \\n ENTITY-B raises its front four legs and presses ENTITY-A into a nearby wall. The feed pans slightly, revealing a pair of tibial hooks used by ENTITY-B to pin ENTITY-A\\'s wings to the ceiling. More vocalizations are heard, followed by substantially increased physical interaction. \\n After several minutes, ENTITY-B releases ENTITY-A\\'s wings whilst still embracing. ENTITY-A curls the end segments of its abdomen towards ENTITY-B\\'s posterior lung covers, exposing claw-like genitalia. It begins making a small incision across ENTITY-B\\'s lower abdomen. More clear liquid is seen coagulating into a puddle on the ground. \\n ENTITY-A inserts its genitals into the open wound of ENTITY-B. Further vocalizations are heard. The feed tilts upwards, showing ENTITY-B biting off sections of ENTITY-A\\'s head. One of ENTITY-A\\'s eyes is dislodged and consumed by ENTITY-B. The drone moves closer to the incision site to observe internal movements. \\n An additional incision is made within ENTITY-B\\'s book lungs, allowing access to the sperm receptacle. A four-pronged clasper attached to ENTITY-A\\'s genitals grabs a congealed mass of sperm, drags it through ENTITY-B\\'s lungs, and spills it onto the floor. \\n ENTITY-B retracts its tibial hooks, releasing ENTITY-A from the wall. A chunky white liquid begins dribbling out of ENTITY-B\\'s mouth, followed by it regurgitating two small, metal coins. ENTITY-A retrieves these coins using its clasper before ENTITY-B exits the room. \\n END LOG \\n Afterword: At this point, the MicroDrone indicated that it was unable to record and transcribe additional data and was successfully extracted. Following review by Site-31 staff, further exploratory missions into SCP-4203-1 were postponed due to ethical concerns. \\n « SCP-4202 | SCP-4203 | SCP-4204 »\"', 'SCP-4231': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-4231 \\n THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE CONTAINS GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.1 \\n On 8/29/1989, Commander Richard ABLE (IO) was requested to interview Commander Allen HALL, who lead the first team of responding Foundation personnel into the town of North Access, Cornwall after receiving a direct phone call to the response and dispatch office of the Site-34 outpost in the outskirts of London, approximately 1.3 hours south of the city. The Interview took place at the Site-34 Investigation and Interview lab on 9/02/1989. \\n IO began an initial line of questioning with HALL regarding the general nature of the radio signal as appearing to the outpost. HALL indicated that the outpost had received the signal on the main radar sweep at roughly 2000 hours three days before the initial mission. HALL clarified that he had no teams dispatched at the time of the beacon, and that the radio sweep signaling serviced by the outpost was for responders only and was not serviced by non-Foundation agents, leading him to believe the contact was “of anomalous origin”. The call consisted of the sound of rushing water. HALL could not recall if any other background noises could be detected in the audio of the radio signal. Suspecting a computer error, HALL ended the signal prematurely and returned to attending work. \\n At approximately 0800 hours the following day, the main line of the Site-34 outpost received a second signal, which was received by dispatcher David SHMITT, who indicated to HALL a similar peculiarity with the sound of rushing water. SHMITT indicated in subsequent interviews that although he was unaware of any distinct voices or background noise. HALL instructed SHMITT to triangulate the signal, which was narrowed to the general area of North Access, Cornwall. Once a location had been determined, the signal was terminated. HALL stated that he did not believe that there were any changes in the content of the signal by the time of the termination. IO inquired as to why the investigation was not perused immediately after the second beacon. HALL stated that under normal procedure, a non-foundation beacon is not sufficient to warrant an investigation, but that the audio being transmitted by the signal showed abnormal background radiation consistent with unstable weak hume fields. \\n HALL stated that following the two signaling events, he suggested that he take a crew to investigate the address on the signal’s tracking, concerned about possible anomalous activity affecting the area. HALL assembled a team consisting of SHMITT (dispatcher), Amy WEATSTONE (containment investigator), Ron SHULTZ (MTF), and Rodrik GRIMSKY (technical analysist). The five drove a standard Foundation response vehicle and left the facility at 2000 hours. HALL reported that because of the size of North Access, the town was not listed on standard maps and had to be located using Foundation estimation prior to departure. \\n Allen had worked at a meat packing plant in college. He hadn’t minded it much, actually; most of what he did was a lot of slicing and butchering, and when you really came down to it, that wasn’t a terrible way to make a little over minimum wage per hour. What had bothered him was the smell. \\n The meat was killed and skinned next door, and he’d cut them up fresh in the fridge and hang the carcasses up on hooks to drip. It was a bloody, fresh kind of smell at first, and the meat they actually packaged was relatively fresh save for a little of that, and all things considered he could work with the bloody smell. The smell that bothered him came from the disposed parts he pulled out with a gloved hand and threw into buckets to his left or right- entrails, organs, a stomach here, a heart there, the biology part of the job wasn’t really something that they taught them in training. What he pulled out was relatively nondescript, without definition- an all-encompassing substance of bloody, homogenous gore. Slice and dice, motherfucker. Open the stomach and out with the guts. Like carving a pumpkin. \\n All the nondescript entrails went into the nondescript plastic trash bin. He dreaded when it would get full once or twice a shift, and then the time would come and he would push it on its squeaky wheels over to the grinder. Dump it in, let the machine roar and cough at bits of bone and flesh, and then out would come the pink paste like a bloated, infected finger, a tube of pink shit interlaced with hair and bone between crushed flesh. God knows what they did with it, but that- that would smell. Shit from the entrails, piss from the bladder, blood from everything the fuck else. Another breed of nondescript, homogenous gore. \\n So on that warm August evening as Allen drove the team into North Access, he denied smelling it at first because he’d thought, truly, that he’d never smell it again. \\n But it was there. \\n And when they got closer, it got stronger. \\n HALL stated that approximately half a mile from the outskirts of the town, WEATSTONE inquired to him about the increasing smell permeating the vicinity, to which HALL responded, quote, “Oh, sweet Jesus, it’s bodies”. \\n “Should we-like- god, I don’t know, call for backup or something?” asked David from two seats back. The van bounced over a pothole, and Allen could hear Amy in the passenger’s seat suck in a quick breath of fear. \\n “Not yet,” said Allen. “I might be wrong. Ron, you’ve seen some shit, what do you think?” \\n “It’s something rotting, yeah,” answered the Task Force agent sitting directly behind him. He sounded harrowed, but certain. “It has to be.” \\n Allen nodded silently, anxiety gnawing at his stomach. The five of them sat in silence. Suddenly he wished more than anything that he waited until morning for this- the van’s brights illuminated the road directly in front of them, flanked by sparse trees and farmland on either side. The road was deserted. \\n “How many fucking bodies does it take to smell like that?” whispered Rodrik from the far back of the van, and he heard it and almost wished he hadn’t, because that was exactly the thought that was churning his insides. How many cows did he have to butcher before the grinder meat happened? Two? Three? And that was relatively fragrant to start with. How many fucking bodies did it take to smell it before they even entered the town? \\n “I don’t know,” He responded. Because he didn’t. And he was scared- \\n “Oh my god,” exhaled Amy, “Oh my god, Allen!” \\n He slammed on the breaks just in time to bring the van to a screeching halt in front of a large, low shape, resting on the road. Illuminated by the headlights, Allen was initially terrified because of the sight of fur- he remembers, briefly, the parade of cow hides, the matted sight of hair and blood.\\nIt was a dead horse, and it was rotting. \\n The Cornwall Incident: What Happened? \\n On the early morning of August 1st, 1989, a small team of containment investigators from London enter the small town of North Access, Cornwall- a town of roughly 1,000 residents with an occult history- after receiving several suspicious calls from the location. Upon entering the outskirts of the town, the team quickly encounter a rotting stench so strong they are apprehensive as to their own ability to handle what they might find, and before they are able to enter the town itself, their path is blocked by a dead horse in the road, severely rotted and desiccated. It is at this point that the team calls for backup. \\n By 2 am, three additional containment vans arrive at the entrance to the town. Together, they are able to move the animal’s body from the road. \\n By 3 am, the four teams are able to inch forward roughly a quarter of a mile down the road before they come across the body of a severely desiccated man in his early 40s. They must move his body to proceed. Dutifully, Commander Hall and his crew drag the rotting body to the side of the road to allow the vehicles to pass. \\n By 4 am, Site-34 in London receives word that there are more bodies. \\n By 5 am, Site-56 in Ireland is contacted to send additional vehicles. In fact, they’re contacted to send in a list of squads. North Access is now a locked down crime scene. It will remain so for the next six months. This will become the single most deadly Type Green massacre in history, with an estimated 1,200 people found dead- 1,000 residents and 200 GOC responders from the Ichabod campaign, notorious for killing hordes of reality benders throughout the 80s using the now outdated four class Kant-based diagnostic method. No animals in the area remained alive aside from eight individuals- six pregnant women and a man with a baby- recovered in poor condition. There were signs of heavy flash flooding, but the lake was completely dry. It couldn’t have happened more than three days before. What happened? \\n The truth- as it would soon become apparent- lay in a heavy romantic interaction between two reality benders, dubbed “A” and “B” by investigators… \\n 99% of Type Greens undergo the following sequence of psychological changes as their powers progress. \\n PHASE 1: Denial: The subject refuses to acknowledge their ability to warp reality. The Type Green will attempt to rationalize away their abilities by various means. In some cases, the Type Green will end here: their ability will be self-suppressed, and they will not proceed. However, most then proceed to: \\n PHASE 2: Experimentation: The subject acknowledges their abilities and begins to test the limits of their powers. In general, Type Greens tend to experiment in one of two patterns: slowly, methodically, and carefully, advancing a small amount at a time, or in a small number of sudden jumps. In any case, the subject will generally remain in this mode for some time, before proceeding to: \\n PHASE 3: Stability: The subject reaches the limit of their powers, and determines the boundaries of their abilities. The Type Green achieves control over their reality shifts, and can manipulate them as necessary. More importantly, they can choose not to utilize their abilities, if needed. \\n Phase 3 is usually characterized by attempts to live a \"normal\" life. The subject will continue in normal routines, and aside from necessary precautions to prevent losing control, will utilize their abilities only in private, and only in a manner that will not harm others. These Type Greens may be classified as Threat Level 1 (monitor, do not engage), but should be monitored closely, due to the risk of proceeding to Phase 4. \\n PHASE 4: The Child-God: Sadly, the majority of Type Greens will eventually progress to Phase 4. During this phase, the reality bender becomes obsessed with the power it possesses and will attempt to utilize it for personal gain at the cost of others. This phase is marked by reduced empathy for other humans, inability to accept personal faults, and increased megalomania. \\n Although warning signs are numerous, the key aspect of a Phase 4 is the use of their abilities to manipulate other humans. Teenage and young adult Type Greens will typically use their abilities for sexual purposes… \\n -PHYSICS Division Field Manual 13: Special Circumstances, Humanoid Thread Entities, Published 1984. \\n When they were teenagers she first touched him. \\n They were lying in bed at his house and it was dark, and Lilly knew he wasn’t asleep because he was staring at the ceiling but she did it anyway and maybe pretended that he was asleep, and he owed it to her. He owed this to her, because it must suck, it must suck to always ask and have him always say no, to want him and to always get no as an answer. Sometimes you need to make compromises, he tells himself, in a relationship. Sometimes you need to let it happen for the other person’s sake. \\n So it was raining outside and she touched his chest. There was rain on the roof and rain on the windows and she touched his hips. There was rain on the street and clouds in the sky and she touched him right below the elastic band of his boxers, manicured nails and tips of fingers. The light post outside casts light through the rain and she touches the hair between his legs and his heart picks up speed and at the time he thought it was arousal but would learn later in his life that it was fear and would also learn that there is a fine, \\n Fine, \\n line \\n between the two, \\n And she goes down a little farther, \\n And he feels everything, \\n And she touches the soft skin of the space between his thigh and his crotch, \\n And his heart beats fast and his chest hurts, \\n And then she slides up two of her fingers and touches him and he lets her because he owes this to her, \\n Owes this to her, \\n Owes this to her, \\n You need to be able to do some things for love. \\n Her fingers are on his penis now and he thinks, be aroused. Get turned on. You’re lucky to have her. She curls up to him, blond hair and thin body and the rain outside, sleeping in her jeans, arching her body against strips of orange lamp light filtering through the blinds. \\n You need to do something. \\n Her entire hand is down his pants now, and there is a hot white fear of a thousand lines crossed that keeps him pinned in place like a deer in the headlights. He feels frozen. His heart pounds at her silhouette; for a moment she looks like a predator to him, like something skeletal and powerful, something with a mouth full of canine teeth, and just when she touches the head of his penis it comes rushing in so quickly that his ears ring and he grabs her arm a bit too harshly, too carelessly, too quickly. \\n “Francis.” Muses Lilly. Looking back he sees this as their first encounter, the first time she enters what he would know in another life to be phase two; the phase of power, of control. \\n She’s a goddess, and that isn’t a good thing. \\n For a second, Francis thinks she’s about to throw him off for even daring to touch her. Her eyes are obscured in the light and ridges of her spine are poking out one by one, all the way down her back, just under her skin; she takes his other hand and presses it to her own hip, under her shirt, and he can feel the top of her panties numbly through the buzzing daze but it does not feel like he wants it to feel and he hates it, hates it, hates it— \\n “Francis.” She says when he struggles, trying to work his hand back from under hers against her side, and this time it’s a warning. Her other hand is still on his cock, frozen, and the whole world is intensified, too bright, saturated with hazy light of numb fear like pinworms under his skin, wriggling, jolting. Her other hand sliding his own right under the ridge of her panties, there’s a silhouette of horns like when they were children but it’s just the bare outline like a shadow against the back wall like a red outline from the orange window light that starts to flicker. His chest feels heavy and his soul feels compressed and the world feels stunned and all he thinks is how quickly this happened and how quickly they grew up recreating scenes from Poltergeist and changing the channels on the radio with their minds and bending pennies without touching them and you, you, you with your horns and hooves when you wanted them and you with your mouth filled up with teeth and you with your hunger stronger than his would ever be and that should have been the first indication, looking back, that Francis should have run from her- her with her angry silhouette with water drop shadows and her with her tongue that grew sharper and pierced ever so slightly deeper as they grew and her with her thousand eyes when he only had three and her with her hand around his cock that night with the rain but Francis was young and didn’t know better and Francis trusted her more than anyone and Francis might have even loved her in a strange, fearful way, because Francis didn’t run then and Francis never would until it ended five years later. \\n He yanked her hand from his boxers. She does not talk to him for another week, but he feels her manicured nails and fingertips for a year afterward. \\n He sleeps with his legs crossed for longer. \\n Object Class: Euclid \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4231 exists inside containment area 4231. Containment area 4231 is to be surrounded by a 4-mile-long fence under the guise of government occupation. The front and back doors of SCP-4231 are to be replaced by class 6 metal containment access doors, and all windows on the first floor are to remain boarded up to prevent entry. The entrance to SCP-4231-2 is to be contained by a 34 foot by 34-foot plywood slab placed over the lakebed opening, disguised as a sinkhole repair mechanism. SCP-4231-2 is only to be accessed via the basement of SCP-4231. SCP-2317 is to be removed and placed in separate Foundation containment. \\n Description: SCP-4231 is a three-story house and residential business building in the former town of North Access, Cornwall, previously inhabited by two Type Green entities, SCP-4231-A and SCP-4231-B. \\n SCP-4231-A is a 5’ 7” female, 28 years old, 150 pounds. Fair skin. Brown eyes. Blonde hair. Recently pregnant at time of death. Died of single gunshot wound to head; body found in upstairs bedroom of SCP-4231. Portrayed as the abuser of SCP-4231-B in all resident traumatic imprinting events. \\n SCP-4231-B is a 5’3” male, 27 years old, 145 pounds. Fair skin. One eye blue, one eye green. Blonde hair. At time of recovery, exhibits extreme mental distress; not able to speak to responders coherently. Nose repeatedly broken. Blunt force scars on back of head, back shoulders, buttocks. Repeatedly vomiting water, blood. Kant counter readings indicate level 4 at time of rescue; readings reconcile to level 3 after subsequent hospitalization. Shows signs of heavy psychological trauma following recovery. Authorized for Containment Monitoring Parole (CMP) within the confines of the Foundation on 1/06/1990 (see attached personnel document). \\n The effects of SCP-4231 are referred to as a direct result of violent and extended Type Green occupation of the building, compounded by the effects of the activation of SCP-2317, initially located in SCP-4231-3 directly under the lakebed of North Access. The surrounding town shows signs of extreme flash flooding and decay, and has not been occupied since incident 4231-CORNWALL is under recent development (see document 4231-SCRANTON). The lake itself is entirely drained of water, and the town of North Access has remained a consistent isolated drought affected area since 1989. \\n SCP-4231 sits at the top of the lakeside of containment area 4231, and consists of a top story apartment, a ground-level shop area appearing to be that of a local florist, and a basement, which extends into the earth under the adjacent lake to join with the chamber of SCP-2317 (SCP-4231-3) via a narrow passageway. The top floor of SCP-4231 - designated SCP-4231-2 - shows extensive Type Green traumatic imprinting, to which it owes its anomalous properties. This pocket dimension is considered the most complete case study on imprinting to date, and is widely studied and referenced in conjunction with issues regarding Type Green psychology, violence, and mental illness. SCP-4231-2 consists of a kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom, a nursery, a living room, and an interconnecting hallway. Activity within SCP-4231-2 varies in intensity with time, with seemingly little pattern. For list of events, refer to document SCP-4231-2-A. \\n The basement of SCP-4231 is an unfinished basement housing miscellaneous storage, behind which an entryway to SCP-4231-3 is hidden. \\n Blueprint of SCP-4231-3. Refer to attached documentation for key. Click for enlarged image. \\n SCP-4231-3 is a tomb structure dating to medieval Europe that lies under the lakebed of North Access, Cornwall, bridged by a stone staircase descending from the basement of SCP-4231. It consists of 11 sections: \\n SCP-4231-3-1-7: 5 by 5-meter uniform stone cells with iron doors; originally contained SCP-231-2 through SCP-231-7. Locks were initially impenetrable through non-anomalous means. Six days after initial recovery, Thaumatological specialists succeeded in damaging the locks to a maneuverable degree, allowing all SCP-231 instances to be evacuated. Doors have deliberately been left unlocked for the remainder of the structure’s containment. \\n SCP-4231-3-8: Door frame of SCP-2317. SCP-2317 was removed and transported to proper containment shortly after recovery, leaving an unremarkable stone wall (it appears as if SCP-2317 was always regarded as an interdimensional portal as opposed to an adjoining room, and was affixed with no further structures on the other side). \\n SCP-4231-3-9: Artifact room. Room sealed with 2 identical iron doors. Extensive archeological research and cataloguing has been undertaken in the 9th chamber, with roughly 1,943 separate artifacts recorded (see document SCP-4231-3-A for full list). Notable artifacts include exactly 500 human bones decorated with various strings and fabric (type of bone and types of wrapping vary widely throughout the collection), seven heavily decorated ritual altars, and elaborate carvings of a one-eyed horned beast, thought to resemble SCP-2317. \\n “Binding prayer” (as translated from page 274 of the Erikesh Codex):\\n“In a life before now, I was a powerful beast enslaved to a village, for whom I pulled carts of grain. I was fed and housed and walked among them, but was but a creature speaking their tongue, for which I grew dissatisfied. One night I broke free from my restraints and found myself running wildly in the forest, and the forest did bend around me; my feet were hail and my body thunder. I brought desolation for which I felt nothing, and the earth enabled me with submission. I ran for seven days and seven nights for which time I brought plague on what I did perceive. They called me ꙮ, thuem, web-spinner, the torn-asunder. On the seventh night I was reckless with fatigue and the world did not bend for me. I fell down a steep valley into the River Green; having struck my neck on a boulder, the holy river drowned me in starlight and boiled the flesh from my bones. No creature came for me, for there was no creatures of my kind. The river delivered me; oh how much agony I was in! My broken neck came to rest on the bank of a stream running through a farmer’s field, who was grazing his cattle. He said unto me, “I am not Kether, but I will save you, as you will save me.” He read a holy passage of the Green and carved into my broken neck words of forgiveness, then wrapped it in cloth and twine. I protected his family for four generations; spirit nor creature dared challenge me. The fourth generation blessed me and thanked me and delivered me unto the holy flame. Wildflowers did bloom in my ashes. My power returned to the earth, and I rested soundly. Mercy, mercy, mercy; great is the Red God who binds his angels to the waters. May heaven be merciful on my bones until the Lord pulls upon my yoke once more.” \\n SCP-4231-3-10: 30-Meter-long stone hallway, lit intermittently with torches. Various carvings depicting scenes from the Erikesh Codex adorn the walls (see document SCP-4231-3-B for full translations) \\n SCP-4231-3-11: Stone staircase extending from the basement of SCP-4231. \\n It is unknown how SCP-4231-3 came to be attached directly to the SCP-4231 house, which records show was built in early 1974. This raises the suspicion that SCP-4231-3 may be an intricate replication or creation by SCP-4231-A based on the text of the Erikesh Codex. This theory has not been disproved nor confirmed. Similarly poorly understood is how SCP-4231-3 remained entirely unflooded and undamaged in the course of the Cornwall Incident, thus protecting all SCP-231 instances from harm. This effect, too, is poorly understood. \\n The ground floor of SCP-4231 is an inert flower shop. \\n He arises from bed in the early hours of the morning when Lilly is beside him but the baby has not kicked yet for the first time. He still feels what she’s done to him- what she did to him in the dusk by the water- bruises down his back, then on his pelvis, then- he didn’t want to look that closely at himself. It’s the first time he’s gotten out of bed in two days. He feels disconnected, like his arms aren’t his arms and he exists slightly to the left of his body. It’s the first time he’s experienced that sensation since the night on the lake shore. It is not the last time he will experience it. \\n Francis stands near the bedroom door for a moment, trying to decide if the ringing in his ears is real or not, then if his body is real or not. He isn’t sure where he’s going, but when he opens the door to the bedroom into the hallway he finds that there isn’t any place to go. The bathroom door across the hall has disappeared. The kitchen to the left is gone. \\n if they ever existed in the first place, he wonders. But Francis is not one for wandering to check. Not now. \\n “Hello?” he calls absently, soft and confused. The word doesn’t sound like his own. It echoes: hello? ello? lo? lo? lo? \\n And if his voice hits a boundary- somewhere far into the hallway that’s extended past the house, past the tomb, past the lake and past North Access into a place he’s constructed without knowing it, where the water expands in an endless tide and to where all roads in his life now end- he does not hear it. And if Lilly hears it, she doesn’t stir. And if anything else were to hear it- \\n Well. \\n And then, of course, there is B. \\n The Foundation never seems to know exactly what to do with B, the placid Type Green who trapped himself at the top of the Montauk house with his newborn child to escape the ritual floods. He sits in a grey area between something containable and an innocent bystander caught up in something he could not control. B- upon interviewing- is not aware of SCP-231, or SCP-2317, or, quite frankly even SCP-4231, the reality construct he has accidentally created to escape the abuse inflicted by his closest childhood friend. When the initial teams reach SCP-4231, a chase ensures; they run B down through miles and miles of repeated passageways and winding corridors stretching from the roof of SCP-4231, and he simply expands it further. When the teams find that they are no longer able to contact base in North Access, they smoke him out with sleeping gas and drag him back to the world of the living. There\\'s debate among the teams on the ground at whether or not he should be handcuffed onto the stretcher they hold him on. This is the first debate of many. \\n The problem with B is that he is something that- according to norms surrounding Type Greens at the time- he should not be: traumatized. It\\'s evident as soon as they get him on the ground. Here is a Class 3 Type Green with PTSD and extreme dissociative symptoms so severe they manifest in recreating his own trauma in painfully evident symptoms: B vomits filthy water originating from the flood he attempted to escape. He wakes up from nightmares with bruises and cuts in very specific places on his body. His dissociative episodes cause mild spacial abnormalities in his surroundings. Certain traits about B become more solidified as time goes on, when he goes about adapting an entirely different personality to combat the trauma; the new B is eccentric, flamboyant, even bordering on inflammatory towards others. The deep mental distress and accompanying physical illness that keeps him bedridden in the two weeks immediately following his extraction from SCP-4231 disappear. The new B knows nothing, or, at least, appears to know very little about what has transpired to put him in this situation. He no longer inquiries about the child, or about A, or the town of North Access where he has lived all his life. The signs of body dysphoria stemming from the Montauk Procedure are either gone or deeply hidden. \\n But the nightmares, the flashbacks, and the dissociative episodes- along with their accompanying reality bending Freudian slips- persist. \\n In fact, the new B seems to embrace certain aspects of his inability to control himself as well as he did before the Cornwall Incident. The most evident symptom doctors notice while B is still in medical containment is his newfound reaction to cameras. He does not want to be filmed. While he asserted this verbally before his transition, doctors treating B chocked this behavior to his mental instability and refused to comply with his distressed pleas to remain anonymous not only on camera, but in all aspects of the investigation, a reaction which seemed to intensify his mental symptoms dramatically. After his transformation, he simply obscures his face in any form of recorded media. \\n So this presents the Foundation with another interesting situation. Here they have placed an individual suffering from severe trauma in a cage, and begin to build an altar to fix it. The individual requests anonymity, including expunging of his birth name from all documents. The Foundation refuses to comply, citing accuracy and the continued tracing of his whereabouts throughout the rest of his life. He requests that he not be filmed. The Foundation refuses to comply on the grounds that his interview sessions are vital for study, and include his facial and body language and behavior. He requests that the Foundation stop probing for more information regarding the violence and abuse leading up to the Cornwall Incident, including information regarding A, SCP-231, SCP-2317, or SCP-4231, as much of his experience is highly distressing to him and/or has been forgotten or forcefully blocked out during his mistreatment, and some of it he was never made aware of at all. The Foundation does not comply, insisting that his continued compliance in the investigation of the Cornwall Incident and all related items and beings in containment is vital to the success of the Foundation\\'s interference. He asks that they not test his vomit. He asks that he not be touched. He asks that they remove Hume reading electrodes and equipment from his neck and spine, and that they remove the reality anchor from his hospital room. B is accepting of treatment for his traumatic disorder and is responsive to medication and the beginning phases of grief and cognitive behavioral therapy- so long as anything he says remains confidential to him, and not recorded in Foundation record. All of these requests the Foundation denies, and B\\'s condition in the first two weeks of his containment worsens significantly. He asks- in stunning, repeated detail- that he be left alone and out of the Foundation\\'s documentation. Not only for now, but for the rest of his life. And the Foundation treats him more as an animal or as a test subject then as a person, and refuses to comply. \\n So he simply stops allowing it. \\n This is not technically a breach by Foundation standards. B still stays in his chamber and does not use his abilities to injure or attempt to leave the chamber. \\'Breach\\', in Foundation terms, only applies if the entity leaves the chamber without the explicit permission of Foundation staff, meaning that many forms of civil disobedience by entities, including hunger strikes and refusal to speak to staff or move from chambers when requested, are commonly utilized. His radical transformation into a new personality appears to be less of a worsening of his dissociative condition and more of a transition into a being so blatantly disrespectful and infuriating that staff interaction results in only frustration. He now refuses all medication and therapy to control his condition, attempts to abruptly derail any conversation relating to his condition, uses his powers to obscure his face from any recorded imagery, and simply goes about breaking any equipment placed in his cell for monitoring his condition. He rips out IV lines and EKG patches, smashes Kant counters, and deliberately insults and belittles staff. The symptoms of his PTSD continue with consequences ranging from night terrors and panic attacks to dissociative episodes and reality affecting events, but he learns to mask the affects as soon as staff step in to respond, leading to a comical sort of whiplash: on one tape we see a nurse rush in to wake him from a nightmare as his traumatic injuries reappear and begin to bleed. She wakes him and helps him vomit up floodwater as usual, then inquires as to his condition, to which he responds- and I quote- \"Nice legs, daisy dukes\". When she leaves, B uses the resulting isolation to cry.\\n-Lady Agora, Sigilmaster, Translator, Worshipper of many. 4/23/1995 \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: SCP-4231-B \\n So it’s civil disobedience. I guess my reaction to that is that it really doesn’t seem like a big deal, seeing as -17 has dealt with full on hunger strikes in the past few years. One individual shouldn’t be a huge problem. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: SCP-4231-B \\n I was more under the impression that the question here was to contain or not to contain. Seeing the relevance of this issue, I think it would be best to lay out what we have so far here: \\n -Class 3 Type Green male in his mid-twenties. High control, placid temperament, abstinence code on his powers. Seems to see them as more of a medical disability than anything else. \\n -Worked in the now decimated GOC Ichabod campaign under the codename ‘Ukulele’. Apparently not too bad. Has a solid record under his belt- so solid that it borders on obsessive, and some of his latter kills are pretty gruesome. \\n -Was in an abusive relationship with another Type Green (SCP-4231-A, or SCP-231-1 depending on who you ask at the moment) for the past seven years. Unclear as to who the abuser was currently, due to the inherent abusive nature of many Type Greens in general. More info to come on that. \\n -Murdered SCP-231-1 soon after she gave birth to their child, who was taken from SCP-4231-B’s custody at the scene. Birth apparently coincided with the Cornwall Incident. \\n -Was pursued by task forces for roughly twenty-four hours, but had been running from the scene for longer. \\n -Deeply disturbed. They’re saying PTSD right now, with some heavily dissociative symptoms. Reality bending powers coincide with flashbacks and psychological symptoms when they occur. Problems sleeping, problems talking, problems remembering things and remaining grounded. Pretty nasty stuff. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n “Unclear as to who the abuser was currently, due to the inherent abusive nature of many Type Greens in general.” \\n This is blatantly wrong. We know that A was the abuser and the orchestrator of this entire goddamn shitshow, and we have B’s traumatic imprints on the upstairs apartment to account for that, as well as his testimonies. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n I don’t trust his testimonies. He killed the other one, didn’t he? He could have just as easily orchestrated this entire thing as a cover-up, including the traumatic imprinting. Look at the evidence. If he worked on Ichabod for so many years, he’s probably seen every type of imprinting in the book, and probably knows how to make a damn convincing one. This whole sudden personality change doesn’t bode well with his playing the victim, either. And why else would he be running away? And 8 already brought up the gruesome killings towards the end of his duration at the Insurgency. I don’t think he’s placid. I think he’s playing us like a fiddle. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n If he was playing with us, we’d know by now. His Kant fingerprint would be through the roof. And we’d be dead. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n There’s certainly a lot going on here, but my most pressing question is regarding Montauk itself. \\n If A was the abuser, she would also have to be the conductor of the Montauk Procedure, not only on B but on SCP-231-2 through SCP-231-7. There’s the very important point of how she managed impregnating those women without the aid of SCP-4231-B, and if he was involved, that destroys his story of having no knowledge that the procedure was taking place and in conjunction his story of abuse. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n Genital and body modification aren’t uncommon in Type Greens, especially in those suffering from bodily dysmorphia or dysphoria. As for the sexual abuse of B- this isn’t surprising to me either, especially if B was coerced or wrongfully forced to consent under the threat of violence. Do we have an autopsy of A’s body yet? \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n Scranton is doing it. When he’s done, we also need to discuss if we’ll release the body to B or let Robert\\'s anchor team take it. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n So B has no control over his partner, as well as no control over his child? Are we just not going to give him any sense of closure at all? \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n That circles back to the ‘contain or not to contain’ concern. If he’s to be contained, then we have every right to put his child in better hands permanently, and in conjunction can do with the body what we wish. We also can’t ignore that B is a murderer who killed A- would we give a murderer rights to his child, or to his wife’s body, or to closure at all? \\n As for his mental changes- he seems very mentally ill to me, which is furthering the case for containment for both his safety and the safety of others regardless of his role at Cornwall. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n He should absolutely have the right to closure in my eyes. \\n From: [REDACTED] \\n To: O5 [group] \\n Subject: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: re: SCP-4231-B \\n Hi everyone, \\n I see that you’ve been busy with this issue. There’s a lot to unpack here, and with the cleanup only two weeks in progress I’m confident there will be more information to come. The issues concerning B’s right to closure, as well as his rights to testify for himself and refuse or consent to various testing procedures, are issues for the Ethics committee; I propose the counsel meet to discuss solely the handling of the containment situation with SCP-4231 and all its various assets. \\n For now, SCP-231-2 through SCP-231-7 are being held at Site-17 high security holding cells alongside SCP-4231-B. The child seems to be relatively normal, and is being held in a lower security holding situation with various accommodations for her extremely young age. Alternative solutions about adoption in the Cornwall area are up for consideration in the meantime. \\n Remember to proceed as carefully as possible with issues pertaining to the Montauk procedure, the details of which are currently being extracted from the Erikesh Codex and lined up with new evidence being extracted from the SCP-4231-3 archeological dig. \\n The containment for SCP-4231-B remains at basic medical monitoring for the time being. Testing will resume when decisions on his mental health, involvement, threat level, and rights are made. I suspect a more pressing concern regards the Montauk ritual, and the apparent consequences that will have. B is the least of our worries at the moment. We are running out of time. \\n I will send out the conference meeting times shortly. \\n Cheers, \\n O5-1 \\n The Foundation does not neglect its chambers. \\n It is easy for us, as onlookers, to see the chambers as a relative footnote to a more complicated piece. Largely this is what we see; in the report overview we see the Containment Procedures, a short paragraph brushed over by the report writers and those being briefed on what the chamber is holding alike. The safe object is contained by a locker. A humanoid, contained in a room. The chambers are second hand entities; we are not interested in the box, but rather the jewels it holds, and it’s in this way that the procedures are neglected by those who it does not seem to affect. \\n It’s a given that the Foundation is strict in its following of the cover paper, that awe-inspiring summary article with sheafs and sheafs of raw test data, paperwork, months or years of observation behind it. No, it’s silly to think that that the Foundation would invest so much time and effort into something that would not matter, and in reality we as the cover page people we all miss the extreme amount of Disney World Magic that goes into the chambers, most of it kept from the summary reports we see as unimportant details. The Foundation has people for this job. If you are reading the summary report, you are not one of those people. If you are one of those people, your job does not lie in the main report, but in the interpretation of the report. Foundation Containment Engineers review the containment team’s sheafs and sheafs of files and design something that borders on a prison, a feat of architecture- some might call it art- and they do it every day, with each SCP we see a report for. Isn’t that grand? A 5x5 cell for an electrochemical anomaly becomes a purely mechanical containment vessel void of electric components. A little reality bender’s room uses pink wallpaper to cover steel reinforcements and the occasional strategic pressure plate and panic button. The engineers read the endless papers and discuss amongst themselves; they find the essence of what is needed. They are building a prison cell and a home and a tool for science and altars, yes, they build altars too, and the altars are oh so carefully tended, so methodically pacified. \\n There is not a hair out of place on a Foundation altar. It is the bridge between science and religion. The pig’s blood is measured in liters with graduated cylinders in a prep room and the black cats are purebred for the purpose of the slaughter. The irony in how relentless the Foundation is with its worship of a hundred, two hundred, three, four, five hundred different angry deities is. Not even a contained god’s most devout followers on the outside are as ruthless as this; there are no murders on the altar of a decaying backwoods church and no blood spills on the floor. This is part of the chamber, part of the grand design, that sweet Disney Magic that makes it all happen. The chambers of the Foundation are made to maximize the effect; the magnifying glass using the sun to fry an ant into the pavement. \\n I do not know of the men who built the Montauk chamber. I do not know if they forgot, if they were allowed to forget. Montauk- and I will say this many times in many different ways- is an illness in that it spreads to all who touch it, and this is a perfect demonstration of this principle. Who were they? Where did they live, and where did they go? The hands who cure the altar metal are the hands that praise the god; the men who draw a row of little boxes and label them SCP-231-2, SCP-231-3, all the way through the 7th with their fine felted drafting pens and cruel straight edges are the men who locked those girls in the hell they made. \\n But I digress in my ramblings. The chamber, yes. \\n The chamber discussed in the 231 document does what it is allotted to disclose. We are told the following: \\n -The Foundation needs two sets of operational staff: staff to complete procedure-110-Montauk, and staff to watch it. This is aside from all the staff that aren’t usually discussed in the Foundation- mutinous staff (at least one crew per SCP), containment medical staff to work on anomalies (especially important here), a warden and guards (this facility specifically is one of the highest security sites in the world), and janitorial and cafeteria staff. You will wonder why this is important. I promise you that it is important. \\n -Everyone who enters SCP-231 has to be transported through several different routes and means of transportation. This begs the question: if you’re blindfolded, and I’m blindfolded, then who’s flying the plane? There are people out there in the world who know the exact location of SCP-231’s facility, and I must admit, not even I have seen it with my own eyes. I know where it is in theory, although I am not at liberty to say that here. As for the route itself- well. That doesn’t matter here. Some say that it doesn’t matter at all. \\n -The personnel who are in the observation booth wear full-body protective covering that obscures not only their face, but also their voice. It’s implied that even menial staff on site must wear this clothing. \\n -The personnel who are in the observation booth are to remain in their own provided quarters when they are not attending the booth. So for two months, these individuals see only their own face in their bathroom mirror and the girl’s face in the chamber. They hear only their own voice in their quarters and the girl’s voice over the observation booth microphone. \\n Those are the two major things discussed. You will notice here that we aren’t told about the chamber itself. It’s typical in cover documents for the authors of the containment teams involved with sapient entities to disclose both the means of external containment- special procedures that allow the SCP to remain contained- and the means of internal containment, the mental protection, books, entertainment, the regulations of interaction. We are given the vague external containment methods, and nothing else. So, we’re left to speculate- that is, unless you’ve heard the stories, or done some slightly illegal digging in the archive site in Quebec. You would be surprised what the Foundation keeps around at those low-security archive sites. \\n The chamber of SCP-231 is a concrete monstrosity in an undisclosed desert. It’s entirely subterranean, but boasts a maze-like array of hallways and dead ends to reach the real containment site at all; not surprising in modern Foundation terms, I know, but very innovative for when the site was constructed in late 1989. You may be wondering how they managed to build it so quickly, and the answer lies in the fact that the site being erected in that plot of land at the time was a small safe-class site, which was quickly readapted to the keter arrangements after the famed Cornwall Incident. So the layout of SCP-231’s containment is unusual even outside the norm of unusual; there are abandoned lockers in dead-end hallways, empty rooms with eternally pending designations, lights that are never turned on. Think a cave. A long, winding, claustrophobic cave. \\n At the heart of the building are the chambers and the dormitories. \\n The chambers are a set of seven- yes, seven, but only six are filled- humanoid containment cells. They are made of concrete. There isn’t much more that I could discern from what I was able to steal, and from what I’ve heard through the grapevine, except that each chamber is neighbored to an investigation room for the purposes of the Montauk procedure. The one-way glass lies to the right of each chamber, with the next chamber on the right from that, and the adjoining room, etc. When the investigation team assigned to this SCP watches the procedure, they see it from the ground floor looking in, so the danger is only a sheet of glass away. I’ve heard conflicting reports over whether or not there are bars on the window. On one hand, I suspect that they are; generally on larger sites, all ground-level observation booths are reinforced. On Site-17, for example, all windows have a carbon shield on top of the reinforced glass; but on Site-19, many ground-level containment booths are reinforced with metal bars. That being said, Site-19 is the older of the two, and has a history based in the Stalin era, complete with running ins with the Russian government- but again, I digress. The history of these buildings are a subject for another essay altogether. \\n What is vital to note about this setup is the focus on visibility. Visibility- and what it causes- are part of the core of the procedure, a hallmark of Montauk as an age-old religious rite. Could you see the procedure through the bars? Most likely, but would they risk it? Again with the fixation on precision, the exactness of worship. I suspect there are no bars between the observers and the subject. \\n In the observation booth, there are five personnel. It’s not clear how the committee behind this containment decided on 5. \\n So I would like to lay out a scene for you, dear reader, of what it’s like to work on SCP-231. \\n You arrive at the site, and they have you change into your new uniform before you leave it, upon which you are greeted by a member of support staff, also in suit, who then leads you through a shabby-looking disguised outpost under the ground. There’s an elevator for the first three floors, and from there you must proceed on foot. How far down do you go? How long does it take? You see empty lockers, empty doors, ruminants of a site that does not hold what it believes it holds, or of residual humanity. The way you are taken is nonsensical. You are not informed of how to behave, or what your job is; they take you to your quarters and they hand you a booklet, and that booklet outlines your job for the next two months. The quarters have no internet or radio, because access to local channels might hint to you as to which desert you currently reside in; although you do have a TV attached to a single DVD player. It cannot connect to channels on the outside. They bring you food. You have a list of DVDs and books you may request, and this is what you may do when you are not working. You do not have a phone, but you have a bed. And you have a bathroom with a mirror. And before you leave each morning to watch the girl, you have your uniform that you wear. And it obscures your face, and your voice. And everyone else also has their face and voice obscured. So the only face and voice you see in your two months there is the girl’s and your own, and it’s in this state that you see the Montauk procedure. Multiple times. Over and over. And then you go back to your cell- sorry, your quarters- and you sit. \\n After your two months are over, you are shipped back to the real world. And most likely, that experience has changed you. Most likely, you are much different. Most likely- and this is the kicker, this is the thing that they fucked up with- you will never be the same. And this is what they call the Montauk procedure. \\n It isn’t about what happens in the chamber. The god doesn’t care about that. What it cares about is that when you leave, you are not the same, and that is the essence of the procedure. It is torture for not only the girl, but also for yourself. \\n Think about how many people go through. Two months. Five people per girl. So in the beginning, in 1989, that would be 30 people per two-month period. 360 people per year walking away with the red right hand of god on their shoulder. In less than 3 years, 1,000 people are changed. The will of a god is the control of the worshipper, and it’s a funny thing, Montauk, because what do you do? What does it mean to be controlled by fear? Do you cure yourself of it? Do you learn to live alongside it? Do you kill yourself? Do you strive to live? How do you free yourself from the Montauk procedure; how do you kill a god? \\n I have been a sigilmaster my entire life. I am a witch of the old breed- I have been taught many things about gods, and I have seen many in many forms. In 1967, when I was pregnant with my first and only child, I was approached on commission by the Foundation to decrypt the Erikesh Codex. This was not my first commission for a consult from them or a related agency, so I took the job and translated the best I could. \\n The codex itself is a subject for yet another essay. The runes were old and strange- I recall it being very difficult. I finished the job shortly after my son was born. If I had known to what conclusion my translation of the work would lead, I’m not sure if I would have taken it. If I had known it would find its way into the hands of my son’s childhood friend- if I had known what would happen to him- If I had known. If I had not left him early. If I had taken him with me when I ran. If his father was still alive. If I had killed him as soon as I knew of his abilities, instead of raising him to never lift a finger in the face of danger to himself. What would be different? \\n See how Montauk has spread to me, dear reader? See how this procedure operates? How many people see it and are changed…and how many are changed from seeing their loved ones changed? How many people wake in the night, their fear feeding a hungry god? \\n My biggest fear regarding the rituals of SCP-231 is this: that it is not about the children, and has never been. That the chains break when the red god wants them to- when enough people are fearful.\\n-Lady Agora, Sigilmaster, Translator, Worshipper of many. 2/28/2004. \\n “And people always ask me, when I tell them this statistic [that 99% of type greens will progress to stage 4 of their condition within their lifetime], ‘What about the others?’ or ‘What about the 1% that don’t?’ and that’s the primary concern I’m seeking to address today. The Ichabod Campaign is a hard thing to come to terms with for many people studying Hume Theory behind the curtain. \\n It’s important to note when addressing these things that contrary to popular belief, Type Greens were not prematurely killed until recently. For a long time the industry standard was to only seek out Type Greens when they had caused something to draw attention to themselves to necessitate their being killed; the sudden disappearance of someone important, for example, or a string of murders with little causation attached, which would be completed with a chaotic and unorganized hunting mission usually described as a ‘witch hunt’. It wasn’t until the development of Hume theory and subsequent primitive Kant Counters in the late 1950s that it became possible to determine and quantify the disposition of power in certain individuals, and it wasn’t until the Global Occult Coalition launched the Ichabod Extermination Campaign in the early 1970s that it became the norm to seek out and destroy these individuals as they came about into the world. \\n The Ichabod Campaign was a logical next step with the development of long-range and more accurate Kant devices. I don’t blame the industry for taking that turn, especially when it seemed like such a damn perfect solution to such a damaging problem. If you could prevent a Type Green from entering the phase 4 power stage, you could also prevent the type green from entering the phase 2 power stage and all the precarious testing of boundaries that came with it; why wouldn’t you? To outsiders it would sound like something along the lines of genocide, but it was different behind the curtain where you could see the damaging effects these individuals could cause (keyword could). \\n It was this kind of thinking that kept the Foundation from immediately lashing out to shut down this campaign. We didn’t agree with it, and we didn’t condone it, either. It would be a lie to say that we never initiated individual missions to kill certain individuals prematurely, but we never launched a movement on such scale and with such force as Ichabod, and we didn’t protest it either, because the thing about Ichabod was that it was effective. Ethical? Moral? Both are in the eye of the beholder, but damages caused by Type Greens of all power levels and abilities dropped dramatically in the 1970s onward, and we turned a blind eye to it. There would be people always saying why the hell didn’t you stop it, because had it not been Type Greens you would have used every resource in your possession to stop that campaign before it got off the ground, and that’s true, but it was because Type Green attacks and level changes before Ichabod were so deadly and damaging to the outside that it was overlooked. \\n It’s like this: Why don’t animal rights activists speak out against people using mousetraps in their homes? Because mice have been pests for centuries. They’ve caused countless deaths through disease and they cause damage to the building. The same people will speak out against their being used in research because of its apparent unethical standard, and yet won’t speak out against them being senselessly slaughtered via suffocation. We don’t even know if the mice they\\'re killing deserve to be killed, or if they’re just babies, and we don’t care, because if we were to let mice roam around our homes in large numbers it would be catastrophic. And the same thing is with Type Greens; people speak against their containment, the use of them in studies regarding psychic ability and Hume theory, in Kant counter tests, but most of all they speak out against the mutilation of their bodies for [REDACTED], a practice that remains common today. \\n But no one spoke against Ichabod. And so, Ichabod never stopped. It’ll be reaching its 30th anniversary this year. The average Ichabod agent has about 50-150 kills under their belt over the course of their career; the average Ichabod strike team can have anywhere from 300-500. The reality is that containing every Type Green would be impossible because type greens are more common than it’s usually let on. \\n The next question commonly asked is then what about SCP-239? What makes her so special? And the answer is that she’s here for testing. She’s here to make a better world, but she isn’t special. The average lifespan of a type green is 19 years old, because they most often begin transitioning to stage 4 at around 17. 239 was born in 2003 and has been in stage 3 for 4 years as of writing. Maybe she’ll be part of the 1%, a perfect case study as to how containing and raising these children in an environment that gives them clear boundaries and expectations for them while allowing them a safe environment to explore their abilities has significant impact on how they develop as adults. Maybe she’ll enter stage 4 and destroy us all. \\n But for now, the statistics are startling: In its heyday in the 80s, the GOC\\'s Ichabod campaign killed nearly 75% of all Type Greens, but regulations have tightened since then. The lifespan of a Type Green \\'in the wild\\', referring to greens not being affected, tracked, or protected by a GoI, is around 19; around the same age that these individuals often induce their own demise by entering stage 4 of development. \\n In the 1980s, the average lifespan was 8 years old, because this was the age that Ichabod often found and killed them. And we did nothing.” \\n -[REDACTED], February 8th, 2010 \\n It’s the mid 1980s, and he’s just gotten the blood washed off his arms from the last mission, patched himself up, scheduled himself for another so he wouldn’t have to go home, and he calls Lilly like he always does and there’s something about the way she calls him a liar for the millionth time that breaks him. Maybe it was the stress, maybe it was the six months of solid missions, maybe it was the lack of sleep or the way his hands trembled, but he’s Agent Ukulele standing in the telephone booth at the bus station and he starts crying while still on the phone, while she’s still berating him for some stupid little mistake he made on a check he sent home. He’s stupid, he’s fat, and no one will ever love him like she does, he’s so goddamn lucky to have her, he’s permanently indebted to her for everything she does for him, and more than anything he’s a liar. His memories are wrong, there are things she did not say and things she did not do. In a week this phone call will not exist, because Francis is crazy- yes- Francis is in the process of losing control of his powers, and it’s only a matter of time before they find out, and he’d better come home away from where they could find him, he’d better come home where she could keep an eye on him, he was dying, he was going to die, and only she could save him. \\n It’s one of those moments that he’d see more in the Foundation, in another life far from now- a brief mental lapse, a break of a stitch in a seam. He hangs up the phone and shakes and sobs and thinks about how he’s losing control and wonders how long he’ll have left before his own fellow agents find out and murder him. He wonders if it’ll be fast, and if they’ll kill Lilly too, and how much of his life he was making up with unintentional little slips of Hume malfunction. He wonders if he’s making this up, too. He wonders if he’s going crazy, or if he’s already too far gone. He can’t help but cry.\\nThe breakdown is fast and complete. He sits on the floor of the phone booth at a dingy greyhound station and sobs through a mixture of panic and grief, and then just like that the announcement for the next bus comes over the intercom and he switches back from one person to another. \\n Things were crumbling. His breath is fast and his emotions fading like fog burnt in the morning light. Time was running out and things were crumbling, and he isn\\'t quite sure what he senses that is changing, or what he needs to stop or do or even if he can do either of those things at all. She used to be different. She used to be kind. \\n Something was changing in her, thinks Francis from a dark recess of his mind he doesn\\'t want to reminisce on. She was changing- and soon she would be no different from anything he would be paid to kill. Wasn’t that horrible? Wasn\\'t that just fucking terrible? \\n Unless it was him who was changing. Unless it was him who was turning into a monster. \\n Francis stops crying so abruptly it hurts. Agent Ukulele stands. It\\'s a moment that his brain blacks out of his memory. He walks out of the phone booth more bored than anything, and gets on the bus to a remote Type Green lair in Huston, and some part of him cries you are different, you are changing, and something terrible is about to happen. \\n July 30th, 1989, 1300 hours, Undisclosed Facility in Newcastle, England \\n ‘Coda’- as they were known- leans close to the screen, knee bouncing intently.\\nThey were an exceptionally young Coda to take that rank. Head dispatcher and Quartermaster wasn’t a job that was taken lightly at the GOC; at the right hand of D.C. al Fine, it was a momentous role for even an experienced worker. But they were smart, this Coda. Exquisitely so. The best they could find on short notice- maybe the best they could find, period. Not one for people, but had focus like a laser beam, stamina like a bull. Focus and stamina had not been the strong suits of the last Coda. It had been a gory end for him. \\n The new Coda didn’t like to think about that. They were here to do a job- and the job had not been kind to them lately. The individual sitting hunched over the broad computer bank spanning the length of the room could feel the winding down of the Cornwall mission in the strain in their back, the tightness in their shoulders, the bags under their eyes. They have been up for nearly thirty-two hours. But it’s almost over, they tell themselves in the tight florescent of the command room, headphones blaring a harsh mix of radio feeds so bright and blunt that they know they’ll feel the throbbing buzz in their ears for hours afterwards; It has to be almost over now. \\n The last nine months of Coda’s work had gone approximately like this: \\n It was a routine Hume check, and the agents in the squad had reported to them what they had found. Coda had told them to peruse the radiation (it had been mild then- a quick in and out). They did not return. They sent out more teams. Those did not return. They dispatched further teams to investigate, tracked it to one single house and the lake beside it, and then suddenly they did not return. This Coda had put all their eggs in one basket as they moved nearly 200 Ichabod campaign members- nearly half of their entire division- into the town of North Access over the course of the past nine months. The threat had been escalating. The reality of the town was becoming increasingly unstable overall, but in particular the state of the flower shop where agents went and did not return was disturbing to say the least. \\n The last thirty minutes of Coda’s work had gone approximately like this: \\n They send out a squad of 30 when the Hume levels drop, suddenly and without warning. It’s a weak spot they aren’t expecting and Coda practically screams into the headset to take the bombs and head out, because goddamn it if they can pull this off this whole thing will be over in half a minute. The squad leaders Coda is talking to directly report that there’s some flash flooding from the rain, and they tell them to try to drive through it. The squads say they can’t. \\n So Coda tells them to walk. \\n Some would question Coda’s ethics regarding this part. Could the teams run away through the water fast enough to escape the impending explosion, or any retaliation from the Type Green lair housed within the building? It was hard to tell, but one reason Coda had been picked for this job was for their risk taking. So this was a gamble they decided to take that night. \\n The water is coming down harder. The bombs: 25 pounds each, 6 of them, fitted with a short-term reality anchor device. Experimental. The goal was to rip through the outer field and blow up the house. The bombs aren’t known for their ease of access, so the men hurry to set up the wires and batteries, and in a half an hour the water goes from being knee-deep to waist deep and the bombs are ready and Coda can barely hear the commanders over the unending downpour. \\n And this is when the new Coda makes their first mistake: they hesitate. \\n They could have gotten the strike team out of there in ten minutes if they needed to. They could have done a thousand things differently if they knew what was about to happen. Men can swim in water, they thought. The water wouldn’t be an issue, they assumed. The water was up to their chests now, he heard. But that wouldn’t be a problem. That wouldn’t be a problem. That wouldn’t be a problem until it got hot, very quickly- once the bombs were set and being splashed with the newfound waves- the water started getting hot, and it’s a slow progression in which Coda finds that this is happening. The commanders say that it’s unusually warm. Then they say that it’s getting hot, like a sauna, and then they stop being so vocal about it because it stops being funny, and Coda is left reeling, trying to find answers and suddenly getting none. \\n The bombs do not detonate. The equipment was not made to be submerged. How funny is that? How incredibly coincidental, intoxicatingly cruel that of course the equipment was not made to withstand a boiling flood. \\n So Coda listens on their headset as seven hours away, the water flooding the town of North Access, Cornwall comes to a sudden boil. They jump from keyboard to keyboard and over the next half an hour every single agent they have access to the headset of goes offline, one by one. And then the agents back at camp go offline, one by one. And then all they could hear on any of the online headsets was the endless rush of rain. \\n The recordings are somewhere. Coda has never listened to them, but they know that somewhere in the depths of the shallow GOC archives, they exist. They consist of what they assume to be roughly 2 hours of the sounds of death, followed by 48 hours of Coda asking repeatedly for a response. There were a couple times they reached their search beyond their boundaries into the neighboring towns, onto some long-wave stations \\n (accidentally giving out a homing signal redirected from half-functioning abandoned equipment in north access, to be picked up on not one, but two separate occasions by a classified outpost in London) \\n but they came back. And there was always nothing. \\n And there continued to be nothing until the Foundation crews came, and the real mess had begun. \\n Chestnut had never felt such pain. \\n She knew when the stable began to flood that things were not how they were supposed to be. THE MAN usually kept her stable clean, and when it wasn’t, tied her reigns to the post outside to give him room to clean it. And the stable had never flooded like this before. It was up past her hooves before he burst in- slamming back the barn doors to shed light on her and the five other horses, who had been getting restless in the past hour of persistent flooding- panting, soaked, and throwing up the latches on the horses’ stalls. \\n One by one they ran. Stormy charged out the front with no shortness of panic, hooves slamming into the six inches of water on the wooden floor like thunder into the greasy black world beyond the swaying stable lights. Rio was dumb with panic at the opening of her stall, rearing up and tearing at THE MAN, eyes rolling in their sockets- she hit the barn door on her way out in her disorientation, almost sending her careening across the submerged grass before she caught her footing and dashed into the night. Gulch managed to break down the door to his stall before THE MAN could reach the latch, frightened by the rate of the water pouring into the barn from a knothole in the wood behind him, and bolted with the precision of a racehorse from the swaying building, and then it was just Chestnut and THE MAN, and THE MAN had a saddle. \\n She was his best and brightest, and certainly his bravest. Not but nine months ago had his wife- the town librarian- disappeared into thin air, and it had been Chestnut he had gone to in his grief. She was spooked, but not like the others. Never like the others. And the car wouldn’t start and the town was going under, and damn if they weren’t making it out of this mess alive. \\n The water was significantly deeper outside the barn. It came up to her knees when she exited, cold and harsh and filthy. Through the gale force winds she could see cars and buildings submerged deeper than she had ever seen anything submerged before, and the water rushed outward with seemingly no direction but the lake. She turned in tandem with THE MAN. They were leaving. They were going away. She never imagined that they would go away. \\n Her muscles pounded through the water in an uncoordinated chaos, slipping and churning, gaining ground and losing it, finding potholes and submerged fences that tore through her flank and threw her off balance, but she remembered what they were doing: AWAY, AWAY, they were going AWAY from the strange feelings she had felt towards the lake for months, AWAY from the missing woman and AWAY from the strange deer-horned creature she had witnessed take her nine months before. It was clear that THE MAN was struggling to see through the storm, and she had only her feet to guide her as to where the water was and where it wasn’t; when her feet hit the pavement of the entrance to the town she surged forward and ripped from the tide down the road, still struggling in the dark and the rain, bristling and hurting. She and THE MAN were going AWAY, and although she did not know where that was she was certain that THE MAN would. \\n The water was gaining fast, but Chestnut was faster. The trees lining the path to the town stretched like talons as they whipped past her. THE MAN did not think to bring reins, but it had not mattered then and did not matter now; he threw his arms around her neck and held on, still struggling to see where she was taking him. It looked like the town entrance from the shadows. It looked like the world outside, and then- \\n -It looked like the other side of town. \\n Chestnut slammed her front feet into the water and screamed backwards at the heat. She couldn’t see, but THE MAN could, and what he saw was an endless lake, a boiling fathom of water they could not see the reaches of through the inky black of the storm. He pulled up on her mane and brought her backwards, stunned, reeling- had they made it? Was the world outside gone? Were they really back inside- \\n (the world was filled with screaming on the other, more populated side of town) \\n -the boiling pit? \\n Chestnut followed his grip, but her gait was slumping quickly. They didn’t backtrack so much as they tripped backwards down the quickly diminishing unsubmerged track of road to the exit, or the entrance, and then they were back by the barn- he could see it through the trees as lightning flashed.\\nThe water was gaining. He could not see. They were at the entrance of town and water fell down the path from the other side, now, boiling and rippling until he was making Chestnut dance on a few yards of precarious dark path like a tortured circus creature, thrashed by red tides, played with by a storm-laden marionette. Smaller and smaller became the space and harder the storm raged, the rain dissipating into steam before hitting the surface like some kind of warped lava of improbability- shouldn’t it all be steam by now? Why was it still expanding? How long had they been on their little island of torture, and how long had they danced? Seconds? Minutes? Hours? \\n (Chestnut had never felt such pain) \\n She fell. He fell. Like frogs in a boiling pot, it took far longer than was merciful. \\n The doctor doesn’t come, and Francis vaguely wonders why- he does not hear the flood from the lake shattering the flower shop’s windows in a sea of boiling blood and flesh on the ground floor- but it ultimately does not matter, because the baby comes in less than an hour and suddenly there is three of them in the room: Lilly, Francis, and the little baby girl. \\n Francis didn’t know there was any love left in his body to give, but his baby girl is heavier than he expected, warmer, more alive and lovable then he ever could know. He wraps her in linens from down the hall and holds her while Lilly doses. When he touches the palm of her tiny hand, her little fingers wrap around his own, and Francis is suddenly more fiercely protective then he ever thought he could be. He hadn’t felt love like this in years. It makes him want to cry. \\n Meri. \\n Lilly had chosen the name, because Lilly chose everything. She told him that they had discussed it, but Francis knew that they hadn’t truly discussed anything since he’d come home from the GOC full time. Just another lie that he hadn’t challenged. It wasn’t worth it. It never was. But he thought it would do, and it was growing on him: Meri, like something written in a forgotten Latin script. \\n In his muddled mess of emotions Francis can’t help but picture a situation where this works out. Lilly goes back to her old self, the way she was when he loved her. They don’t use their powers anymore. They live here, in the house with the little backyard and the lake. They’d make ends meet because with Lilly working downstairs they wouldn’t need to pay for daycare, and he would probably have to go off for a while, back on the road with the GOC under his old codename with his old team, but he’d send the money home and it would all be worth it for the two of them. He’s suddenly calling up numbers that he hasn’t thought about in months: £1,000 for a class 4 Type Green if he can get it under a week. £500 if he can get it under a month. Up to £5,000 for a high stakes hunt. Less if he hunted with the team- the earnings would be split between them- but he had something to come home for now, and something to live for. He was good at being an agent, and he would get better and the stakes would get higher and he would have to hunt alone, eventually- would have to go undercover or something and really put everything he could on the line- but those missions could pay best of all. And if he earned enough he could come home and see his little girl, spend a month living as a normal person in a normal town with his gun and walkie talkie stowed away. And if Meri was a Type Green, too- like both her parents were- well. They would make it work. She would be okay. There would be Christmases and birthdays and all this mess between he and Lilly would heal up and everything might be just fine after all and they’d never talk about it again. Water under the bridge, little family unit. Ice cream in the summer. Swimming in the lake. \\n It could work out thought Francis, imagining a future where the rifle he’d slid under their bed for this moment was instead tucked away in the closet by the stairs where he kept it while off duty, leaned against the back corner with the umbrellas like a prop in a gallows humor silent film. He’d waited in the kitchen until Lilly had a customer in the flower shop downstairs before going to get it, and that had been a week ago now. Was he still sure that this was what he needed to do? Kill the mother of his child? Why? For vengeance? Because she was too far gone and had been for far too long? He didn’t feel angry in the way he saw men murdering their wives on TV. \\n It wouldn’t work out, thinks Francis next. The next step after this was marriage, and some deep part of him- some primal corner of his subconscious who knew how this would have to end- knew that he could not do this much longer. Meri would not fix Lilly, because nothing could fix Lilly. It was the same chain of events that he’d seen in all the Type Greens he’d killed in the GOC, and he’d never questioned those diagnoses, made by someone else behind a computer screen hundreds of miles away. \\n Yes, it was now or never. Now, or she wouldn’t stop for the next eighteen years, and when Meri moved out she would finally manage to kill him, if he didn’t manage to do it first. Leaving was out of the question- who knew what she would do in her condition? What if she went on some kind of rampage- \\n (Francis does not hear the boiling water lapping the lowest step now, the baseboards around the cashier counter, trickling down the steps to the basement where he has not stepped foot for months upon months. they have been screaming upward and francis has been screaming downward. a missed connection. a dash of fate) \\n -or killed their little girl, or killed someone else- \\n (the GOC has been surrounding the outskirts of the town for weeks and at night they go marching in to the home where francis sleeps that they call things like ‘den’ and ‘lair’. from the apartment lilly does not allow him to leave he sees the same repeat of a clear fathomless sky with the lake below from the window in the bedroom and all is alright in his world, he has been so naive, him, with all his experience with type greens, with being one himself, how could he have let this happen she has killed forty-eight people by the time the cornwall incident properly begins and no one knows, inside or outside, exactly how she did it or exactly where they went-) \\n -no, he needed to do this. For himself. For his little girl. \\n For Lilly, to end her suffering. \\n So here he is as the boiling water rises at the first day of the rest of his life. His girlfriend and best friend of as long as he can remember is lying in bed and she’s beautiful and terrible, a blade contorted to cut the thin flesh of reality with the precision of a surgeon’s scalpel. The way she calls to him catches him off-guard in its softness, it’s love, Francis, can I see her? and he smiles and sits on his side of the bed and she’s laying on her side of the bed and for a moment, he sees every reason he ever loved her, laid before him like a cartographer’s map. Here is the point where you became the frog, it says, and here is the point where she boiled the water. Here is the solar plexus of your desire. Here is your nadir in her eyes, in the way she lies so evenly to you, made you think you were the one spiraling into the grips of a class 4 condition. She’s built this house like she’s built her rituals, and she’s built her rituals like she’s reconstructed you- patched and reeling in endless contempt, an animal entwining itself only further, as sure as the water rises and boils for an old and hungry god. \\n \\n@\\n@\\n@ \\n “I love you,” says Francis. \\n “Touch me,” says Lilly. \\n \\n@\\n@\\n@ \\n The lake is red. It fills the streets of North Access and it floods all the forests, the little creeks and streams. It seeks out the hiding. It drags out the weakened. It boils anything in its path with the righteousness of the lord- \\n -and Francis touches her, first passing off the baby into her arms, then taking either sides of her face in his hands. \\n “I love you,” he repeats. He doesn’t know why he loves her still, after everything she’s done to him. Shouldn’t he hate her? Why doesn’t he hate her? \\n Because you would rather be treated like shit then risk being alone, says a voice deep inside him, and all at once he longs for the other life, the one where she’s magically repaired. He repeats it like a prayer in his mind, i-would-make-ends-meet-somehow-and-i-would-protect-you-and-meri-somehow-and-i-would-love-you-somehow-right-up-until-i-couldnt-anymore-whenever-or-wherever-that-would-be-i-would-find-a-way-to-believe-you-were-loving-me-and-treating-me-right-and-i-would-just-keep-letting-things-go-and-being-tired-and-not-knowing-why-and-having-you-tell-me-how-worthless-i-am-and-waiting-for-the-day-you-want-sex-again-and-again-i-cant-stop-you-from-it-because-i-freeze-with-terror-and-i-would-still-love-you-for-meri-and-for-that-life-and-for-who-you-used-to-be-no-matter-if-it-takes-ten-years-or-twenty-years-or-for-the-rest-of-my-life-there-has-to-be-a-way-i-could-keep-pretending-forever- \\n She turns away, abruptly, towards the door and suddenly the moment is here, because she is distracted by the water beginning to pool under the door to their bedroom, the water billowing steam.\\n“Francis?” she says without moving his head, and he takes his hands away and soundlessly draws on some lifesaving pool of GOC solider within him to go for the gun, under the bed, and he almost misses it, “There’s something I need to tell you-” \\n But she doesn’t end up telling him, because in another few seconds she’s dead and Francis takes the baby and runs from the water. He bursts out of the bedroom to find it ankle deep on the top floor of their home, searing into his flesh like a hot knife. The entire town doesn’t rest in a crater- how the hell was the water going upwards? Meri is screaming from the sound of the gunshot and Francis is so shocked into silence, between the scalding of his own flesh and killing his best friend in the world and the fact that the water has submerged everything but the hallway to his left, and there is no way to go at first and then suddenly, there is. \\n Francis does not register much of the next 80 hours. He doesn’t think that he’s ever run for so long in his life. Up the stairs at the end of the hallway and he’s next to the closest door with the umbrellas with the silent film black comedy gun and he’s running past the bathroom where he used to wake up and go to vomit in the nights after Meri was conceived, and he’s running past the kitchen where she would sit and tell him what shit he was, and he’s running past the bedroom where her body is laid out dead on the bed and past the empty nursery and up another flight of stairs and he’s at the umbrella cabinet again and up and up and up and the water kept rising and the baby was heavy in his arms but stopped crying eventually and every once in a while the bedroom door is closed or something big and obscured is writhing in the tub and Francis does not stop, does not look to see if the flood is coming, does not halt even for the men chasing him in armored gear. He runs from an old and all-encompassing god in the lake below that he’s been chained to in a ritual that has not been attempted for a thousand years. He runs from something that he cannot place- his own fear, or from the house? From Lilly? From the men in black armor? From North Access? Does he think that if he runs far enough and fast enough that he will no longer surface back where he started? Is he running from an old sort of concept, a spirit of a flood and of endless passageways that will now prose him for the remainder of his life: \\n Montauk? Was that what he was afraid of, even if he could not place it? Even when he runs the same track endlessly in his dreams? Montauk, as it’s written in the old texts. The pressuring fear. The hand of the red god. \\n He runs until the gas bombs they throw up the stairs make him too tired to continue, and just like that it’s over. \\n On 12/01/1989, investigators began a heavy series of questioning on SCP-4231-B regarding the specifics of the Montauk Procedure- which he had endured several months prior- and on the nature of his sexual molestation and abuse at the hands of SCP-4231-A. Upon beginning the operation, SCP-4231-B proceeded to remove his shoes and socks, as well as a small container of nail polish. He then began to silently apply the nail polish (“Beach Pink” coloration) to his toe and finger nails. After 45 minutes of continuous painting, Agent Youlen was given permission by oversight to remove the paint from the vicinity of SCP-4231-B, as to better proceed with questioning. Questioning resumed 2 minutes later. SCP-4231-B allowed his finger and toenails to dry for approximately 10 minutes, during which he did not speak to investigators. After 10 minutes, SCP-4231-B removed a second bottle of nail polish from his left shoe (“Gecko Green” coloration) and began a second coat of paint. This cycle of confiscation and reappearance of alternative bottles of polish continued for 5 hours, at which point testing was abandoned. SCP-4231-B answered no questions in that time. \\n On 3/23/1990, investigators began a heavy series of questioning on SCP-4231-B regarding the specifics of the Montauk Procedure, and on the nature of his sexual molestation and abuse at the hands of SCP-4231-A. SCP-4231-B, upon sitting down at the interrogation table, began to immediately remove copious amounts of false eyelashes from his pants pockets. Contrary to the expectations of the investigators, SCP-4231-B began to adhere the eyelashes to his wrists in an overlapping, circular fashion, while avoiding all questioning. Test abandoned after three hours, in which time SCP-4231-B had attached 548 pairs of false eyelashes on his arms. At the conclusion of the test, SCP-4231-B uttered his only response to investigators: \\n Agent Youlen: What the fuck are you… \\n SCP-4231-B: Making my arms fuzzy. \\n On 2/14/1991, investigators began the annual questioning of SCP-4231-B regarding the specifics of the Montauk Procedure, and on the nature of his sexual molestation and abuse at the hands of SCP-4231-A. Midway through the questioning, after producing no answers thus far, SCP-4231-B produced a single microscope slide. SCP-4231-B produced no further responses to questioning for the reminder of the session. \\n The microscope slide produced by SCP-4231-B became the subject of an extensive 4-month long investigation by the SCP-4231, SCP-231, and SCP-2317 containment engineering teams. After light microscopy, chemical and physical evaluation, and attempts to match the object to sections of the Erikesh Codex failed, electron microscopy was utilized to search the slide for further features. The object was revealed to be an entirely blank microscope slide with no abnormal properties. \\n As of 03/21/2017, none of the exactly 28 annual questionings of SCP-4231-B regarding his sexual abuse and the Montauk procedure have proved to yield any additional information, although the interrogation procedure continues annually. See document SCP-4231-B-1 for full account of all questionings. \\n In the May of 1990, Foundation psychologists determined that SCP-4231-B’s psychological symptoms worsened significantly in continued containment, and submitted a request that SCP-4231-B be able to work and live as a Foundation employee, utilizing his extensive field experience as a GOC agent to aid the budding Type Green evaluation program. Despite remaining reclusive and defiant regarding his health and his life in North Access, SCP-4231-B was regarded to be a low-risk and relatively stable individual capable of light work. He was granted permission as well as access to University courses in late 1990. \\n SCP-4231’s modern containment procedures consist of monitoring, yearly questioning, and required submission to tests regarding the ongoing state of his abilities. SCP status has remained intact, although removal of this in lieu of a Person of Interest (PoI) classification has been considered in recent years to coincide with SCP-4231-B’s ongoing routine of relatively normal everyday life with little anomalous effect, save for continued PTSD symptoms during sleeping hours and dissociative symptoms typical of trauma, both of which are lessened in a less Foundation-involved environment. \\n SCP-4231-B will have been serving the Foundation for 30 years as of 2020. \\n Leopold, Cornwall, Twelve miles from North Access, July 3rd, 2016 \\n Dusk fell, and as they had since Monday night, the old men watched intently. \\n The Green was an old bar on the main street of Leopold. It hadn’t changed since the 70s, and the men damn well liked things that didn’t change. There was the old stool so and so had a stroke on, over here, the knife gouges in the counter where some long and convoluted back and forth had ended ironically anticlimactically; there had been a roar of disapproval when they’d tried to add a Wi-Fi router for the younger clientele, a partial riot when they removed an old painting with dart holes in it. \\n The men of Leopold- at least those who hadn’t moved on since retirement, moved on or passed on, gone to London to live in a home or decided to spend their final years abroad- were farmers and ranchers from just outside that refused to leave, and preferred to have everything just as it were while they were at it. There were four of them this night in particular, and they wouldn’t have stayed so late if there didn’t appear to be change coming on the horizon for them to watch and complain about at the diner several doors down in the morning. The owner of the bar and its keeper- Dan was his name, a fat man of nearly seventy who’d run this bar just as his father had- occasionally leaned over the counter to see out the front window, where the other three were sitting silently, beers between them, waiting. \\n “Anything yet?” He called as grey light filtered through the old brick buildings, petering out to the highway beyond. He received a chorus of ‘no’s and ‘not yet’s in return. \\n “Oh, we’ll tell you when they come, Danny!” yelled Christopher. 80 years old and counting, Christopher was always loud. They’d been told he’d been hit in the head by a horse when he was young- that it’d struck him half deaf by age 8- but they’d never been able to tell if he was serious. \\n “Yes, we’ll tell you,” said Arthur, significantly softer. He was the youngest of them, at 53, and still worked the farm where he kept his cows and horses. He hadn’t bothered to change his overalls for this. He thought it too exciting. Part of Arthur wondered if he was getting old, indeed, if this was as exciting as his life got nowadays. \\n Dan disappeared back into the kitchen. Peter drank long and slow, thoughtfully, watching the cracked road. He was a tall, thin man with large circular glasses the thickness of pencil lead who had been the schoolteacher at the local preschool for nearly thirty-five years now. Peter gave the impression that he was here not to watch things change, but because he had seen something disturbingly unordinary in what was happening just south of Leopold. Maybe he had even anticipated it. \\n “They’re coming,” said Peter, putting his beer down on the table with a soft thunk. \\n “No they aren’t. Don’t get our hopes up, Pete,” said Christopher. “Look down the road. There ain’t no one coming yet.” \\n “It’s 10\\xa0o’clock,” considered Arthur. “When did they come last night?” \\n “Must have been around eleven,” scoffed Christopher, “I mustav been three beers in when they came last night, couldn’t have been-” \\n Peter put up his index finger. The two stopped talking. \\n “Look,” he said, transfixed. “They’re here.” \\n The three looked down the road, and saw the first truck on the horizon. \\n The vehicle was so astounding because it seemed so new. Shining and unmarked, navy blue in color. This one was a flatbed semi, barely fitting in the left lane of main street with its brights on; the cargo was covered with tan tarp and cord, but when it bounced on the old pothole in front of the bar Peter squinted behind his glasses and could see the steel girders it held underneath. Ten or twelve, he estimated. \\n “Beams,” echoed Arthur, lowering his head to look underneath. “Didn’t they bring in beams yesterday?” \\n “You need quite a lot of beams to build a factory, I would imagine,” drawled Christopher, “Remember when they made the corn syrup plant over in Lenning? Christ, I’d never seen so much steel in my life- Oy, Danny! They’re here!” He bellowed into the kitchen. \\n “What?” bellowed Dan back from the kitchen. “What did you say? They’re here already?” \\n “Yes! Yes! Come look!” cried Arthur. Peter tuned them out, hands thoughtfully rolling the cool bottle between his palms. They were here indeed. \\n Dan came bumbling out of the kitchen with a bottle of whisky, and took the seat at the end of the table, facing towards the window. Arthur and Christopher began to fill them in, reveling in their shared horror of the situation as if the truck itself had somehow besmirched their home. \\n “Beams! More beams! You should have seen them,” cried Christopher. “God, how many beams do you suppose they need?” \\n More headlights flashed at the top of the hill. This one was a pickup truck, again new, again unmarked. White this time. The four of them squinted in unison to attempt to see into the back windows, only to find them tinted away from the light of the bar. They mumbled their discontent. The next one was a van of the same condition, and the next, a semi-trailer. By the time the next flatbed truck came over the pothole- this time with two coils of electrical wiring loaded on the back- the four had started discussing again about what they supposed to be doing. \\n “A glue factory,” said Arthur in disbelief. “In North Access. Nobody’s been to North Access in thirty years, and they suddenly decide to build a glue factory there?” \\n “I’m telling you, they got bought out,” said Christopher, “Some company saw the property and bought it off the government.” \\n “You can’t buy land off the government, Chrissy! It doesn’t work that way.” cried Arthur. “North Access wasn’t even for sale. We would have known if it had been for sale.” \\n “You all are missing the point. A man doesn’t buy out an entire ghost town for one factory. And where do you suppose the workers are gonna live?” \\n “Not in North Access, that’s for sure,” said Christopher. “You suppose they know about the flooding?” \\n “It wasn’t flooding,” interrupted Dan. “They lied to us. It damn well wasn’t flooding at all.” \\n “Dan’s right, Chrissy. It was a fire that took it out, don’t you remember?” said Arthur. Christopher tutted and shook his head. \\n “Pete saw what happened, didn’t you Pete?” \\n And Peter had seen. \\n Peter’s mother had thought there was always something about him. She was one of the believers of the veil children born with special powers, believed him to be sensitive in a way she was not. In reality, Peter had been more than just sensitive- but he had not known that until several years after his mother had died, when the teenager with the gun had come to the entrance of Leopold’s brightly-colored preschool and thrown in the door. \\n But that was another story. And Cornwall had happened after that. \\n Peter had left work in the late July of 1989 with a feeling not unlike the feeling he had had not twenty minutes before the figure with the gun came, and when he arrived at home he had wandered at first, wandered like a dog disturbed by a storm. There was no definitive emotion behind it- should he hide? He wasn’t afraid, per say. Antsy. Waiting for a message? \\n And then, suddenly- Peter had been pulled. \\n It was exciting. Peter had never been religious, but the sensation was akin to seeing another on an empty tundra where one has lived alone all one’s life. It was like seeing a gleaming city, or sensing it was close. He remembered the wise men his mother had insisted he learn about, the stories he never believed. He remembered the star. \\n Something is happening, thought Peter. \\n And so he’d driven in the direction of North Access and the warmth had grown. And he’d driven closer to it and the warmth felt hot. And he’s gotten a mile away and the heat was scalding, and he pulled off the road and stumbled out in a white terror to find a sight he could not conceive to others. What was reality in this instance, in the space ahead of him, at the beginning of the trees? Drops of oil spitting from a hot pan on a stove- was this what he was witnessing, if not from half a mile away? How could he explain that a space in the world was boiling when only his third eye could see the tumultuous damage of an overflowing tide, a sinkhole which had been there for millennia caving inwards towards a molten river of rock and bone before him as the superficial fabric of trees and grass stayed intact like a mocking mirage- \\n “I didn’t see anything,” says Peter. \\n Another truck passes the bar, and Peter ends his statement with a sip of his drink. \\n They were building. He wasn’t sure who they were, or what they were doing, or if they could see or even perceive the desolate smoldering crater in reality that had been left behind where North Access, Cornwall used to stand. But Peter was watching. And he was afraid. \\n If you had told Robert Scranton forty years ago that his father was right in his assumptions about how to stabilize reality, and that he’d been on the right track to building a device that could do it successfully at will, he probably wouldn’t have believed you. His father- Arnold Scranton- had raised him up to take his own role at the Foundation when he died, and as Arnie had gotten older and more senile Robert had more and more doubts about exactly what the hell he was planning to do. Old obscure texts tended to be unreliable- and old obscure texts in strange old languages bought off a MC&D auction house tended to be very unreliable. The only way his dad had been able to read it at all was because he’d gotten an old witch with some grasp of the old magics to translate it. \\n Of course, that had all been before Robert had been born. If he’d had a say in exactly what primary sources his father was pulling his engineering tips from, he would have pointed towards something a little more well established. Maybe just asked him to pull out of the industry all together. In fact, the auto industry had been Rob’s personal backup plan in the case that his dad really had been crazy; he, for one, hadn’t gotten an engineering degree to fumble around with old ritual magic. Not that anyone outside Rob’s personal group of engineers needed to know about that portion of the project. \\n But now, here he was. And it was 2016, and O5 had decided to build a factory. \\n A factory. Now that had been a surprise for Robert Scranton, but after several decades of the Foundation becoming more and more reliant on Scranton Reality Anchors for everything from containment to task force operations, the world suddenly had a need. It wouldn’t be a large factory- just enough space to devote completely to building them, a specific workshop for Robert and his exactly 24 containment engineer staffers. The spot O5 had picked would need a few anchors all of its own, but it was already inert area on a containment site- a little out of the way, positioned over an old horse barn they’d demolished. They had a cover story and everything. It was glorious. \\n The only thing keeping them from a completely smooth transition from a lab in Site-88 to a full devoted operation in Cornwall was the issue of supply- what they would need for the rituals. And Robert had made it very clear to O5 exactly what he was talking about when he said supply. They had assured him that where there was demand, there would be supply; they had said that the world had followed the Foundation’s lead in developing reality anchors, and had provided him with a hefty account to pay for what they needed. Robert wasn’t sure exactly what they were hoping he and his team would do with the money- were they hoping that they would do the whole thing, source their own supply? Because that was certainly not Robert’s business at all. Up until now, they’d just used old supply from the 80s, but that was running out fast. \\n But that was all fine. They would figure it out, he was sure. Everything was going very smoothly for him- and he was about to ride it as far as it would go, at least until the factory was completed. \\n April 4th, 2016. 1000 hours. Undisclosed Facility in Newcastle, England. \\n Here is D.C. al Fine before them as they sit in the archives, surrounded by old wooden bookshelves extending to the skylight above. The skylight is rigged with laser beams, Coda knew. If you looked closely at the shadows being cast across the carpeted floor to the criss cross of files bound in human flesh and charred records from GOC agents long past, one could even see their thin ghosts inching across the room. It really does break the ruse, Coda thinks; makes you remember that just outside the door was a maze of steel hallways, control rooms, and far enough below them a hospital of injured and dying agents. A Foundation operative in this room would be able to tell the entire scheme in half a second just by looking at the iron bolts half-hidden at the northern baseboards. \\n A normal person would be heavily distracted by the constant buzz of radio chatter from around the world blaring in their ear at all times, but Coda has been doing this job for so long it barely phases them. Sitting in the room, the two bathed in light, their respective jobs are easily revealed; D.C. in a brown tailored suit stirring sugar into his tea, and Coda in a gender ambiguous sweater and jeans, pale and haggard, raising the microphone on their headset away from their mouth in order to drink their own. Close, but not too close; two machines miraculously running in perfect parallel. Violin bows suspended in a symphony. Faint laser beam shadows in a dusty room. \\n D.C. is troubled, and Coda is unable to pin down exactly what it is that’s bothering him. Coda notes the little signs on his face that show he’s lost rest recently with the vague interest of an old dog watching its master. They take their tea black and bitter from a steel pot to the left of the table, taking a sip while listening to an agent in France getting blown off their motorcycle by a miraculously materializing pipe bomb. The resulting cacophony is audible from Coda’s headset to where D.C. is sitting. He tries not to take notice to it, but can’t help but wince at the distressed intonations that follow- the words are muddled and in a variety of languages, but having been an agent in the field himself for many years he knows exactly what they’re saying and dreads the sound. Coda pauses picking at a stray thread on their sweater sleeve to turn down the volume once they see his mild reaction. It was a somewhat friendly gesture, but D.C. can’t help but imagine the agent laying dazed and dying in the middle of a French freeway, oblivious that there were two people aware of their plight calmly having tea several thousand miles away. \\n Coda clears their throat. “Paris has it,” they say, as though it could keep the agent from getting hit and killed by a minivan in the impending few minutes. D.C. nods. He can hear the faint monotonous rattle of the Paris dispatcher cutting through the chaos whispering out of Coda’s headset. A hopeful part of him imagines that there’s something that can be done, but he knows the agent’s chances of survival dwindle with the number of highway lanes. \\n “What a world we live in,” He remarks, “What a world, Coda.” \\n It’s Coda’s turn to nod. They sigh, shift slightly in the old mahogany chair. \\n “Indeed,” they respond, just to humor him. \\n There are birds making a nest on the side of the skylight. D.C. tries to focus on the two featherless robins to take his attention from the ensuing chaos of Coda’s everyday existence. Coda looks at them too, and wonders if the security beams would get them before they could fly away. They were getting bored, but knew better than to rush D.C.’s commentary when he called these meetings; sometimes, D.C. wouldn’t get around to talking about anything at all, and they would just sit in silence listening to the clock on the mantle ticking their lunch breaks away. Coda always thought those were especially boring, and tended to turn their attention to the endless dilemmas in their earpiece more for entertainment than for anything else. \\n D.C. puts his tea down on the saucer. \\n “I’m going to run an idea past you,” he says, “And I need you to hear me out all the way before you tell me ‘no’.” \\n Coda raises an eyebrow. While D.C. had been watching the laser beam birds the Paris team had been trying to drag the agent off the road at the height of rush hour traffic, but the new proposition was intriguing enough to pull the younger officer’s attention back to the events of the dusty library.\\nD.C. takes a breath. \\n “I was thinking about relaunching the Ichabod campaign,” He says. \\n “Hm. No,” says Coda, going for another sip of tea. \\n “If it’s the Cornwall Incident you’re worried about-,” \\n “Incident,” They test the word in an academic half-sneer, probing, “You know, that’s always irritated me, the word incident. 1,200 people boiled alive isn’t an incident. 1,200 people boiled alive is a massacre. They say that being burned to death is the most painful thing the human body can endure, but I’ve looked and there’s no statistics on boiling in the modern era. It’s like nobody even thinks that you could do that to a person, forget over a thousand people. All the records on boiling someone to death come from the middle ages. The kind of thing you’d do to a prisoner, for humiliation.” \\n “Let me finish, Coda,” he says with striking regularity in his tone, but Coda sets the cup back down on the oak table and continues, thoughtfully- \\n “You know, the sound of people boiling-” they pause, considering, “-you know, drowning is a relatively quiet thing to have happen. People who are drowning don’t usually use the precious time they have when they come up from under the water to scream, so lifeguards generally learn to spot the body language instead of relying on auditory cues. Now the sound of people burning is very different. Obviously, when you’re burning at the stake, you’re going to be awfully vocal about it-” \\n “-Coda-” \\n “Do you want a second Cornwall?” says Coda evenly, without a hint of irritation in their tone. “Because if you want a second Cornwall, then by all means. I’ll put the Foundation clean-up crews on speed dial.” \\n Coda does not register that they have crossed a line at first, but it dawns on them as the room seems to tighten, bringing the laser beams and their cutting shadows ever so closer to the point where they feel themselves writhing under Fine’s gaze. He puts his tea down and for a moment. There is dust and particulate in the air. They wonder where it came from. It was a facade, all of this- the GOC was neither old nor wise, had no libraries or archives to hold dust of any kind in sunbeams, nor dust, nor ash, nor steam- \\n “If you do your job right,” D.C. al Fine says, “There won’t be a second Cornwall.” \\n The agent in France dies in Coda’s headset. What a world it is, indeed. \\n “Tell me the truth,” She says. \\n They have been at this for an hour and a half and Francis Wojciechoski is writhing on the bathroom floor in front of her, sobbing. He isn’t sure how he got to this point and he isn’t sure if he’ll live past it. It is one of many nights like this but tonight she asks him, for the millionth time- \\n “Tell me the truth!” She’s blocking the door. He’s afraid of what she’ll do but he’s so tired, so fucking tired and he’s bleeding again, that’s how all this started was that he’d woken up bleeding again- \\n “I don’t know the truth, Lilly!” Francis screams and his voice cracks. She is the monster with teeth again. She is the antler predator, and he is afraid. The truth he had given had been the wrong truth, and in another life when he lays safe and sound in a bed in a Siberian training camp hundreds of thousands of miles away from North Access he will wonder if she pretended not to know because she was horrified of what she had done to him. Had she done it because she knew what was happening to her- that it was her, not him, who had been in a slow and painful decline into class 4, to maintain that denial? Had she done it to terrorize him? Had she wanted to hurt him at all, or was she doing it to herself? Was he a byproduct of her implosion? Why did she deny it…and why did she do it to him at all? \\n There is terror in her eyes. He wishes that it was self-awareness. He isn’t sure of that now. \\n “You’re a liar,” she hisses. \\n “I don’t know what you want me to say!” Francis erupts, because he’s never been more frustrated and scared before in his life and he never will be again. He screeches with his last shred of dignity and his last shred of self-worth, his last sense of being as the person he is and has been- \\n “I AM NOT A LIAR! I HAVE NEVER LIED TO YOU, YOU CAN’T JUST MAKE SHIT UP ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED!” \\n And then he sobs. And the bathroom is quiet. And Lilly is quiet. \\n And then she says quietly, like he hears it in his dreams and in his nightmares, whispered around dark corners of his home, fleeting in the shadows, a dark doubt that lurks in his subconscious and haunts him in its most potent form, now and forever: \\n (sure as the water rises in the tide; sure as turbulence on an airplane leaving tucson, arizona in 1995) \\n “Tell me the truth-” \\n Inhale, exhale. Easy does it. Alto Clef, lightheaded and breathing heavily from the nightmare, rests his head between his knees to avoid passing out as the raw horror begins to leave his body.\\nIt takes a few minutes, but he comes back around a little, although his chest still hurts from the panic. He was getting too damn old for this shit. Maybe the next one would kill him off, he thinks bitterly. It was just plain stupid at this point- he was 30 years out from that now. He told himself he was over it; he had a new name, a new job, and most importantly nobody knew. Or at least, if anybody did know, nobody had come up and asked him about it, which had always been his worst fear in that regard. \\n He was safe. And when he was awake, he knew that he was safe. This was a Foundation training camp in Siberia, and he lived in the building in the heart of it; if anyone came in unannounced they would know in an instant. The main site was less than a mile away. They had enough artillery between the two areas to bring the whole damn place down if they needed to, and as for emotional damage, the fear of being abused like that again- well, he never let anyone get close enough to try. \\n So things were good. No, they were great, actually. Alto thought they really couldn’t be better. Sure, the PTSD was exhausting, and the Foundation beating a dead horse by giving him annual tests and interviews; he could do without both of those. But Cornwall? That was a long time ago now. \\n Yes, thinks Alto Clef as he presses ‘play’ on Animal House, placed presently on his laptop for these exact nights where things were his subconscious wasn’t getting the memo; Cornwall couldn’t be farther behind him. And he was safe. \\n And things were good. \\n Foundation registered reality anchor #4,345 wasn’t sure quite when it woke up. It was hard for it to tell the time. Nearly impossible, actually. \\n It could tell that it was floating in a line next to a few other reality anchors- it could feel them, hovering slightly in the distance just out of reach. #4,345 wondered if they were awake, too, and if they were awake if they remembered anything about how they got here and what they were doing aside from keeping everything stable. How long had it been there, anyway? What had it been before now- in the dark primordial ooze of reality it could feel rushing past its third eye? \\n As time passed, #4,345 began to remember a few things about what it used to be. It hadn’t always been here, floating gently between the water roughly 5 meters off the ocean floor and the fourth dimensional Hume space that encompassed it. Sometimes #4,345 even felt as if it had once been part of something much bigger than the space that it knew. It didn’t have the ability to think very much, and only considered these questions once or twice a month before getting tired and going back to drifting on its chain as it always did- but after a few years it had been able to push and pull free a single memory. \\n It remembered a house. \\n \\n@\\n@\\n@ \\n \\n@\\n@\\n@ \\n « SCP-4230 | SCP-4231 | SCP-4232 »\"', 'SCP-4269': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-4269 \\n An instance of SCP-4269. \\n Item #: SCP-4269 \\n Object Class: Safe \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-4269 instances are to be contained in a standard anomalous item locker.

Any subject who wears an instance of SCP-4269 is known as an instance of SCP-4269-1. Subjects who view SCP-4269-1 instances will perceive them as a person they would consider their ideal standard of sexual attractiveness. This anomalous effect extends to all senses, including touch, taste and smell. \\n Different subjects may see different people when viewing and interacting with an SCP-4269-1 instance, and one subject may view multiple different people if viewing more than one SCP-4269-1 instance. The only known restriction of SCP-4269\\'s cognitohazardous effects is it will not alter an SCP-4269-1 instance\\'s gender to the subject viewing it. \\n Below is an abridged list of SCP-4269-1 instances as viewed by Foundation Personnel: \\n Incident 4269-03: On September 28th, 19██, Researcher Wendy Flanders had reportedly requested an instance of SCP-4269 for experimentation purposes, but had not returned it for several days. \\n The following are several tests made by Researcher Flanders that were discovered on her personal computer: \\n Beyond the testing, investigation of Researcher Flanders had revealed that she had kept the SCP-4269 instance for several days after concluding her tests, and had placed it on the base of a lamp in her office along with other pieces of lingerie and a silicone phallus. \\n Researcher Flanders has been severely reprimanded, including removal as Head Researcher on the SCP-4269 project, and prohibition of working with any humanoid SCP Objects. \\n Researcher Fiona Mariah has since requested to be transferred to a different Foundation Site after the events of Incident 4269-03.

Due to a history of cooperation with the Foundation, SCP-4960 has been granted Level 2 Privileges, although contact with non-cleared personnel is forbidden. \\n In order to maintain the efficacy of Procedure 166-Anahita, the Foundation has commissioned several artists (including an animation studio) to produce graven images1 for Procedure 166-Anahita. As the continued efficacy of Procedure 166-Anahita requires a constant influx of new graven images, a special account has been established to fund these works through several sockpuppet accounts on multiple popular e-commerce and art gallery websites. This account is refreshed every two weeks by the fiscal calendar. Contact ████ █████████ in the Financial Services department if additional funds become necessary. \\n Description: SCP-4960 is a physical manifestation of Kedesh-Nanaya, a Bronze Age sex and fertility goddess of beauty, carnal pleasure, and erotic femininity. SCP-4960 manifests as a buxom woman of average height and curvaceous build, with ample breasts, firm buttocks, and shapely legs. Her skin tone is coppery and without blemish, save for a small beauty mark on her upper lip. Her sleek, black hair falls to below her hips, and shimmers blue-black like a raven\\'s wing. SCP-4960 generally prefers to go nude in her chambers, although she is fond of wearing finely wrought gold jewelry and diaphanous robes cut to emphasize her voluptuous figure.2 \\n SCP-4960 gains sustenance from the act of worship described in Document 166-Anahita (designated Procedure 166-Anahita). The number of daily acts of worship required to maintain SCP-4960\\'s current level of wakefulness varies based on the devotion of the worshipper and quality of the act of worship. Should the number of daily acts of worship fall under a critical threshold for a prolonged period of time, SCP-4960 will fall into a torpor state until the completion of a sufficient number of acts of worship. \\n As SCP-4960 has provided (and continues to provide) vital insights into ancient Bronze Age cultures, languages, and occult practices that have proven vital to the operation of the Foundation, her continued wakefulness is considered important to Foundation operations. All reasonable efforts are to be made to provide her with the sustenance she requires, up to and including the performance of Procedure 166-Anahita by Foundation personnel. \\n Addendum 1 - Circumstances of Retrieval: Site SC-93 was initially discovered in 1917 during the Hijazi uprising against the Turkish occupation in what is now modern-day Syria. Following the end of World War I and the subsequent establishment of French control over the region in 1920, an expedition was funded by the English philanthropist Lord J. P. Marshall to explore the dig site and catalog the artifacts contained within. British archaeologist F. William Abernathy was chosen as the expedition leader. \\n Chamber SC-9-F was discovered in September of 1921, after a local man hired as water-carrier stumbled upon a stone step leading downwards towards a hidden chamber, concealed under debris and rock chips. Excavation of the staircase revealed a doorway leading to a downwards-sloping corridor that had been blocked with soil, sandstone fragments, and other debris. Excavation of this corridor revealed a second door leading to Chamber SC-9-F. \\n SCP-4960 was discovered in Chamber SC-9-F in a torpor state, surrounded by graven images and other artifacts. The majority of the artifacts found within SCP-4960\\'s shrine were recovered, catalogued, and transferred to secure custody for assessment and translation, although some were lost due to an attack by outside forces.4 Of these artifacts, the item designated Document-166 Anahita proved vital in understanding SCP-4960\\'s sustenance requirements, resulting in the codification of Procedure 166-Anahita. \\n SCP-4960 was first awakened on ██-██-████, following the accidental performance of an act of worship as described in Procedure 166-Anahita. Initial communications proved difficult to establish, requiring the aid of several experts in Bronze Age Levantine languages to establish a shared linguistic affinity. As of ██-██-████, SCP-4960 is fluent in several languages, including modern Greek, Egyptian, Arabic, and Esperanto. \\n Addendum 2 - Document 166-Anahita: Document 166-Anahita is an erotic balbale5 written at some point during the 3rd millenium BC. Originally found inscribed on clay tablets in ancient Sumerian cuneiform, the document describes an act of worship called \"Awakening the Goddess,\" which was the primary act of worship among devotees of Kedesh-Nanaya. A translation of this document is reproduced below. \\n O, Kedesh-Nanaya, worthy daughter of An6, unsurpassed in ladyship, from whose lips flow forth honey and wine: \\n Worthy are you to be worshipped, you who rest your thighs upon a throne of amber.7\\nWorthy are you to be worshipped, you who clad yourself in twilight and mist.\\nWorthy are you to be worshipped, you who decorate yourself in ornaments of gold.\\nWorthy are you to be worshipped, you whose lips separate like rose petals. \\n Let me come into your presence to worship your womanly thighs.\\nLet me come into your presence to seek comfort between your breasts.\\nLet me come into your presence to drink sweet wine from your navel.\\nLet me come into your presence to press my lips against your feet. \\n I kneel before your image, and my eyes see your nakedness.\\nI kneel before your image, and your breasts make my belly awaken.\\nI kneel before your image, and your hips are particularly pleasing.\\nI kneel before your image, and your thighs enflame my lusts. \\n O, Kedesh-Nanaya, worthy daughter of An, unsurpassed in ladyship, from whose lips flow forth honey and wine: \\n You come to me with bread and wine in the hours before dawn,\\nYou come to me as the world sleeps, though I lie awake.\\nYou come to me with milk and honey as I beseech you to draw near.\\nYou come to me, and your patient smile calms my sorrowing heart. \\n As the digger digs his trenches, let me dig your canals.\\nAs the farmer ploughs his furrows, let me plough your fields.\\nAs the water wets the earth, let me wet your furrows.\\nAs beloved dine on milk and wine, let us sup together in your name. \\n I kneel before your image, and my hand becomes your womanhood.8\\nI kneel before your image, and your warmth consumes my warmth.\\nI kneel before your image, and you coax me to come forth.\\nI will never grace a wife or lover: my milk9 is yours alone. \\n O, Kedesh-Nanaya, worthy daughter of An, unsurpassed in ladyship, from whose lips flow forth honey and wine: \\n You who grasp in your hand the naked sword and the tapered axe.10\\nYou who grasp in your hands the snake and the lotus.11\\nYou who shine brightly as the lovely morning star.12\\nCome to me, unworthy as I am, and let your lips meet mine. \\n Addendum 3 - Authorization of Expansion of Procedure 166-Anahita, Dated ██-██-████: Due to the lack of personnel available to perform Procedure 166-Anahita and the loss of efficacy of previous methods of recruiting worshippers, the following course of action has been approved by the Overseer Council: \\n Additional Note: The above-mentioned actions have resulted in a significant number of anonymous acts of worship as described in Procedure 166-Anahita. Although insufficient to maintain full wakefulness, the establishment of this course of action has reduced the burden on Foundation personnel by nearly 15%. \\n Addendum 4 - Further Developments in Procedure 166-Anahita, Dated ██-██-████: Graven images of SCP-4960 have proven unusually popular in the internet art galleries and anonymous imageboards mentioned in Addendum 3. In addition, several non-Foundation associated artists have created their own personal graven images of SCP-4960, which has resulted in a marked increase in SCP-4960\\'s wakefulness. With SCP-4960\\'s cooperation, the Foundation has authorized the creation of a work of interactive fiction to increase awareness of SCP-4960\\'s graven images. \\n Additional Note: Thanks to the above-mentioned actions, compulsory participation by Foundation personnel in Procedure 166-Anahita has been reduced by 75%. \\n Addendum 5 - Continued Expansion of Procedure 166-Anahita, Dated ██-██-████: The Foundation front account established in Addendum 3 was approached by an animation firm located in ████████████, ██████, which expressed interest in the creation of a series of animated films inspired by SCP-4960. After consulting with SCP-4960, it was decided that the Foundation would pursue a partnership with said animation firm, provided that the security of the Foundation\\'s front corporations could be maintained. \\n Additional Note: The above-mentioned actions have resulted in a drastic number of anonymous acts of worship as described in Procedure 166-Anahita, to a level sufficient to maintain the full wakefulness of SCP-4960. Compulsory participation by Foundation personnel in Procedure 166-Anahita is no longer required. \\n Addendum 6 - Note Regarding Demographics of Participants in Procedure 166-Anahita: A brief anonymous survey carried out on █████████████.com from ██-██-████ to ██-██-████ indicates the following: \\n Addendum 7 - Request Regarding Revision of Special Containment Procedures: \\n From: ████████████ █████, Hazardous Materials, Containment, and Logistics\\nTo: Maria Jones, Records and Information Security Administration\\nRe: Revision of Special Containment Procedures of SCP-4960 \\n Maria, \\n For the love of Bob, could someone please, PLEASE revise the fucking Special Containment Procedures for this one? I know that the whole \"horny middle-aged author\" tone was used back in the day when the Foundation had to recruit internally to feed the Goddess, but given that she feeds mostly off of teenagers jerking off to her on the Internet nowadays, do we REALLY need to have that sort of smut fucking up our PROFESSIONAL DATABASE? \\n Sincerely,\\n███ \\n From: Maria Jones, Records and Information Security Administration\\nTo: ████████████ █████, Hazardous Materials, Containment, and Logistics\\nRe: Revision of Special Containment Procedures of SCP-4960 \\n ███, \\n Believe me, I\\'ve asked O5 about this… oh… about once every two months or so for the last few years. Official word is that the Overseers want to maintain a small cadre of \"in-house worshippers\" should her popularity wane to the point where the internet no longer provides enough worshippers to keep her fed and awake. \\n If it bugs you enough, let me forward you a database extension that will redact the more objectionable parts of the Containment Procedures for you, so you can at least do your work without getting distracted. \\n Maria \\n From: ████████████ █████, Hazardous Materials, Containment, and Logistics\\nTo: Maria Jones, Records and Information Security Administration\\nRe: Revision of Special Containment Procedures of SCP-4960 \\n It won\\'t help. I\\'ll know it\\'s still there. \\n Thanks for trying. \\n Section 1: SC-9 Excavation Record\\nSite SC-9 is a ziggurat located in modern-day Syria, ██ km ████ of ██████████13 Upon discovery in 1917, the structure was in an extreme state of disrepair, resulting in the discovery of a second, hidden temple located within its foundation (Chamber SC-9-F). Archaeological evidence indicates that the successor temple was constructed atop the foundations of a previous temple which had fallen into disrepair, and that Chamber SC-9-F was hastily repurposed to house and conceal SCP-4960 for an unknown reason. \\n The chamber itself is 1.75 meters tall, 6.52 meters long, and 4.92 meters wide, roughly oriented with the corners facing in the four cardinal directions. The northwestern and southeastern walls are decorated with paintings depicting scenes from mythology and daily life. The northeastern wall (opposite the entrance) is decorated with a five-panel bas-relief inset with lapis lazuli (Items 158-Anahita through 165-Anahita). A false wall originally concealed most of the chamber from view: this wall was damaged during the excavation, resulting in the discovery of the main chamber. \\n Section 2: Partial Inventory of contents of Chamber SC-9-F \\n Section 2: Gallery of Graven Images Featuring SCP-4960 \\n Excerpts from the Diary of F.

Assigned Carter to purchase supplies and donkeys for expedition. Went on to visit Eberstrom, living in his small house by the river. Had a most excellent dinner with him and spent the night. \\n Tuesday, September 6, 1921\\nReturned to ████████ by boat. Spoke to Carter re: plans for excavation. Compensated local merchant re: insult to fruit stand. \\n Friday, September 9, 1921\\nCommenced operations. Began with survey of Site SC-9. Ziggurat foundation measures 40 x 20 meters, oriented with the four corners facing in the cardinal directions. Initial survey indicates that this temple was dedicated to Nergal and Ereshkigal - principal shrine is missing, but presumed to have been located atop the uppermost platform. \\n Excavation continues at a satisfying pace, with the exception of several hours spent coralling escaped goats. \\n Saturday, September 10, 1921\\nAt about 12\\xa0pm, discovered that B. had gone missing at midday rest. A quick search found him at the southwest portion of the ziggurat in an area originally designated as a midden. Admonished B. for leaving the camp, but was told that B. had stumbled upon a stone step conceled[sic] by dust and debris. A short time sufficed to show that this was the beginning of a staircase cut into the bedrock. Redirected excavation efforts to this location. \\n F. William Abernathy\\'s initial sketch of the tunnel leading to Chamber SC-9-F. \\n Monday, September 12, 1921\\nExcavation of staircase down to thirteenth step compltd[sic], revealing the upper portion of a doorway. An electric torch thrust into a hole made in the upper lintel reveals a short, downward sloping hallway largely filled with soil and debris, leading to a second doorway, also sealed. \\n Tuesday, September 27, 1921\\nLd. M. arrived to oversee operations. Excavation has proceeded as far as first staircase: fifteen steps. Now that entire doorway is visible, signs of apparent violence to hinges evident. Consulted with Eberstrom regarding integrity of structure: carpenters now at work constructing supports for doorway and subsequent corridor. \\n Wednesday, September 28, 1921\\nOpened first doorway. Commenced excavation of debris and rubble from hallway. \\n Friday, September 30, 1921\\nPaid salaries. All accounted for except B., who I was told had left the expedition to return home to his mother, who has taken ill. \\n Saturday, October 1, 1921\\nB. has returned from visiting his mother, and was remonstrated for leaving the expedition without first informing me. \\n The excavation continues at a satisfactory pace. \\n Tuesday, October 11, 1921\\nHave cleared enough of the descending passage that a crawling man could reach the second doorway. A candle, held to a breach made in the upper lintel, reveals a chamber within: apparently a storage chamber for pots (possibly wine or water). With the hopes of the more mercenary members of the exhibition (who hoped for gold and treasures) dashed, it has been decided that the excavation\\'s focus will return to the ziggurat itself, while a smaller team (led by myself) will continue cataloging the contents of this chamber. \\n F. William Abernathy\\'s initial sketch of Chamber SC-9-F. \\n Thursday, October 13, 1921\\nI find myself at a loss to describe the events of the past twenty-four hours, but I will make an effort to do so. \\n There were five of us present at the opening of the second door: Myself, Eberstrom, Carter, and two Arab laborers. The application of an iron bar and a hammer sufficed to force open the chamber, after which a lit candle was held up to the rapidly escaping air as a tell-tale for foul gasses. \\n Having satisfied ourselves as to the safety of the air within the chamber, we entered the room and discovered, as expected, a small storeroom for the storage of wine and oil in clay pots. We had begun cataloging the contents within when a clumsy misstep from Carter caused him to stumble against the wall, causing the pots to collapse. In so doing, he revealed that the back wall of the chamber was false, concealing a secondary chamber from view. \\n Immediately, our eyes were dazzled by the gleam of gold and precious jewels. However, as our eyes adjusted to the light, we soon perceived three human figures laying in repose in the center of the chamber. Two of them were dessicated cadavers, laying with their hands clasped across their chest, dressed in ornate priestly garb. The third, however, caused all of us to be taken aback: a woman, seemingly asleep, laying atop a gilded bed. \\n I am unashamed to admit that I was struck dumb for quite some time at this unexpected development. It was Eberstrom who first percieved the woman\\'s state of undress, and quickly acted to cover her with his Arab-style robe. This seemed to stir the rest of us to action. When calling out, the slapping of wrists, and application of water proved to no avail, we concluded that she must have perished. How, then, could one explain her perfect state of preservation? \\n In our haste, we failed to percieve that one of the two Arabs had become more distressed. Soon, he took up the iron bar which he had used to break open the door of the chamber and lunged towards us, screaming in Arabic that the woman was the Whore of Babylon herself and must be slain. His companion stepped in front of him in an attempt to stop his mad rampage and had his brains dashed out for his troubles. Only Eberstrom\\'s quick actions saved us all from being killed, as he fired his revolver, slaying the madman. \\n Realizing that the commotion would soon draw the attention of the camp, we conspired to keep the contents of this chamber secret. The bodies of the two workers were hastily covered in rubble, then the supports at the outer door were knocked out with a hammer, causing a portion of the corridor to collapse. We told the other members of the expedition that an accident had caused the deaths of the two laborers, and that what had sounded like gunshots were, in fact, the wooden supports giving way. This explanation sufficed to allay the suspicions of most of the expedition members, who heaped blame upon the carpenters for their shoddy work. \\n Eberstrom, Carter, and I held a meeting in my tent with Ld. Marshall after the workers had gone to sleep. It has been decided that, as the Arabs\\' intellects have proven susceptible to irrational violence by the contents of the chambers, only British staff will be allowed to continue the excavation of the hidden chamber, beginning with the rebuilding of the wooden supports. Two men shall be placed at the entrance of the chamber to guard against interlopers. All staff participating in the excavation will be sworn to secrecy, upon fear of being torn apart by berserk Mohammedans should they discover what lies within the hidden chamber. \\n Friday, October 14, 1921\\nAt approximately 2 am last night, I was awakened from a most agreeable slumber by a scream. Leaping from my cot, I took up my glasses and a lantern and ran towards the source of the noise, whereupon I discovered one of the Arab workers in a state of panic, screaming and pointing towards the door of the hidden chamber. \\n It soon transpired that this man had concluded that a great treasure must be hidden within that was being kept from the other workers by the British. Having distracted the guards\\' attention by sharing a quantity of hashish with them, he had made his way into the hidden chamber, where he discovered the contents therein. Upon seeing the woman laying upon the bed, the rascal performed an uncouth and vile act in her presence, upon which he claimed that the corpse\\'s eyes had opened. \\n At first, we believed this a hysteric reaction to his guilt over performing such a dispicable deed, only to be interrupted by cries of alarm from the other onlookers. Turning towards the doorway to the hidden temple, we saw the woman slowly walking towards us, naked as a babe. She spoke several words in an unknown language, then collapsed into my arms, upon which I percieved that she had fallen into a comatose state. \\n This event caused no small amount of commotion among the native workers, but some quick thinking by Carter convinced them that the stranger was my sister, who had arrived in the camp late last night, but was prone to acts of madness and sudden fits of catatonia due to a childhood ailment. The workers were then sent to bed as Eberstrom and Carter assisted me in transporting her to my tent, upon which we placed her in an extra cot to rest. \\n Since that time, the woman has remained comatose, despite all attempts to awaken her. \\n Monday, October 17, 1921\\nEberstrom came to me this afternoon and told me that he believes he has solved the mystery of the comatose woman. He brought with him a rubbing of one of the cuneiform tablets found within the hidden chamber, which has proven to be an erotic poem written in the classic style. Of particular interest to him was the title of the poem itself: \"Awakening the Goddess.\" \\n Eberstrom postulates that the one currently slumbering in my extra cot is, in fact, a manifestation of the goddess \"Kedesh-Nanaya\" described in the poem, citing her striking similarity to the graven images found within the hidden chamber. As further evidence, Eberstrom noted that her prior awakening took place shortly after the grotesque act performed by the native laborer, drawing a connection between them. \\n Further discussion led us to decide on the following course of action: Myself, Carter, and Eberstrom would draw straws. The chosen man would recreate the unsavory act described in the poem, following which we would observe the stranger for any changes in behavior or wakefulness. Should no change in state be detected, we would cease and desist any further research along these lines. \\n Carter was then called to my tent and brought up to speed on this plan. We then proceeded to draw lots, upon which I drew the marked chit. Carter and Eberstrom excused themselves from my tent to give me some privacy, and I proceeded to engage in our chosen course of action. This proved more difficult than anticipated, as childhood punishments against this very act kept coming to mind, but eventually I prevailed. \\n Almost immediately, I perceived that her lips had parted slightly, and her eyes were fluttering open. She then turned towards me, stood from her cot, and spoke several words in an unknown language. I attempted to repeat several of the words back to her, which seemed to cause her some confusion as she looked around at my tent, contemplating its contents. I quickly called Carter and Eberstrom back into my tent, but she remained wakeful only a few minutes longer before once again falling into slumber. \\n It has been decided that we will repeat this experiment the following night, and that the duty of \"Awakening the Goddess\" will fall to a different individual each night. It is hoped that, in so doing, we shall solve the mystery of this stranger, and perhaps the secret of the hidden burial chamber. \\n Monday, October 31, 1921\\nPaid salaries. All accounted for except B., who once again was not present. Ld. Marshall and I have decided that, should he return, he will not be hired on again, due to his constant tardiness and absences. \\n The nightly experiments continue, and have resulted in the following discoveries: \\n Aside from this, the excavation and cataloging of artifacts found within the temple and hidden chambers proceed satisfactorily. \\n Wednesday, November 2, 1921\\nI am writing this entry from the steamship Oberon, en route to London. The expedition has failed, and most of its members are now dead. Only I, Carter, Eberstrom, and Marshall survive to tell the tale. \\n I had left my tent to give Eberstrom some privacy while he carried out the act of worship when I heard cries of alarm coming from the laborers\\' tents. Walking to the top of a nearby dune, I was shocked to find a large number of men on horseback riding through the tents, cutting down the laborers with curved swords and rifles. \\n I do not know how long I stood there in shock, watching the massacre take place, when a cry of warning prompted me to drop to the ground, barely avoiding the sword swung at my head. I rolled onto my back and saw a man astride a black stallion wheeling around for another attack. Once again, it was the quick thinking of Eberstrom that saved my life, as he fired his revolver and struck the man in the chest, hurling him from his horse. A quick search of his body revealed his identity as that of B., the water-carrier who had originally discovered the hidden chamber, and whose constant absences had caused us much grief. \\n I do not know what prompted him to this act of violence. Had it been greed or disaffection from seeing such rich treasures nearby, and not being able to share in the wealth? Or had he fallen prey to the same madness as the laborer who had nearly killed me several weeks before? Perhaps there was a more sinister motive to his murderous actions; either way, we could not remain here, lest we meet the same fate as our laborers. \\n A rushed consultation with my partners resulted in the following course of action: Eberstrom and I would accompany K-N back to England, transporting her within a crate originally intended for the transport of the artifacts we had discovered. Meanwhile, Carter and Ld. Marshall would take the remaining crates of artifacts and travel back to England by another route. We would make contact with each other upon returning to London, upon which we would continue our research into this mystery from a position of safety. \\n I still remember the horrid stench of burning flesh and the screams of our unfortunate laborers as Eberstrom and I drove away into the night, the goddess slumbering in the back of our automobile. The last thing I saw before the sands and the winds hid the excavation site from view was a cloud of smoke and dust rising from the ziggurat: the wretches had dynamited the temple. \\n All of the artifacts that were yet undiscovered there, all the priceless knowledge of the ancients, gone at the hands of a gang of violent thugs.17 \\n Text of a letter written by F. William Abernathy to S. Eberstrom, dated ██-██-████ \\n My dearest Sam, \\n I pray that this letter finds you happy and well. I myself am quite content these days, as Lord T. is a gracious and generous host. It was he who came up with the idea to commission artists to paint portraits of K-N and have those portraits distributed to vendors near army bases, docks, and boarding schools: the resulting influx of energy has resulted in K-N no longer needing our personal efforts to keep her sustained. \\n Our little Society has grown greatly since its founding: what began as a small group of archaeologists, historians, and linguists has now grown to a thriving fellowship of great minds from all around the world. I told you once that I believed the most important thing we could learn from K-N was the true nature of the ancient Sumerian spoken language: how naive that statement seems now! There are things that a goddess can teach us that go far beyond mere language: her wisdom and knowledge has given us a greater understanding of secrets that we once thought the province of God alone. If only the world could know of the amazing archeological finds of Dr. C., or by the discovery of a genuine dragon by G.\\'s South American Expedition: alas, recent events in Siberia have proven that we were wise to begin this exercise in utter secrecy. \\n If there is one dark cloud in this bright sky of ours, it is the news that our old companions Carter and Marshall have sold their share of the treasures entrusted to them and used the funds to start an auction-house and gentleman\\'s club — may their piss burn like fire, and their bowels flow like water! Our buyers have been dispatched to recover as many of these lost artifacts as possible. So far, we have been successful in recovering several of them, though many others remain in the hands of private collectors. \\n I am not, however, writing solely to relay idle gossip. As you may have heard, Father M. has made an attempt to convert K-N to Christianity. At this, he has been somewhat less than successful. However, it was during a lesson on the Book of Genesis that K-N first stated that its depiction of geography was erroneous, upon which it transpired that she had, in fact, visited the very same places described in the Bible. \\n Many years ago, you saved my life twice in the deserts of Syria. I am asking you to come with me again on one more adventure: the greatest adventure that two men could ever embark on. I know that our lives have taken us in very different paths since we parted ways in Manchester, but tell me this: can any man who risked life and limb to rescue a heathen goddess not feel the desire to do the same to discover the Garden of Eden itself? \\n I eagerly await your answer, and hope to see you again soon. \\n Yours Truly,\\nFritz \\n Manifesto of F. William Abernathy, dated 8-30-1939 \\n I write this as the world stands on the brink of another war: a war that promises to be far darker and crueler than any that the world has known before. Short-sighted men wield powers they neither comprehend nor fully control. All that I love is in danger of falling into the abyss of a dark age more wretched than any in human history. \\n I have contemplated over the past few decades the lessons I have learned from Our Ancient Lady. If it were merely the knowledge of languages and cultures long-thought lost, our discovery of her hidden temple would have been the single greatest discovery of our entire human history. But when one also contemplates the knowledge we have gained in things outside mere human comprehension — our greater understanding of the vast and wonderful nature of this strange universe — the thought of losing all of that knowledge to the petty short-sightedness of man cannot be borne. \\n A simple study of human history reveals two harsh, yet simple facts: First, that mankind in its present state has existed for over a quarter of a million years, yet only the past few millenia have seen any real progress. Before then, we huddled in wretched caves and around sputtering fires, cowering in terror at the dark. Faced with the mysteries around us, we called the things in the night \\'gods\\' and \\'demons,\\' and we begged them to spare us and prayed for salvation. But salvation never came, for the things in the night proved indifferent, and often times openly scornful, of our suffering. \\n Secondly: that, when faced with new knowledge, mankind will rebel against it. Every scientific, socioeconomic, political and philosophical advancement is opposed by those who wish to continue living in barbarism. One only look at the examples of Galileo, Socrates, Darwin, and Martin Luther to understand that mankind as a whole is rarely ready when new knowledge is gained. The current state of the world, where men who believe themselves men of wisdom stand on the verge of triggering an orgy of unprecedented death and suffering, illustrates this principle perfectly. \\n Therefore, I and my companions in the Society have come to a simple conclusion: Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. There are no gods or spirits that can protect us. We must stand for ourselves. In a world filled with the absurd and impossible, we must find a way to explain the unexplained, control the uncontrollable, and protect the world we love from the things they do not comprehend, for if we do not, mankind risks falling into the darkest of Dark Ages since the fall of Rome. \\n When I came into the presence of the Guardian At The Gate, it spoke to me a single word: \"Prepare.\" I have long considered the meaning of that command, and I am now ready to begin my preparations for the great work before me. While the rest of mankind dwells in light, I and my companions will stand in the darkness to fight it, imprison it, and shield it from the eyes of the public. We do this not for any king, or country, or religion or creed. We do this for all mankind, so that others may live in a sane and normal world. \\n F. William Abernathy,\\nPresident and Founder, Secret Society for Cultural Preservation.\\n30 August, 1939 \\n Testimony of F. William Abernathy, dated ██-██-2007 \\n I have been giving some thought lately to the origins of our organization. Some would say that we began with the publishing of the Secure Containment Manifesto in 1939. Others would claim that our organization began when I first approached the Gate Guardian and received its command to prepare for the challenges to come. Still others mark the beginning of our organization as far back as the 19th Century or even further, depending on which Victorian occult society one wishes to consider the originator of our Foundation. \\n In my mind, however, the moment that the Foundation truly began was 1921, as a nervous, frightened young archaeologist, raised on Victorian notions of sexuality, knelt before the incarnation of divine, sacred sexuality in the flesh and carried out his first act of worship before her. \\n It seems ridiculous when I say it out loud: a global power, one of the most powerful occult organizations in the world, all beginning with a young man struggling to masturbate in the Syrian desert? The very idea is laughable. And yet, as an old man, facing the end of my (admittedly prolonged) life, I believe that this was the moment that our Foundation truly began. \\n Or, perhaps more accurately: her Foundation. \\n The ancient Mesopotamians viewed their monarchy as a mandate handed down directly from the gods. The king was the vessel through which the gods spoke to humanity. With that being the case, would not the consort of a goddess themselves also be considered to have divine mandate? Could the rapid rise of our Foundation be due to our status as the beloved of Kedesh-Nanaya? \\n What of the circumstances at the time when she chose to conceal herself in the hidden chamber? History shows that the cult of Nanaya became absorbed into the cult of Inanna around the time period that the goddess secreted herself away. Is it possible that this was her plan all along? To slumber the millenia away until such time as her adversaries became dead and forgotten, to rise again long after their deaths? \\n Was it mere coincidence that placed the secret to her reawakening in the same chamber in which she slumbered? \\n Once, many years ago, I compared the unknown and strange things of the world to the gods and devils of legend. If that is the case, then our Foundation can be a god in itself, for we bind, imprison, and control that which ancient Man would have called gods. And at the heart of our organization, the secret seat of power responsible for our rise to prominence, is a goddess who waited for thousands of years in silent slumber for the opportunity to take back her place at the head of a new pantheon. \\n If this were true, I would not know whether to laugh, cry, or shiver in terror at the thought. \\n F. William Abernathy,\\nAdministrator, SCP Foundation. \\n « SCP-4959 | SCP-4960 | SCP-4961 »\"', 'SCP-4969': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-4969 \\n SCP-4969 instance floating in gestation fluid. \\n Item #: SCP-4969 \\n Object Class: Euclid \\n Special Containment Procedures: A small batch of SCP-4969 is contained in Cryo-Storage Locker 4969 in Wing E3 of Site-56. Search conditions for all \"LiveFeel\" Products and known product terminology are to be added to Foundation web crawlers. MTF Nu-63 (Safe Sects) are to be dispatched to locations suspected to be producing SCP-4969. All affected individuals are to be taken into Foundation custody for research and neutralization. Any SCP-4969 found for sale are to be removed from circulation and destroyed. \\n Description: SCP-4969 are a species of parasitic gelatinous zooplankton. SCP-4969 are extremely resilient compared to other zooplankton and greatly resemble male condoms. Instances are capable of living in a hibernated state for up to 2 years in their birth environment, which is primarily comprised of a saline and nutrient emulsion. When placed on a human penis, SCP-4969 will fuse to the host and bond with its nerves and blood vessels. Using this process, SCP-4969 will obtain all further needs until its natural death after 12 hours, after which all bonds are severed and the instance can be removed from its host. SCP-4969 instances will expire within 10 minutes if exposed to air without being attached to a host. \\n Hosts, hereafter referred to as SCP-4969-1, describe a slight burning sensation during the short bonding process. After bonding, SCP-4969 will then flood the host\\'s system with a mixture of chemicals1 with a highly aphrodisiac effect. Additionally, whenever a host has conscious or subconscious sexual urges or tendencies, high amounts of dopamine are infused into the host to further promote sexual activity. SCP-4969 is noted to greatly amplify the pleasure of sexual intercourse. Due to the narcotic nature of the anomaly, hosts are prone to wearing SCP-4969 instances constantly. \\n If an SCP-4969-1 instance successfully engages in sexual activity with another human, regardless of sex or reproductive abilities, an outer layer of cells from the bonded SCP-4969 instance will shed off and enter the partner\\'s bloodstream, beginning the organism\\'s breeding process. After a period of two weeks, the partner will show signs of abdominal swelling, caused by the gestation of the shed SCP-4969\\'s cells. Inspection of partner individuals, now designated SCP-4969-2, will invariably show them to be spawning more instances of SCP-49692. Gestation lasts approximately 2 months per batch, whereafter an amount of between 50 to 300 SCP-4969 instances will be expelled3 from the carrier, along with a large quantity of gestational fluid. Hosts are often confused, disturbed, and fearful of this process. \\n During the month of July 20██, planted Foundation Agents in a rural South African township noticed an above-average drop in visible female civilians. This, combined with strange behaviour and lack of concern from the remaining members of the public and authorities, was considered sufficient for the approval of further investigation and additional assets. \\n A small team of agents raided a home suspected of containing information regarding the missing females and discovered a makeshift facility using female hostages to produce what is now known to be SCP-4969. After a short investigation involving host interrogation, the origin of SCP-4969 was traced to Gauteng, a major city in the country. \\n Using information received from undercover agents posing as civilians interested in SCP-4969, Foundation agents infiltrated and destroyed multiple locations producing SCP-4969 and, in the process, discovered the following notable details: \\n Transcript of Field Interview with SCP-4969-1-56: \\n The following interview is transcribed footage from a Foundation agent\\'s hidden bodycam. SCP-4969-1-56 (1-56) was suspected to be the leader of a production base in ████ █████████, South Africa. Instance was approached by Agent Lannister (AL) under the guise of being a meeting with a prospective buyer from a large service station chain. \\n AL: Hi, you must be ████. I\\'m Andrew, from ██████. \\n 1-56: Hey! Yeah, that\\'s me. Nice to meet you. \\n AL: I hear you\\'ve got a product I might be interested in. \\n 1-56: Yeah, I\\'m really surprised Robert managed to get you to meet with me! We usually have to approach guys like you. \\n AL: I just loved his enthusiasm for the product and wanted to hear it from the boss himself. \\n 1-56: Of course! I mean, anything to get more clients, y\\'know? Say, about Bob, you seen him around lately? He\\'s been scarce. \\n AL: No, sorry. Haven\\'t heard from him since he helped me set this up. \\n 1-56: That\\'s okay, I\\'m sure he\\'ll turn up, he\\'ll be worried about his girl. So what did you wanna know? \\n AL: Tell me what you have, sell me your product. \\n 1-56: Oh, man. These things kinda just sell themselves. You use condoms regularly, Andrew? \\n AL: As much as the next guy, I guess. \\n 1-56: Oh come on! An attractive guy like you? You know the struggle, it\\'s just not as good as raw sex. Even those super thin ones, they just don\\'t compare to the real thing, y\\'know? \\n AL: I suppose. \\n 1-56: Well, these babies… \\n SCP-4969-1-56 pulls out a single SCP-4969 package. \\n 1-56: These babies are something special. You put \\'em on and it\\'s like you just slipped on a little slice of heaven. Not only do you not lose any feeling, everything feels better. \\n AL: How so? \\n 1-56: They\\'re 100% organic! No bad chemicals, none of that tingly shit that you\\'re supposed to enjoy but don\\'t. Just pure fuckin\\' pleasure dude! I\\'m feeling frisky just thinking about it. It\\'s that good. \\n AL: What do you mean organic? \\n 1-56: Oh, yeah, 100% organic. \\n AL: Yes, but how? You\\'re saying that you use naturally occurring latex from organic tree plantations? \\n 1-56: Oh, they\\'re not latex. \\n AL: They\\'re not latex? I mean, if this is a new material you\\'re using you\\'ll have to give me a lot more information. Especially if you want us to buy these. \\n 1-56: Okay, understandable. Well, they\\'re a natural compound manufactured by my wife and I. \\n AL: So, handmade? \\n 1-56: No, look. Dude, Are you gonna buy them or not? \\n AL: I can\\'t just jump into a transaction like this, I have higher ups. \\n 1-56 is silent for several seconds. \\n AL: ████? \\n 1-56: Okay, okay. I tell you what… \\n SCP-4969-1-56 moves closer to Agent Lannister and begins rubbing their inner thigh area. \\n AL: What ar— \\n 1-56: Just try one, Bob\\'s girl is in the car. Just slip it on and go for i— \\n AL: Are you fucking serious? \\n 1-56: What? \\n AL: You want me to have sex with one of your colleague\\'s partners? To test a product? \\n 1-56: Relax! She\\'s not going anywhere, she\\'s in the trunk o— \\n AL: The trunk of your car?! \\n 1-56: Fucking chill dude, she\\'s affecting business, this was Rob\\'s responsibility for fucks sake. \\n Agent Lannister later confirmed feigning interest to find the hostage. \\n AL: Okay, take me uh… Take me to her. \\n 1-56: Fuck yeah! Dude, you\\'re gonna love this. Let\\'s go. \\n SCP-4969-1-56 leads Agent Lannister to a minivan in an alleyway near the meeting place. \\n 1-56: She\\'s in here, don\\'t get too carried away haha we\\'re in public. \\n SCP-4969-1-56 opens trunk of vehicle, revealing an unidentified teenager (TG) before removing gag from her mouth. \\n 1-56: (To girl) — Now, remember what I told you. Don\\'t make a sound okay? \\n Agent Lannister is seen attacking SCP-4969-1-56. \\n AL: You shitbag! Six-three move in on— my location, hostage found in suspect\\'s vehicle. \\n 1-56: Who the hell are you talki— Hey! Wha— \\n Agent Lannister switches off bodycam. \\n At the conclusion of the interview, a team of standby agents successfully cleared, amnestized and freed the kidnapped civilian. Further investigation revealed the location used as SCP-4969-1-56\\'s breeding facility. Nine gestating individuals were found being held unwillingly. SCP-4969-1-56 was successfully apprehended but expired in custody as a result of unidentified blunt force injuries. \\n « SCP-4968 | SCP-4969 | SCP-4970 »\"', 'SCP-5069': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-5069 \\n Item #: SCP-5069 \\n Object Class: Safe \\n Special Containment Procedures: Celluloid copies of SCP-5069-1 though 8 are to be kept in standard storage lockers in the media storage wing of Site-28.

SCP-5069 instances range in duration from 34 minutes to over four hours, and (with the exception of SCP-5069-4) appear to have been filmed in one continuous take. SCP-5069 was created by Francesco Castaldo (PoI-33906), an Italian anomalous artist active in New York and Venice from the early 1960s until the late 1980s, under the alias \"Franco Spanko\". \\n SCP-5069 instances have no inherent anomalous properties. It is believed that the sex acts depicted in SCP-5069 instances are thaumatological rituals, the purpose of which is currently unclear; research is ongoing under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Sinombre has ceased indefinitely. \\n Copied from a text file retrieved from Dr. Sinombre\\'s office computer. \\n Jennifer N Sinombre - preliminary notes on the SCP-5069 project 5/5/86 \\n so the new project is a series of spooky ritualistic porn films. not thrilled, of course, because it\\'s starting to feel like i\\'m the erotica expert now, but maybe if i keep it up long enough they\\'ll make me the head of an actual sub-department of pornography and i can get a raise. anyway it can\\'t be worse than the last project - had to get a new keyboard, the dolphin fluids were never gonna come out. \\n documentation suggests that they might even be non-anomalous, but the verdict is still out - i haven\\'t watched the films yet but from what i\\'ve heard about them and about Castaldo i\\'m pretty sure they\\'re going to be thaumaturgy. pulling up some texts on sex magick - crowley, parsons, de naglowska - in case any of it is relevant. \\n the d-class who watched the films didn\\'t show any anomalous symptoms. some of them requested to see them again, but no memetic compulsion there—pretty sure the commissary doesn\\'t even sell the swimsuit issue, so it\\'s the only porn they\\'ve seen in ages. i\\'m going to start watching them today, should finish with them tomorrow. \\n watched some of Castaldo\\'s non-anart work last night, just to get a sense of his directorial style. definitely leans more toward erotica than gonzo, with a heavy dose of surrealism. tends to pick classical settings—he loves his ancient roman aesthetics. according to the critics, his best work is Le Barbare (The Barbarian Women). it\\'s definitely strange—like Caligula crossed with Eraserhead—but i have to say, i\\'m a fan. \\n AV just let me know that the projector\\'s ready to go. can\\'t bring my computer into the screening room, so it\\'s back to the stone age. \\n Summaries written by Dr. Sinombre; notes transcribed from a notebook retrieved from Dr. Sinombre\\'s desk. \\n Transcribed from a notebook retrieved from Dr. Sinombre\\'s desk. \\n J.

Parents, Maria and Gabriele Castaldo, were anti-fascist resistance fighters; father died when Castaldo was 2 years old. Mother remarried her dead husband\\'s brother, Enrico, after the war. Family moved to Venice in 1950; stepfather worked as a longshoreman, mother as a typist. \\n Attended the Accademia delle Belle Arte di Venezia (Venetian Academy of Fine Arts) in 1962. Became involved in Venetian anomalous art community shortly thereafter via a girlfriend, Lucia Marinetti. In 1964, applied to the Venetian School of the Medicea Accademia Dell\\'Arte Occulta (Medici Academy of Occult Art) and was accepted; expelled six months later for obscenity and blasphemy. \\n Moved to New York City in 1967. Began to direct and produce non-anomalous erotic films, most notably Le Barbare (The Barbarian Women) and Rex Mundi (King of the World), both of which were critically acclaimed but had little commercial success. In 1968, became involved with anomalous art collective Are We Cool Yet?, and was given the title \"The Director\" when the founding Director, PoI-23328 (\"Daniel Calderwood\") died during a performance of SCP-701 (see Incident Report 701-██/██/1968). In 1969 or 1970, became romantically involved with PoI-3337-A, Luisa Bellocchio (alias \"The Photographer\"). \\n In 1975, left AWCY? and broke off relationship with Bellocchio. Checked into experimental drug rehabilitation facility in October 1975, citing addiction to alcohol and prescription painkillers. In 1977, began to produce the series of erotic films recently designated SCP-5069; completed series in 1982. Addiction relapse in 1983 presumably sparked by Bellocchio\\'s suicide; has not been active in the art world since, although he has written a number of non-anomalous erotic novels under the pen name \"Christopher D\\'Omera\". \\n Copied from a text file retrieved from Dr. Sinombre\\'s office computer. \\n JN Sinombre 5/7/86 \\n there\\'s something missing in franco\\'s poi file. why are we so sure he\\'s a thaumaturge? as far as i can tell, nothing in his background points to him being anything more than an anartist. exploits yes, magic no. might be some supplemental material elsewhere, i\\'ll keep digging. \\n m.a.d.a.o. does some thaumatology but we\\'ve got his transcripts from there, italian branch has pretty good relations with them, and he never did anything but anart. well, they don\\'t call it anart, but whatever the aristocratic italian equivalent is. and he got kicked out in half a year, something about nude photos of the pope? that part is actually pretty heavily redacted, i think they might\\'ve tried to get the vatican involved. \\n got the possible locations for -1. all over the map, probably never going to narrow it down. just too many east-facing beaches at the correct latitudes, plus we don\\'t actually know what time of year it was filmed. need to look up sun gods next. \\n may have found one of the actors in -3. doesn\\'t make ANY sense though. Lt. Col. Henry Mostrich, US Army, retired. happily married to Mrs. Elizabeth Pavo Mostrich since 1963. purple heart and distinguished service cross earned in vietnam. war hero, grandfather, upstanding citizen. the face seems to match, but—according to the army\\'s medical records—he doesn\\'t have all those scars. makeup? why did he act in the film in the first place? \\n more thoughts on -8. cut on the heel is actually two small incisions, almost like a snake bite. washing moves down the body, inverting the chakra flow. kundalini serpent-power? opening orifices = opening doors = opening chakras? need to see if franco had any contact w eastern mysticism. \\n jackpot - franco did an interview with an anart zine right after -8 was released. getting anart dept to send me over a copy. \\n This interview was published in the Spring 1982 edition of Anartchy, a quarterly anomalous art zine published by a collective of anartists based out of Backdoor Soho. \\n Originally from Friuli, Francesco Castaldo, better known as \"Franco Spanko\", made a name for himself in the Venice scene with Papi senz\\' Abiti (Popes without Robes), his \\'65 series of nude photographs of every pope since St. Peter. Anartchy\\'s Dan Larsson caught up with Castaldo in his Soho studio to chat about inspiration, metaphysics, and the mystical properties of his latest work, the erotic film series Eightfold Path to Glory. \\n Dan Larsson: So, where did the inspiration for Eightfold Path come from? It seems pretty esoteric, yeah? \\n Francesco Castaldo: Well, you know, in \\'75 I had some problems with the drinking and the pills, and I went to a rehab center with a sensory deprivation tank—total sensory deprivation, the sigils on the inside turn all your senses off—and while I was floating there, going through withdrawal, really just out of my mind, I had a vision. The upper realms, they were laid out before me, and all the powers and their dominions and emanations; I saw the true structure of the world, beyond the walls of what we call reality. And from all that knowledge, I derived eight rituals, which are much, much more powerful than their reflections in magic and religion, and I had those rituals performed, and I filmed them. And those films are the Eightfold Path. \\n Larsson: Wow. That\\'s pretty heavy. But—not to put too fine a point on it—a skin flick isn\\'t the traditional format for conveying occult knowledge. Why not write some sort of occult grimoire, or found a cult to pass on your secrets? \\n Castaldo: You do what you\\'re good at, you know? Dante had the Inferno, Michelangelo had the Capella Sistina, and I made a porno. \\n Larsson: Makes sense. There\\'s clearly a lot of heavy symbolism, but it seems like each individual film explores a different theme—mind unpacking some of that for our readers? \\n Castaldo: There are eight forces that pervade the higher spheres. You may think of them as elements, or philosophies, or perhaps political factions. None of those ways of seeing are untrue, but neither are they the truth. And each of those forces has a path that a practitioner may take, up through the gates of the mind into glory. The rituals in the films can guide one in the right direction. \\n Larsson: So, if my boyfriend and I found a boxing ring and recreated Bone Deep, we would, what, become enlightened? \\n Castaldo: Well, it\\'s not that simple.

PoI-33906 agreed to meet for a short interview, which took place in his agent\\'s office in New York City. Interview was transcribed from a cassette tape retrieved from Dr. Sinombre\\'s office. \\n Subject: PoI-33906, Francesco Castaldo \\n Interviewer: Dr. Jennifer Sinombre \\n Dr. Sinombre (JNS): Thank you for meeting me on such short notice, Mr. Castaldo. \\n PoI-33906 (FC): Think nothing of it. Anything for the fans, no? \\n JNS: So, I\\'d like to start with Eightfold Path to Glory. \\n FC: Ah! My magnum opus. I must confess, that phrase has always amused me. Everyone always says it with such seriousness. But, well… \\n JNS: It makes you think of the condom size? \\n FC: Ha! I can see we are on the same page. So, what would you like to know about the Eightfold Path? \\n JNS: Well, I wanted to know about some of the symbolism you used in, uh, I guess specifically Pounding Beneath the Skin. Uh, Below, sorry. That\\'s all based on the cult of Attis and Cybele, right? \\n FC: Yes! Right on the head. So many people, they miss the historical references. \\n JNS: So what would\\'ve happened if a man had, uh, \"won\"? I mean, mythologically speaking, Attis is only really known for the one thing… \\n FC: Hmm. It was all staged, you know? This was not a real ritual any more than, say, La Cena4 was a real dinner party. But… \\n JNS: But? \\n FC: But, if one were to take the lessons laid out in Pounding, and act out a ritual devised from those lessons, and a man were to, as you say, win the contest, he would have to make a great sacrifice if he wished to take the next step. \\n JNS: Do you know if anyone has ever done that? Performed one of the rituals you say are hidden in the films? \\n FC: Not with Pounding, as far as I\\'m aware. Perhaps Sun Kissed Lovers, or maybe… Hmm. Your ankle. \\n JNS: Excuse me? \\n FC: Your ankle. It\\'s bandaged, yes? \\n JNS: Uh, yes. Cut myself shaving. Last night. \\n FC: Hmm. Of course. Do you know what I find interesting about wounds? \\n JNS: I… No, I suppose I don\\'t. \\n FC: There is an Italian proverb. An old one, older even than the Romans. It was first recorded by Horace, when he wrote about the witch-women of the Fucine marshes. \"Not all doors are wounds, but all wounds are doors.\" \\n JNS: I\\'m not sure I understand. What is it supposed to mean? \\n FC: Well, it\\'s about… Opening. A wound opens up our inside to the outside. And stuff can pass through, germs, dirt, but… \\n JNS: But we can pass through it as well. \\n FC: Exactly. Did you pass through that wound, when you cut yourself? While shaving, of course. \\n JNS: I… Yes. \\n FC: And would you like to go further? \\n JNS: Definitely. \\n FC: Then switch off that recorder, and let us actually speak. \\n Recovered from Dr. Sinombre\\'s personal residence. \\n it\\'s not thaumaturgy. it\\'s what thaumaturgy could be, in a different history. it\\'s what thaumaturgy SHOULD be, and CAN be, if i open the right doors. \\n i have been there, in my dreams, through the first door. tonight i will pass through the second, in both body and soul. do not try to follow me. find your own path, and maybe we will meet again, somewhere in the higher realms. \\n to the foundation: we have failed. or we never had the chance to succeed. everything in our little boxes, the statues and the gods, the talking birds and the time-loop suicides, all are pale shadows cast by the real forces that shape the universe. we could not contain the Dominions, no more than a gnat could contain a hurricane. \\n to my successor (david? elaine?): you can do it too. it\\'s all there, if they let you see the films. i cannot give you any more guidance, but i wish you well. \\n and to ted and katy5: we had our goodbye eight years ago. i don\\'t miss you any more. i hope you don\\'t repeat your mistakes, and i hope you\\'re not even given a chance to make them again. \\n Jennifer N Sinombre, 19 May 1986 \\n Dr. Sinombre\\'s whereabouts are currently unknown.

The remainder are in the possession of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., or potentially their clientele. Proposals regarding the use of SCP-5169 instances as assassination devices are pending. \\n Description: SCP-5169 is a series of sex dolls, developed for commercial sale by Charles Maximune, an anartist and entrepreneur formerly employed by Marshall, Carter, and Dark, Ltd. Both male and female configured SCP-5169 instances are available, and may possess various accessories. \\n Each SCP-5169 instance is physically indistinguishable from a comparable non-anomalous product. However, when used to climax by one or more human beings,1 SCP-5169 instances will spontaneously explode. Forensic examination of SCP-5169 detonations reveals no apparent chemical or other physical cause, suggesting that SCP-5169 instances function by ectoentropically generating explosive force. \\n Addendum 5169-1: Discovery \\n The SCP-5169 instances presently contained were recovered as part of a sting operation conducted by MTF Mu-3 (\"Highest Bidders\"), in order to confiscate any anomalous products possessed by Mr. Maximune. Initially, Mr. Maximune and any locations or persons he was known to be associated with were to be kept under surveillance until Director McBride2 gave the green light for his agents to take action. \\n Home of Charles Maximune. \\n However, on 3/9/2020, two weeks into surveillance, an explosion at Maximune\\'s North Andover, Massachusetts residence called for immediate intervention. In the guise of FBI agents, Mu-3 personnel raided the house and confiscated all confirmed or suspected anomalies. One human corpse was recovered and identified as Maximune\\'s romantic associate, Lawrence Kistler. \\n Additionally, Marshall, Carter, and Dark security staff took Mr. Maximune into custody regarding an incident in their Quality Assurance Department. He was then fired and remanded to the Foundation for interrogation and amnesticization. \\n Interviewer: Director Jacob McBride \\n Interviewed: Charles Maximune \\n Interviewer: What exactly was the nature of your work at MC&D? \\n Interviewed: Well, I worked in anart acquisitions for a while. But that had nothing to do with why I got fired. \\n Interviewer: Why did you get fired? \\n Interviewed: It was the dolls. We had, uh, just received our shipment at London HQ. Testing was just starting up. The first tester, well, fucked one of them, and… boom. Chain reaction. \\n Interviewer: I take it the damage was serious? \\n Interviewed: You could say that. There is no more QA department at London headquarters. \\n Interviewer: So, why do the dolls explode? \\n Interviewed: Well, I can tell you that wasn\\'t my fault. Dark gave me this project a few weeks ago, told me it would be convenient if we could move into the synthetic sex trade just like the real one, and that she wanted me to see what sorts of anomalous features we could give to regular inflatable dolls. The thing is, I had a lot on my plate when I was asked to take over. So I gave the work to someone else. \\n Interviewer: Who? \\n Interviewed: Some drug dealer operating out of the states. He was recommended to me by a colleague. \\n Interviewer: And he made the dolls to explode when people… finished with them? Why? \\n Interviewed: Well… maybe it was a little my fault. I told him I wanted \"blow up dolls,\" and he\\'s, well, not the most literate person. \\n Interviewer: He thought you wanted lethal sex toys? \\n Interviewed: Yeah. Like I said. Not the most literate. \\n Interviewer: ...I think I know exactly who you\\'re talking about. \\n Hi, I\\'m Max. I work for Iris Dark. Are you this dado guy she mentions sometimes? \\n Oh, nice.\\nI\\'m a huge fan of your work, and I was wondering if you might listen to a business proposal. \\n I mostly work in MCD\\'s underground hospitality department.

SCP-5208-1 is available for testing to Thaumaturge Division personnel with Level 3/5208 Clearance or higher. \\n All members of the Site-51 Thaumaturgy Division are to consume no less than 45 grams of Kellogg\\'s cornflakes daily. \\n SCP-5208-Ω. \\n SCP-5208 is the collective designation given to a series of events and anomalies related to SCP-5208-Ω, an Abrahamic-Thaumaturge and scientist by the name of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (1852 – 1943). SCP-5208-Ω was a member of a secret esoteric suborder of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, known as the Knights of the Seventh Day (GOI-5208SD), a group tasked with using anomalous means to covertly promote the church\\'s beliefs. SCP-5208-Ω\\'s efforts to eliminate humanity\\'s \"sinful vices\" emphasized sexual behavior, specifically masturbation. These efforts lead to the creation of SCP-5208-1, SCP-5208-2, and SCP-5208-3. \\n SCP-5208-1. \\n SCP-5208-2 are a species of non-corporeal humanoid Null-Class Demonic Entities1 capable of parasitic propagation through human hosts. Instances of SCP-5208-2 display only rudimentary instinctual behavior, such as survival and procreation. Human individuals within a 3-meter radius of SCP-5208-2 will begin showing signs of increased libido; this effect increases as the distance decreases. Within 1 meter the effect of SCP-5208-2 begins showing one or more of the following symptoms: \\n Of these symptoms, uncontrollable masturbation is the most common, with more diverse symptoms manifesting with an increased presence of SCP-5208-2 instances. Prolonged exposure of a non-anomalous human to SCP-5208-2 instances causes a new SCP-5208-2 instance to manifest within the exposed person. After vomiting these new instances, the human hosts have an approximately 22% chance of developing long-term chronic exposure symptoms. SCP-5208-2 show an aversion to human subjects who have consumed a full serving of Kellogg\\'s Corn Flakes with a 24-hour period before exposure. This aversion can be overcome when multiple SCP-5208-2 instances are present. \\n SCP-5208-Ω used SCP-5208-1 and at least 50 SCP-5208-2 instances to enact a combinatorial process that manifested a new entity. This new entity, designated SCP-5208-3, is a Princeps-Class Demonic Entity4 claiming the name Asmodeus. Measuring approximately 4 meters tall, SCP-5208-3 has a vaguely humanoid body consisting of a black viscous liquid of unidentifiable composition. SCP-5208-3 has been observed to be capable of speech, teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and the creation of new SCP-5208-2 instances5. \\n Will Keith Kellogg. \\n  \\nSCP-5208 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on 1927/2/23, by SCP-5208-Ω\\'s biological brother and business partner, Will Keith Kellogg (1860 – 1951). SCP-5208-Ω and Mr. Kellogg directed the Battle Creek Sanitarium6 from 1876 to 1943; SCP-5208-Ω focused on his duties as a member of the GOI-5208SD and Mr. Kellogg directed the Sanitarium\\'s superficial operations. Mr. Kellogg contacted the Foundation through their mutual acquaintance, Asa Candler, and a meeting was organized between Mr. Kellogg and Foundation Investigative Agent James Mueller.\\n \\n \\n  \\n Audio Log Transcript \\n Date: 1927/2/23 \\n Interviewer: FIA James Mueller \\n Interviewed: Will Keith Kellogg \\n [BEGIN LOG] \\n Mueller: Mr. Kellogg, are you ready to begin? \\n Kellogg: Remains silent. \\n Mueller: Is there an issue, sir? \\n Kellogg: I was told your organization practices discretion; I can\\'t afford to be connected to this. \\n Mueller: Ah yes, rest assured this recording is for our records and nothing else. \\n Kellogg: I suppose that\\'s okay, if you insist. \\n Mueller: Now, why have you called this meeting Mr. Kellogg? Mr. Candler spoke of an imminent threat. \\n Kellogg: It\\'s my brother. I fear he is in over his head. \\n Mueller: You\\'re going to need to be more specific, Mr. Kellogg. \\n Kellogg: My brother is Dr. John Kellogg, he is the Director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. He\\'s been secretly working for a group called the Knights of the Seventh Day. He has been for a long time now, but things are different. He\\'s changed. \\n Mueller: We have been investigating the organization for some time now. What– \\n Kellogg: He\\'s not a bad man. They\\'re trying to do good, I know they are. But this work, those cursed texts have corrupted him. He\\'s blinded by devotion; he can\\'t even see it all unraveling around him. \\n Mueller: What exactly is your brother\\'s connection with this organization? \\n Kellogg: His position is known as a Knight Commander, one of seven as I understood it. He has been tasked with the elimination of the sin of lust. \\n Mueller: As a concept? \\n Kellogg: As if I would know– I thought it was just a fraternity when I first learned of it years ago. It wasn\\'t until the weird experiments started that I really saw they were doing. Magic, not your Houdini type magic mind you, but real magic. The last few years though…he\\'s changed. He filled an entire wing at Battle Creek with victims of whatever is going on. \\n Mueller: Does your brother know of your… \"concerns\"? \\n Kellogg: He won\\'t listen to me. I could only imagine what he would do if he found out I\\'ve come to you for help. \\n Mueller: I understand, Mr. Kellogg. So, what exactly have you called this meeting to accomplish? \\n Kellogg: I don\\'t want my brother getting hurt, not by you and certainly not by whatever he\\'s gotten himself wrapped up in. I don\\'t understand the esoteric ways of my brother, I never have– but your organization does, or so I have been told. \\n Mueller: What exactly do you fear will happen to your brother? \\n Kellogg: The Church is demanding results; they think he\\'s lost control of the situation and wants to see it rectified. I know my brother is planning something big and I just don\\'t want anything happening to him. He\\'s lost his way– I just want him guided back. \\n Mueller: I see. Mr. Kellogg, if you\\'ll give me a moment I need to speak with my supervisor. \\n Kellogg: Will you help him? I\\'m willing to pay, money is not a– \\n Mueller: Do not worry about a thing, we\\'ll handle it from here. \\n [END LOG] \\n Afterword: Will Kellogg was released under the condition that he assist the Foundation in containing SCP-5208. Following approval, a full-scale investigation of John Kellogg, Battle Creek Sanitarium, and the Knights of the Seventh Day was initiated.\\n  \\n Battle Creek Sanitarium, circa 1927. \\n Direct investigations into GOI-5208SD were successfully hindered by the effort of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Investigation Task Force Bravo-3 (\"Busy Bodies\") was tasked with infiltrating the Battle Creek Sanitarium in order to covertly gather information on SCP-5208-Ω and GOI-5208SD. On 1927/3/19, ITF Bravo-3 successfully began its mission.\\n \\n \\n \\n_\\n  \\n The following logs were transcribed and summarized from ITF Bravo-3\\'s notes: \\n The four members of ITF Bravo-3 secured the following positions within the Battle Creek Sanitarium: \\n The sanitarium is run like a resort, though a large section is inaccessible by most staff and patrons. This section is known as Wing-K and is used by SCP-5208-Ω to conduct its research. SCP-5208-Ω hand-selects the personnel allowed to work within this section, Mr. Kellogg is unable to give the team access. All personnel and patrons are required to eat a bowl of cornflakes for breakfast daily. \\n   \\n On 1927/3/24, Agent Easton received a disciplinary mark from the Day-Shift Security Captain for inappropriate behavior. Agent Easton was \"getting fresh\" while attempting flirtation with several day-shift nurses. A review of Agent Easton\\'s conduct will be conducted at the conclusion of this investigation. \\n The team is well situated in our positions but have been incapable of gaining entry to Wing-K. Samples of the cornflakes were taken but all testing revealed it to have no abnormal or anomalous properties. \\n   \\n   \\n Agent Fettle has formalized a complaint that Agent Easton attempted to force himself on her in an unwarranted sexual advance. Whether this is an effect of the anomaly we are investigating, or a lack of proper conduct is currently unknown. Agent Vanholt notes that situations like this are why he was apprehensive regarding the inclusion of women on ITF teams. \\n The team discovered an array of thaumaturgic symbols surrounding the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The symbols were etched and carved into trees and stones every 3 meters. \\n Thaumaturgic symbol found on the property. \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n Agent Vanholt successful replaced Ethan Knox as Wing K Security Captain. Initial review of Wing K: \\n Unlike the rest of the sanitarium Wing K looks like a traditional medical wing found in most asylums. All Wing K personnel are required to eat cornflakes for every meal and communication between personnel is strictly forbidden barring work-related duties. Agent Vanholt is scheduled to receive a tour of the Wing K facilities by SCP-5208-Ω itself, he will attempt to record this encounter. \\n On 1927/4/8, Foundation Outpost KJ657 received the following radio transmission. \\n Audio Log Transcript \\n Date: 1927/4/8 \\n Recorder: Captain Vanholt \\n Foreword: The following recording was taken within Wing K of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, during Agent Vanholt\\'s meeting with SCP-5208-Ω. \\n [BEGIN LOG] \\n Vanholt: Hello sir, it is an honor to finally make your acquaintance. \\n SCP-5208-Ω: Undoubtedly, Mr. Cornwall. \\n Vanholt: I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity. \\n SCP-5208-Ω: With my brother\\'s recommendation and a résumé as exemplary as your own, how could I not? \\n [Both chuckle] \\n SCP-5208-Ω: Let us begin, follow me.

Children growing up to never know the love of our Lord and savior– it is our mission here to overturn this complacency, to drag this nation into the light of our lord. \\n Vanholt: I am unsure I understand, sir. \\n SCP-5208-Ω: Outside of this wing what does the sanitarium offer its patrons? \\n Vanholt: I don– \\n SCP-5208-Ω: Clarity! We offer them clarity, of body and mind. Here though, here is where we offer them clarity of the soul. \\n Vanholt: How exactly do we do that? \\n SCP-5208-Ω: By ridding them of the very root of all man\\'s ailments, sin. \\n Vanholt: That sure sounds swell doctor, but how does that work? \\n SCP-5208-Ω: Oh so eager, fine Mr. Cornwall, allow me to demonstrate. Right through here, please. \\n Vanholt: What in the he– \\n SCP-5208-Ω: Welcome, I\\'m fairly certain you are well acquainted with my brother. \\n Kellogg: Please John, I\\'m begging you, I only meant to help!

I will not stand one more treacherous word from your mouth! \\n Vanholt: Get your hands off me– [The sounds of chains rattling can be heard as Agent Vanholt is presumably restrained.] \\n SCP-5208-Ω: So the Knights are finally making their move against me. After all I have done, everything I\\'ve accomplished! \\n Kellogg: Please brother, this has gone far enough you need to stop! \\n SCP-5208-Ω: You brought them here! Your jealousy, your pride, and your arrogance has turned you against me. Worry not brother, you will witness me finish what I have started– one final ritual to rid the world of lust. \\n [SCP-5208-Ω begins chanting in an unknown language, Mr. Kellogg can be heard screaming incoherently.] \\n Vanholt: We need help, send the– \\n [END LOG] \\n Afterword: Following this transmission Outpost KJ65 received a final Investigation Log from Battle Creek Sanitarium. \\n \"Battle Creek has descended into madness.\" SCP-5208-Ω has been wandering the halls, without clothing, using a staff(SCP-5208-1) to create new SCP-5208-2 instances by striking the patients. This group of SCP-5208-2 instances gathered in the courtyard, participating in a voraphilic ritual with SCP-5208-Ω and the Wing K orderlies. \"They created something terrible. It’s turned this whole place topsy-turvy, it\\'s a bloodbath, a massacre, an orgy. Please, send help.\" Hostile entities are noted as incorporeal and do not respond to standard ammunition or blunt force trauma. \\n Photograph of multiple SCP-5208-2 instances participating in group sex. \\n On 1927/4/10, the Foundation dispatched Mobile Strike Force Zulu-1 (\"Holy Rollers\")8 and the Site-51 Concealment Team to contain or eliminate the threat.\\n  \\n Date: 1927/4/10 \\n Response Team: MSF Zulu-1 \\n Subject: Battle Creek Sanitarium \\n Squad Leads: Z1/1 - Captain Rochne Callahan, Z1/2 - Lieutenant Michael Johnson \\n Foreword: MSF Zulu-1 consists of two 5-man squads each tasked with a different objective.

How much further Three? \\n Z1/3: That door right up there should be Wing K. \\n Squad 2: \\n Z1/2: Keep an eye out, we should be getting close. \\n Z1/7: One more broad asks to touch my johnson and I\\'ll be half inclined to let \\'em. \\n Z1/10: About the only way you\\'ll see any action at all. \\n [Laughter.] \\n Z1/8: Woah, hold it guys– we\\'re here. See, \"Female Staff Dormitories.\" Fettle should be through here. \\n Z1/2: Nine, Ten you stay here and guard the door. Everyone else on me. \\n [Moaning and the sound of bed frames squeezing can be heard.] \\n Z1/8: We got 3 civilia– Christ.

Of the 286 civilians within the sanitarium, 192 survived with 161 listed as injured casualties. Amongst the survivors both SCP-5208-Ω and Mr. Kellogg survived, with SCP-5208-Ω sustaining irreparable brain damage during the event. MSF Zulu-1 was able to recover Captain Vanholt, Agent Fettle, SCP-5208-1, and several documents relating to GOI-5208SD9. All survivors and civilian witnesses were amnestisized and Cover Story-BK79 (Faulty Gas Valve) was enacted. \\n Due to SCP-5208-Ω\\'s brain damage and in accordance with the Foundation agreement with Mr. Kellogg, SCP-5208-Ω was administered YM-Grade amnestics and released into the custody of Mr. Kellogg. All public information pertaining to SCP-5208-Ω\\'s involvement with GOI-5208SD was destroyed or confiscated. In return, Mr. Kellogg transferred a 10% holding of The Kellogg Company to the Foundation. \\n  \\n  \\n « SCP-5207 | SCP-5208 | SCP-5209 »\"', 'SCP-5328': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-5328 \\n Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5328 is to be contained in a cryogenic preservation tank,1 with the ability to be removed and thawed for testing. During observation periods, hallways may be open for use in navigation tests, following and preceding decontamination of floors and walls, but all doors must remain locked, and all unrelated staff must evacuate any rooms or corridors potentially being used by SCP-5328. \\n Although SCP-5328’s affliction does not appear to be directly transmittable, the villages of Faro and Norman Wells must be covertly monitored in the event that a second instance manifests. \\n SCP-5328 shortly after acquisition \\n Description: SCP-5328 is the corpse of an Inuit woman, initially discovered partly frozen in Yukon Territory, 30\\xa0km from the village of Faro. Judging by the bodily anatomy, the subject appears to have been 7-8 months pregnant at time of death, however, surgical investigation has revealed no presence of fetal tissue or fetal remains. \\n SCP-5328 is bisected in a jagged pattern approximately 6\\xa0cm below the naval. Appearance of the torn flesh suggests that the subject was forcibly ripped in half by a pulling or stretching motion, rather than being cut with any type of incision. There are no scars or markings on the limbs or head to indicate that the bisection was made by an external force. \\n Cellular analysis of the top half of the body, including head, arms, and upper torso, reveals no living tissue of any form. MRI scans and surgical analysis have shown that all internal organs are mostly intact, save for the colon and the enlarged uterus, which are torn along the margin of bisection. MRI scans reveal that the brain is 0.32\\xa0kg lighter than what would be considered normal for a human of the subject’s body type. The loss in mass comes primarily from shrunken portions in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and hippocampus. \\n Analysis of the corpse\\'s lower half reveals an abnormally large quantity of overactive nervous tissue ostensibly overtaking and controlling the dead muscular tissue. While thawed, the neurons present throughout SCP-5328 undergo rapid growth, slowly consuming the dead tissue, primarily in the bones. These use strong electrical charges to manipulate the muscles into convulsive contraction and retraction. The neurons will repair or replace the torn muscles at a rapid pace, but the bones and ligaments continue to degrade, often breaking or dislocating. Though its movements are often erratic, SCP-5328 is capable of notable feats of navigation, as it was able to travel several kilometers through the snow in Yukon territory towards Faro, where it was first reported, then return to its top half, where the Foundation first made acquisition (see Addendum 5328-A for further examples). \\n DNA analysis reveals that the active neurons are human cells and are a match to DNA taken from both halves of the corpse. Since they consume mostly non-muscular flesh, tests have been performed to determine if they behave similarly to flesh eating bacteria. Samples were applied, in order, to dead human tissue from volunteers, live tissue from animals, including rats and geckos, and live tissue from two class-D personnel. In all instances, the neuron samples died after a period of six hours, while the test subjects remained unchanged. The current hypothesis is that this nervous tissue only consumes flesh with matching DNA, which it converts into electricity. \\n Because SCP-5328’s life depends on the presence of its own tissue to consume, its lifespan is extremely short; estimated to be approximately two months of cumulative time spent unfrozen, starting at the time this file is written. It is estimated that enough tissue will have been consumed in the first cumulative month that it will effectively deflate in shape and its motion will be hindered beyond function. Therefore, SCP-5328 must remain frozen in order to drastically slow the rate of decomposition, and any time spent studying SCP-5328 when thawed must be greatly limited in order to preserve the specimen for as long as possible. \\n Addendum 5328-A: Third observation session audio recording \\n  \\n This is Dr. Alistair Bosco, I’m making an audio recording of this observation session with— \\n [Metallic banging can be heard from inside the freezer unit] \\n Um, with SCP-5328, as the last two sessions have been, ah, rather eventful. It moves relatively quickly so I’d like to record my thoughts at each moment before I make a write-up. As you can likely hear, the temperature in the freezer has been increased to fifteen degrees Celcius, so the specimen is thawed at this point, and it’s already active. I am now opening the door and letting it out. \\n [Dr. Bosco can be heard unlatching the locks on the freezer and opening the door] \\n Come on out now. Come on. You were so active just a minute ago, why aren’t you moving? Come on. \\n [There is a rapid skittering noise, a brief silence, then a crack] \\n Oh, um, so the first thing it did after exiting the freezer was to bend, or, hyperextend its left knee. It came out very quickly, like it wasn’t just frozen for days. I’m—It’s now trying to turn itself over. I can’t tell if— Wait. \\n [More light cracking can be heard, followed by a thud] \\n My god, is it trying to stand up? This hasn’t happened before, normally it just crawls but this time it actually pushed itself up with both feet, one of which is bent to face the opposite direction, and tried to stabilize itself. If there are portions of the hippocampus still alive in there, maybe it’s remembering how to walk. It’s almost like a toddler learning to walk and falling on its behind, which is— Oh! \\n [Dr. Bosco is heard jumping out of the way as SCP-5328 crawls past him] \\n Okay, it’s moving into walls, trying to crawl up them. It’s now crawling across the floor to the west wall. This is what I was expecting. It’s… Yes, it moved to the doorway and is kicking at the door. I’m not sure if it understands what a doorknob is. It’s hard to believe it can understand anything at all, but somehow in both of my last sessions, it tried to exit through the west door. I’ve already evacuated the hallways and had them disinfected in preparation for this. I’m going to— \\n [A clap is heard] \\n Ow, stop that! Ow, ow, stop, stop, get off, jeez! Ha, um, it can’t hear me but, uh, but I’m opening the door now. Okay, it’s attempting to navigate, or rather, what I currently hypothesize is navigating, through the halls. It’s mostly just brushing up against the walls and crashing into it blindly. It seems to be trying to climb up one of them, but it’s just falling over. \\n [A crack is heard] \\n And it’s breaking its right tibia and fibula to bend itself to reach the ground with its foot. I doubt that will heal since it’s the first time I’ve seen it do that. This worries me if it continues to break its own bones. Soon there’ll be nothing left of it. It’s moving along the hallway now. Looks like it got its bearings. It’s at the north exit door. It’s banging on it like it did with the lab door. I wonder if it knows that that’s the exit leading outside. Maybe it feels the air coming from outside. Um, I can’t let it out, but it seems insistent that it be released through this door. Maybe it’s trying to migrate north, as strange as it—Whoa! \\n [Rapid skittering is heard increasing in volume, then decreasing as Dr. Bosco jumps against a wall] \\n That’s the fastest I’ve ever seen it move, with a broken leg hanging off of it, no less. It’s apparently done trying to escape. Hold on. Okay, I’m back at the lab entrance. It made its way back shockingly quickly and has entered its freezer unit. This is how it usually ends our sessions; it crawls back into the container and aligns itself with its top half, sort of like a puzzle piece. So now it’s lying still, like it’s pretending to be a single body that hasn’t been torn in half. It knows that the rest of its body is there. I still can’t quite explain it, but given how damaged it’s becoming, I worry it won’t be much longer before the bones are essentially nonexistent and it ends up wriggling like a worm. It’s done for the day, I won’t force it to stay out. \\n [Dr. Bosco can be heard crouching and placing his hands on the freezer door] \\n Wait, did it just… Hang on, I’m going to look more closely. I probably shouldn’t be sticking my head in here, but I don’t think it’ll harm me… It… No, never mind. I thought I saw the arm move. Maybe the legs just moved and blocked the light shining on it. \\n [Dr. Bosco can be heard locking the freezer] \\n That was a quick session but I’ve gathered a little more information. It definitely has a desire to escape the facility. I’m not sure why, but I fear with its short lifespan and the impossibility of allowing it to leave the facility that we may never find out. I’m keeping it frozen for as long as I can. I think some other hypothesis needs to be made regarding what’s causing these phenomena before we can risk any further tests on it. \\n Addendum 5328-B:\\nAfter Dr. Bosco’s audio recording was submitted, several researchers pointed out the presence of an indiscriminate noise that occurred at the 4:57 mark as he closed the door to the freezer at the end of the session. Most speculated the sound was a vocalization made by SCP-5328, possibly as a result of the legs transferring neurons to the mouth and vocal cords via physical connection. Dr. Bosco claimed he did not hear this during the observation session, but turned off SCP-5328’s freezer unit and installed an audio recorder in case any similar noises were made. The following audio clips were recorded over the course of two weeks. \\n 1/15/21\\xa04:54 PM: \\n  \\n 1/19/21\\xa05:20 AM: \\n  \\n 1/20/21\\xa012:58 AM: \\n  \\n 1/24/21\\xa07:02 PM: \\n  \\n Addendum 5328-C:\\nIn an attempt to identify the corpse, inquiries have been made about missing person reports in Alaska and the Canadian territories. The only report found that nearly matches SCP-5328 originates from Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, over 400\\xa0km from where SCP-5328 was acquired. The report was made five days after the acquisition of SCP-5328, by the father of 30-year-old Lana Qarpik, when her vehicle, rented from Yellowknife Airport, was discovered abandoned 100\\xa0km from the border of British Columbia. Files were confiscated from the local medical office and Lana Qarpik’s home in hopes confirming SCP-5328’s identity and determining the cause of its affliction. \\n Ultrasound files for Lana Qarpik during pregnancy \\n Date: 8/3/20\\nGestational age: ~15 wks\\nSex: unidentified\\nCardiac activity: present\\nStructures visualized: skull, neck, heart, spine\\nHead circumference: 126\\xa0mm\\nVisit summary:\\nAll readings normal.\\nPatient is under high distress, claiming she has been abstinent for several years.

Although the quantity of living cells present has not changed, its movement has become noticeably sluggish, and it is unable to stand or reach upwards more than 50\\xa0cm. Moving forward, we will be using cryogenics to preserve SCP-5328. It may only be released if new regenerative technology is developed for it or another separate instance is discovered. \\n To the junior researchers involved with this specimen, especially those for whom this was their first project, first of all, yes, this will likely take a matter of years. Second, any further appeals by staff to satisfy SCP-5328\\'s alleged requests made in Addendum 5328-B will continue to be ignored. The Foundation\\'s living specimens are not pets, and you will need to learn this the hard way if you want to continue to work here. \"What harm would it do?\" is not a valid question. Be aware that this is neither an act of mercy nor cruelty. Anyone who insults me again by referring to this as the latter will be recommended for a project with a high risk rating so that you will better understand why we are doing this. \\n -Dr. Alistair Bosco \\n Incident I-5328-1: \\n Date: 5/21/21\\nLocation: Site 17- West entrance\\nCasualties: 1 \\n Description:\\nAt 3:15 AM, an intruder was detected climbing the outer fence at the facility\\'s west gate. The intruder ignored warnings by security to stop and was gunned down after successfully entering the nine digit passcode to open the west entrance door. The intruder was identified as George Qarpik, 63, of Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, Canada. \\n Because of the intruder\\'s speculated relation to SCP-5328, his remains were given to Dr. Alistair Bosco for DNA sampling before incineration. Dr. Bosco has confirmed that the man was related by blood to SCP-5328. \\n Due to the clear connection between the intruder and an SCP, plus his knowledge of the entrance passcode, the Foundation is thoroughly investigating all staff members who have been involved with SCP-5328 for an intentional information leak. Any staff members with knowledge that may help the investigation are asked to report to upper management. \\n Addendum 5328-E: \\n 7/2/21 \\n Due to the recent happenings in regards to SCP-5328, which I\\'m sure you all have no doubt are related to incident I-5328-1, it is imperative that I share my recent findings with the senior staff involved. Since the information leak from the incident was almost certainly caused by a junior researcher with an unfortunate bleeding heart, who is yet to be identified, I will not be copying any of them on this information, and I recommend anyone reading this message also withhold it from them. \\n Frankly, the appearance of the father of SCP-5328\\'s former self is a blessing in disguise. Thanks to those in upper management who allowed me permission to dissect the corpse, my genetics team and I have isolated at least two abnormally mutated gene strings that both SCP-5328 and its parent possess. Although research is ongoing, they appear to be related to reproductive function and brain function, respectively. This all but confirms that the affliction is hereditary, and not caused by a contagion, as some of us feared. Thus, unless George Qarpik had other offspring that we don\\'t know about (I suggest we make the necessary inquiries to be certain), Lana Qarpik, who we know as SCP-5328, was the only person affected. \\n This brings about my main hypothesis that I\\'d like to share, as I believe it may interest some particularly high ranking researchers. SCP-5328 is not a fluke of nature, but rather an unfathomably rare step in evolution, albeit a flawed one. Had Lana given birth, and not died in the Yukon wilderness, forcing the fetus to devour itself to stay alive, we may have seen the first instance of complete transferal of a person\\'s consciousness to a separate body via natural means. This singular human was genetically designed to shift all of her knowledge and memories to an infantile duplicate of herself, for a potentially indefinite number of generations, effectively making her immortal. If properly harnessed, this genetic pattern could allow a person to keep their knowledge alive for longer than anyone has ever lived. \\n This is certainly a controversial hypothesis for a potential result that would be even more contentious within the science world, but I hope you all understand the importance of keeping SCP-5328 alive, and agree that this creature deserves to be studied further. Obviously, this research would have to be prevented from falling into the wrong hands, so I highly recommend raising the clearance level to at least 3, depending on our future findings. \\n Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing back from all of you. \\n -Dr. Alistair Bosco \\n « SCP-5327 | SCP-5328 | SCP-5329 »\"', 'SCP-5342': '\"This page doesn\\'t exist. \\n This page may have been moved or deleted, or it may have never existed.

Biological matter acquired from SCP-5385 is to be contained within a freezer at -40 degrees celsius. Personnel who enter the hotel are to wear Level-II Hazmat suits and be equipped with an incendiary tool in the event of being caught inside of SCP-5385. \\n Deaths related to SCP-5385 are to be given the cover story under the \"Slasher-no-Slasher\" protocol. \\n Updated: The remains of SCP-5385 and SCP-5385-A are to be stored in Level-I Bio Chambers and may be accessed for research purposes. \\n The Homeburg Hotel and the surrounding buildings are closed off from the public and are currently being investigated for further anomalous activity. \\n Description: \\n SCP-5385 was an approximately 30-meter wide amorphous mass of flesh that was located in the center of the Homeburg Hotel1 in Tampa, Florida, and had spread and embedded itself inside the infrastructure of the building around it. SCP-5385 is composed entirely of human skeletal smooth and striated tissue, with patches of bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus tissue being found in small quantities throughout it even after its neutralization. In its center, was a 5-meter-wide mass of functional cardiac tissue in the shape of a human heart and had a heart rate of 120 times per minute. SCP-5385 was capable of locomotion and had the ability to compressed and elongate its mass. \\n Throughout SCP-5385\\'s mass were the cadavers of 45 humans, 16 domestic canines, and 20 domestic felines. The cadavers\\' biological matter were structurally merged with SCP-5385\\'s mass to the point where fully intact removal is impossible. Tumors in the shape of human heads were present on every cadaver. These tumors possessed facial features that appeared to be grinning with their eyes rolled back. All lacerations and injuries made to SCP-5385 and the attached cadavers rapidly regenerate. It is theorized that the corpses within the mass of SCP-5385 were trapped inside it after its sudden formation and died of suffocation, as its mass covering their abdomens would have prevented airflow. \\n SCP-5385-A is was an unknown entity with similar composition to SCP-5385. It was purplish in coloration, with its epidermis being covered in a viscous, mucus-like substance. SCP-5385-A\\'s origins are currently unknown and its connection to SCP-5385 as well. \\n An investigation into the Homeburg Hotel revealed that 8 weeks before the appearance of SCP-5385, several letters from a person self-identifying as Douglas Lamb were sent to it to an unknown individual. Transcripts of them are provided below. \\n My love! It tears my heart to know that I can not feel and caress your tender and plump body of my every waking moment.

To feel every curve of your soft, glorious body. \\n I know you have watched me as I watch you, and that you feel the same way. For that very reason, I cannot be an admirer any longer. I must be with you. Dream of me as you sleep, as I will dream of you. \\n I write this missive to you in time of my euphoria. I admit I thought of you constantly as I committed the act. I have no shame in telling you this, for you belong to me as I belong to you. Yes! I cannot say or write that enough. I have loved you since I was just a lad. How I watched and released myself of tension for many hours in my early youth. \\n I remind myself every morning how blessed I am to be able to see you. No one else could but me, not even the old man, who claims to be your father. Which I find prosperous, something so beautiful can never spawn from such a wicked, vile being. My Grandfather always told me I was special, that I was bestowed a gift from God. \\n But I don\\'t care about that, I\\'ll trade it all if I could be with you. So now, as I reached the height of my adulthood, I wish for you to give me a sign of your affection towards me. I cannot make the move in person unless I know for sure you are ready. I am a gentleman, not a thug. \\n I will wait outside. Watching. \\n A few hours ago I was just chased and yelled at by the Old Man to get away from you. Why? Have I done something wrong? Have I not been celibate for all these years just for you? Have I not been faithful? Then why? Only you could have known I will be there. You called him. You called that old buffon to cast me out of your presence and into the mud as if I was a Beef-head! I could have killed him with a thought, but I didn\\'t out of respect for you. But yet, you knew that, and still sent him. \\n How dare you! I\\'m your only true lover. Your only friend. Your soulmate. You cannot abandon me like I\\'m second rate. Ycan\\'t Ilve you I love [Unintelligible Writing] \\n ….and if you do choose that route then so be it! I will give my love to someone of higher class. I don\\'t need you, nor will I ever!! \\n Forgive me. I acted like a child. You did not cast me beside out of malice, but out of love. Your love is not like mine, no. It is a more mature, refined one. You wanted to test me to see if I could court you, and I failed; miserably. \\n You want a strong, reliable man. Not a wispy-washy weak, effeminate one. A man\\'s man, one that would be the foundation of your body and take control of the situation. Yes! I would prove myself for you. My grandfather told me many times I came from a line of great men. Powerful individuals that once made inferior specimen quake from the mention of their name. I have that power too, he always said, to make wishes into reality. Maybe that\\'s how I found you, I wanted to find someone as perfect as you. I must go back to my roots so I can lead us further into our future. \\n I will return in a fortnight. And when I do, I will be a man worthy of your love! \\n I have climbed the tallest mountain and traveled the twelve seas. I have seen my true nature and scoffed in its face. I rebuked it, ate it, and excreted it from my vessel. The only thing that remains is me, power, and my ever-lasting adoration for you. \\n That mind. That body. That soul. Everything you are is mine, and everything I am is yours. Forever and ever. Our souls will be fused into one being and I will know everything you are. I will think your thoughts. I will become them. Every movement, every laugh, every molecule on your body will be as if it was my own. I have found the wheel to turn these gears made out of love into reality! \\n Yes! \\n The time has come! Tomorrow, we will be one! \\n 18 hours after this letter was delivered to the local authorities, an unidentified man entered the Homeburg Hotel naked. Several hours after this, reports of a flesh hive were reported to the local authorities in the area and Foundation agents were deployed to asset the situation. The agents then found a large amount of bio-mass that would later be classified as SCP-5385 and set up a perimeter under an ammonia leak cover story. \\n SCP-5385 Incident-001: \\n On February 14th, 2004, SCP-5385 began to show signs of vertical movement beneath its surface; its center, the heart, also began to rapidly beat. Several seconds later, it began to transform. \\n [BEGIN LOG] \\n [00:00]2 SCP-5385\\'s lower parts begin to twist and elongate, with ossification being observed within its crevices at the same time. The upper section also begins going through a similar process. \\n [00:04] The upper and lower sections of SCP-5385 begin to resemble humanoid arms and legs and attempt to move. As it tries to stand with its legs, it uses its arms to grab the structure to support itself but is inhibited by its sagging mass. Simultaneously, the flesh of the cadavers trapped within SCP-5385 begins to pull away from their bodies and fuse with the main mass; all that is left are bones. This new mass travels beneath the skin of SCP-5385 and convulse until it starts to compress on itself, giving the mass the shape of a humanoid. \\n [00:08] SCP-5385 latches onto the roof with its arms as its legs dangle in the air and swings in a back and forth motion before letting go of the roof, and falling into the lobby of the Homeburg Hotel, destroying four floors in the process and causing pieces of wood and concrete to erupt beneath its feet. \\n [00:12] Hundreds of faces bearing the same expression as the tumors on the cadavers appear on the skin of SCP-5385 as the entity begins to dig into the floor of the hotel lobby. Once SCP-5385 has ceased digging, a large crevice in the floor is seen. A loud, wet noise, similar to meat being slapped on stone, is heard from this crevice when a purplish, cone-shaped mass of flesh emerges from it, hereby designated as SCP-5385-A. SCP-5385-A\\'s surface then splits open into four sections, revealing a pink tube, and vocalizes \"YOU WILL BECOME UNTO ME, AS I WILL BE UNTO YOU.\" \\n [00:16] SCP-5385\\'s skin ruptures, causing the tumors to fall off its body and shrivel into an atrophied state. Cone-shaped masses then begin to grow and take their place where the tumors once were as they release large amounts of white foam. \\n [00:20] A head begins to rapidly form at the top of SCP-5385\\'s section as a nose, a pair of eyes, ears, and a mouth takes shape. The face then mimics the expression found on the tumors and enters, head first, into SCP-5385-A, causing foam to overflow from inside it. SCP-5385 then vocalizes, albeit muffled due to its head being inside SCP-5385-A, \"TO THE END OF TIME. TOGETHER FOREVER.\" Unidentifiable noises are heard for several minutes before SCP-5385 and SCP-5385-A both begin to vibrate and eventually combust. \\n [END LOG] \\n After this event, SCP-5385 and SCP-5385-A were both reclassified as neutralized. \\n Timmy Orseworth\\'s Statement: \\n The former owner of the Homeburge Hotel, Timmy Orseworth, gave a statement regarding the letters from PoI-584 to the local authorities before SCP-5385\\'s formation. An excerpt was retrieved and is provided below. \\n I\\'m telling you, you need to find that kid. Fucking weirdo. I swear to God he isn\\'t right in the head. He talks in this strange way and never looks you in the eye either. I keep telling people to keep their kids away from that television. And when they start looking at me like I\\'m crazy, I take them by the arm and point at him! Then I say, \"That\\'s what happens when you let television raise your kids\". They listen after that. That they do. \\n Proof? What other proof do you want? I gave you the letters, didn\\'t I? He\\'s not mentally sound, put him in a straight coat or something. I don\\'t care what you do just keep him away. Why didn\\'t any woman come to you? Cause there isn\\'t one. That boy doesn\\'t want a woman or a man. In fact, he doesn\\'t want any human. \\n Let me tell you something. A year after I had my Hotel built, I saw that punk wandering around the building every single day. Raining, cold, or hot, it didn\\'t matter. He was determined to be out there no matter what. One day I decided to see what the fuck is his problem and found him in the act. Motherfucker had his dick rubbing against the wall of my building! \\n That boy don\\'t want no woman. He wants that building. \\n « SCP-5384 | SCP-5385 | SCP-5386 »\"', 'SCP-5444': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-5444 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n ⚠️ Content warning: This article contains suicide and survival sex work. \\n  \\n ⚠️ content warning   \\n Threat Level: Blue \\n Special Containment Procedures: Antivirus software in use by the Foundation is to be capable of identifying and blocking requests from SCP-5444. Furthermore, all information relating to SCP-5444-4 is to be backed-up through at least two network-inaccessible mediums. \\n Instances of SCP-5444-1 are to be stored, unpowered, in an electromagnetically-shielded storage locker. Experimentation, when applicable, is to be conducted under similar conditions, and instances may not be connected to the Site-56 intranet without approval and supervision from the IT Department. \\n Several instances of SCP-5444-2 are uncontained; Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") has been tasked with locating and disabling rogue instances of SCP-5444-2. \\n SCP-5444-3 is to be kept disassembled and stored in the High Value Containment Wing of Site-56. \\n Description: SCP-5444 is a series of malware programmed in the Yashagorō paralanguage. Metadata analysis has returned largely inconclusive results; it is known that SCP-5444 is 1.32i GB in size at most, although metadata relating to its creation and ownership has been extensively obfuscated. The most recent iteration of SCP-5444 was last modified on January 9th, 2018 at 16:15 EST. \\n Three variations of SCP-5444 are known to exist, each of which is associated with a specific hardware environment. \\n When connected to either a database or computer network, SCP-5444 functions as an effectively sapient user. SCP-5444\\'s primary activities are initially limited to accessing and analyzing as much data as possible; upon the confirmation of data referenced in SCP-5444-4, SCP-5444 will attempt to remove such data through any means necessary. \\n All variations of SCP-5444 reference SCP-5444-4 through a series of anomalous pointer variables2. SCP-5444-4 is a file stored on SCP-5444-1-Prime with a .rysh extension, serving as the primary method of setting SCP-5444\\'s censorship parameters. Modification of SCP-5444-4 first requires the user to undergo a three-factor authentication process to confirm they are PoI-9522-D. \\n PoI-9522-D was Sara Miriam Yarkoni, a 29-year-old Iranian-American freelance programmer with connections to GoI-1285 (\"The King of Hearts Collective\")3. According to data recovered from SCP-5444-1-Prime, PoI-9522-D was the sole programmer of SCP-5444-1. \\n At present, SCP-5444-4 directs SCP-5444 to erase all evidence of PoI-9522-D\\'s existence. \\n HISTORY \\n SCP-5444\\'s existence was brought to the attention of the Foundation on January 10th, 2018, following a string of attacks targeting several individuals of various backgrounds. Although coordinated in such a manner as to suggest a botnet, several attacks displayed unusual complexity. Attacks included, but were not limited to: \\n Shortly thereafter, Senior Researcher Yehezkel Yarkoni received an email, purportedly from his daughter Sara. Attached was a PDF, ostensibly a handwritten letter, infected with an SCP-5444-2 installer.4 \\n Following its installation, SCP-5444-2-1 launched a series of attacks directed at personnel assigned to the GoI-1285 project, as well as Researcher Yarkoni and his wife, Dr. Rivka Yarkoni. Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") was directed to identify, combat, and isolate the threat. \\n SCP-5444-2-1 was subsequently isolated and neutralized by MTF-κ10 after two hours and fourteen minutes. Researcher Yarkoni was reprimanded for his carelessness and reassigned to Area-56 duty. \\n DOCUMENT 5444-A \\n In accordance with the 1966 SoHo Accord, the Foundation required a warrant to raid the residences of PoI-9522-D, on account of her fiance\\'s registration as a Frequent Resident of BackDoor SoHo. Furthermore, action on part of the Foundation was limited to assisting attendant Unusual Incidents Unit operatives. \\n [DATA LOST] \\n Following the acquisition of SCP-5444-3 and all four instances of SCP-5444-1, each of their drives were isolated and imaged, as standard for computer anomalies. According to imaging software, all files pertaining to PoI-9522-D had been deleted at 16:15:54 EST on 10/01/2018, 24 hours after the last modification to SCP-5444-4; as no action had been taken to wipe the associated data, files were successfully restored with minimal effort. \\n Of interest to the Foundation were several video files recorded on SCP-5444-1-Prime, in which PoI-9522-D discusses the function and background of SCP-5444, as well as updates as appropriate. The last of such videos was recorded at 16:17 EST on 09/01/2018, 19 minutes prior to her estimated time of death. \\n Excerpted video logs have been provided below. The original files, as well as full transcripts, may be accessed with permission from RAISA; personnel are to be advised of their sexually explicit nature. \\n Length 0:28:19 \\n [BEGIN LOG 2.1] \\n PoI-9522-D: Heya! Thanks for buying my content, ya little devil! \\n PoI-9522-D blows a kiss to the camera, then winks. \\n PoI-9522-D: If you\\'re wondering why this came with your purchase, think of this like, well, a EULA. Obviously this is gonna be sexier than reading an EULA, but it still concerns a lot of technical and legal bullshit, and I know not all of you are here for my coding stuff. Bear with me, I\\'m gonna try making this the easiest EULA possible. \\n Turning around, PoI-9522-D makes a show of walking to an office chair in the middle of the room, then settling into it with a relaxed position perpendicular to the backrest. \\n PoI-9522-D: So, you\\'re the proud owner of one of my videos, albums, et cetera. That entitles you to several legal rights. First of all, you are entitled to watch it. You are more than welcome to watch it. \\n PoI-9522-D chuckles, winks, and begins to slowly unbutton her jacket. \\n PoI-9522-D: Secondly, you\\'re entitled to download it to any device you own. Do with that whatever the hell you wish, dear. So, what can\\'t you do? \\n PoI-9522-D: Well, you can\\'t upload it anywhere else. Much as I love showing myself off, a girl\\'s gotta keep work-work and play-work separate. Coming off of that, you can\\'t bring the real me into BabylonShedim\\'s5 domain, and trust me, I\\'ll know. Third, and this is one goes out to \"pink fly\", you cannot show any of this to anyone who doesn\\'t need to know. Again, darling, I\\'ll know. \\n PoI-9522-D: So, let me be one hundred percent transparent: those files are a bit of an experiment. They\\'re a bit smarter than your typical file, so in addition to carrying the image of me fucking myself raw, they\\'re a bit shy when it comes to distribution. So, how does this all work? \\n Unfastening the last button, PoI-9522-D pauses, then smirks. \\n PoI-9522-D: Let\\'s peel back the veil a little. \\n [END LOG 2.1] \\n Note: Video appears to be a collaboration with PoI-CBGC103 (\"K4m3ra\"), a webcam model and practicing Maxwellist. \\n Length 1:01:32 \\n [BEGIN LOG 9.4] \\n PoI-CBGC103\\'s ventral circuitry is presently exposed as PoI-9522-D performs a ritualized maintenance upon it.

Just, all the effort that went into… this. All the work that had to have gone into the programming, or the licensing, or even the documentation. I\\'ve known witnesses to the Signal who could learn from your example. \\n PoI-9522-D: Oh. Yeah, this shit\\'s been a hobby my whole life. Glad you like me for my brains, cutie. \\n PoI-CBGC103: A hobby? You could be the woman the next Bill Gates backstabs. \\n PoI-9522-D remains silent for several seconds. Her shoulders slouch. Finally, after fifteen seconds, PoI-9522-D leans down to kiss PoI-CBGC103. \\n PoI-9522-D: That\\'s enough boring our fans. \\n PoI-9522-D resumes the ritualized maintenance. \\n [END LOG 9.4] \\n Note: Video appears to have been recorded during a livestream. \\n Length 2:38:13 \\n [BEGIN LOG 12.2] \\n PoI-9522-D, dressed in a \"sexy teacher\" outfit, gives a lecture to her digital audience in apparent earnest regarding updates to SCP-5444, complete with a dry-erase whiteboard.

Second, from Hung-er, very clever: \"When will BookBurn\\'t come out?\" When it\\'s done. And finally… \\n PoI-9522-D trails off, before putting her face in her hands. After several seconds, PoI-9522-D looks back up at the camera. \\n PoI-9522-D: Look, it\\'s… I don\\'t have a past I can point to. I have five years of my life I can point to where I\\'m doing what I\\'m doing now, more or less, shit I\\'m doing to keep myself off the streets and out of the psych ward. And you know, maybe there\\'s something I can sift through, a GitHub or every barely-legal website I coded half-naked in my room. But I\\'m also a college… dropout with too much baggage.

That sounds frustrating. \\n PoI-9522-D: It\\'s cool, babe, it\\'s cool. \\n PoI-9522-D turns back to her bed, retrieving the bong on her counter. \\n Kawajiri: It doesn\\'t feel… again, sorry.

From 1879 to 1942, they are addressed to a “Saarin Llovi”, then “Saally Orock” until 1979, “Sandy Nadocks” up to 2017 and from that point forward, “Saara Klaviger”. \\n There is a photorealistic painting on the bedside table depicting a young woman and an older man, likely in his thirties, standing in front of a field of red grass. A faded inscription on the bottom of the frame reads “εγώ και ιόν”, translatable from Greek as “Me and Ion” (sic). Dating of the pigments has revealed it to be around 3,100 years old. \\n SCP-5480 is inhabited by PoI-595, the aforementioned Saara Klaviger. PoI-595 is, according to her passport, a 28 year old female currently employed as a retail assistant of the Aldi brand grocery chain. \\n Addendum 5480.1 - Discovery \\n On the 15th of May, 2020, two members of GoI-663, “The Fraternity of Skin”, to whom Foundation agents had attached hidden observation devices to weeks prior, had the following conversation outside of what was later found out to be SCP-5480. \\n Interlocutors: Saara Klaviger (PoI-595), Male 1, Male 2 \\n (Begin transcript) \\n [Male 1 knocks on Klaviger’s door. Half a minute later, she opens it.] \\n Male 1: Good morning, ma’am! It’s so good to see you, it’s hard to find fellow disciples of the flesh. \\n Male 2: We represent the Fraternity of Skin, one of the last remaining groups in Europe who champion the original goals of the Grand Karcist. \\n Klaviger: Uh huh, and what would those be? \\n Male 1: In his words, ‘the liberation of mankind from the fetters of machinery’. \\n Klaviger: He never said that. The actual quote goes: ‘from the fetters of mortality’. \\n Male 2: How would you know? \\n Klaviger: You know what, nevermind. What else is your cult about? \\n Male 1: Not a cult! Not a cult. We’re a society of revivalists, bringing Sarkicism back to its roots. We worship Yaldabaoth, our deliverer from iron. \\n Klaviger: What are you talking about? Ion fought Yaldabaoth, they are- were legendary enemies. Classical Nälkänism rejects the idea of worship of the gods entirely. And \"sarkic\" is a slur, the proper term is Nälkän. \\n Male 1: You’re misinformed. Just take a look at our scripture, the Parables of Nadox. We pulled this from the library’s shelves ourselves. \\n Klaviger: Pseudo-Nadox. And this isn’t even a copy of the original, what is this? “Ion drew forth the seed of his loins and placed it into Lovataar’s gaping…” ugh, this is just an erotica. These aren’t even parables! And I never want to hear about any of Lovataar’s body parts again, gaping or not. \\n Male 2: Those are our holy texts! \\n Male 1: (Whispering: Shush, we can still recover this). There’s always time to debate the historicity of our practices later. However, I’m sure that you will agree that the spirit of our group, nay, our family, is truly in the vein of the original brand of Sarkicism. \\n Klaviger: Oh boy. \\n Male 1: Take a look at this. [He produces a clay sculpture packed with cotton.] \\n Klaviger: Serpent’s tail, many eyes, is that… Saarn? \\n Male 1: Yes. She is the object of our affections. \\n Klaviger: A-affections? \\n Male 2: That’s right. You see, as with most Sarkites, we try to keep our bloodline pure. No breeding or marriage with outsiders, we only procreate with fellow members of our community. But we don’t have any proselytes who can carry a child yet so in the meantime we’ve been storing our seed in these clay receptacles. \\n Male 1: (Whispering: No! Don’t start with that!) It also serves a dual purpose. We follow in Ion’s footsteps, for just as he laid with Saarn for twelve days and shattered the hills with his passion- \\n Klaviger: [Chokes.] Fucking… no! That didn\\'t happen! Ion was faithful to Lovataar, how did Saarn somehow get roped into a relationship with him? I did not want to learn today that effigies of me- I mean Saarn were being violated by a bunch of crusty old men! How come every Nälkän commune is some kind of disgusting sex cult!? \\n Male 1: It\\'s in following with our founder\\'s principles. Ion’s appetites were legendary, it’s said he fornicated with so many that his phallus spat blood by the time he was thirty! \\n Klaviger: [Vomits profusely.] \\n (End of transcript) \\n « SCP-5479 | SCP-5480 | SCP-5481 »\"', 'SCP-5488': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-5488 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n SCP-5488: \"Ratings That Stick\"\\nThe only way to be sure. \\n nickthebrick1!\\nand\\nHarryBlank! \\n  \\n To: ten.34|nnaCsalohciN#ten.34|nnaCsalohciN\\nFrom: ten.34|yarDneleH#ten.34|yarDneleH\\nSubject: SCP-5488 documentation \\n Dr. Cann, \\n Congratulations on being promoted to project lead.

The lock combination must be changed every two weeks. Interaction is restricted to Clearance Level-2 and above. \\n The Research and Experimentation Section of Site-43 is presently soliciting testing proposals for SCP-5488. Contact Dr. Nicholas Cann for details. \\n Description: SCP-5488 is a set of eight custom-made stickers (designated SCP-5488-A through H) resembling film industry rating labels. No physical anomalies beyond the failure to lose adhesive properties after multiple uses and extreme resistance to damage have been observed. \\n When an instance of SCP-5488 is placed onto any form of media (movies, books, video games etc.) the physical appearance and contents of the media will be altered drastically, corresponding to the SCP-5488 instance. Examples of alterations include: \\n All effects are instantaneously reversed with the removal of the SCP-5488 instance. \\n The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-5488 when user \"falcon_crazy\" of the conspiracy forum Parawatch claimed to own something \"legit magical.\" The user supposedly discovered a set of anomalous rating stickers while performing spring cleaning in an under-the-stairs closet. MTF Kappa-43 (\"The Mediators\") recovered SCP-5488 and amnesticized its former owner, while the Identity and Technocryptography Section of Site-43 deleted the relevant forum posts. \\n Addendum 5488-1, Abridged Testing Log: To access complete logs, contact Dr. Nicholas Cann. \\n To: ten.34|nnaCsalohciN#ten.34|nnaCsalohciN\\nFrom: ten.34|yarDneleH#ten.34|yarDneleH\\nSubject: RE: SCP-5488 documentation \\n Dr Cann, \\n If you want to bring snacks, then just say it.

𝒫 is aware that Ms. Yore\\'s knowledge of the situation is incomplete, and has thus far been able to adapt to Foundation efforts consistently. \\n Description: 𝒫 (formerly Nudah Borvitch) is an 18-year-old human with a drastically disparate cranial structure when compared with the average individual. 𝒫\\'s otherwise standard human body leads into a fleshy, conical neck supporting a gargantuan head with 50-100 small orifices composed of various facial tissues including skin, cartilage, adipose, and bone. These orifices are largely symmetrical, with minor discrepancies across the midline of the face, and are in a constant state of flux, having new ones generated while the cranial flesh simultaneously absorbs existing ones. \\n 𝒫 also refers to the word \"𝒫\", which displays a number of memetic qualities with regards to its transmission, both auditory and visual. 𝒫, the individual, cannot be referred to by any name or direct identifier other than \"𝒫\". When written or otherwise transferred visually, all direct reference to 𝒫 is limited to the word \"𝒫\". However, when spoken, the word is pronounced identically to a separate word from the English language. A spoken rendition of the word \"𝒫\" may be heard below. \\n  \\n Addendum 01 - Interview (02-17-19) \\n Foreword: 𝒫\\'s facial abnormality was discovered when a video entitled \"Kid With Liquid Mouth\" gained notable popularity on the internet. 𝒫 was quickly located and determined to be suffering from an anomalous condition. The following interview took place a week after 𝒫\\'s initial habituation into Site-96. \\n Dr. Ozid enters the room and sits down. \\n Dr. Ozid: Hi 𝒫. \\n 𝒫: Hey. \\n Dr. Ozid: Obviously I don\\'t want to make this any more of a burden on you than the situation already is, so I\\'ll try to keep it as brief as possible. \\n 𝒫: Well, yeah… I mean, well no, it\\'s fine, I honestly want to understand this as much as you do so, like, it\\'s fine. \\n Dr. Ozid: I appreciate the sentiment. Now, just to begin, I\\'ll start chronologically. What was the first time you noticed weird things happening? \\n 𝒫: Well, I didn\\'t think it was weird at the time, but the first time somebody called me 𝒫 was… like, I was eleven, I think. It was actually an insult originally, one of the kids in my class called me it just because I was wearing pink socks. Which, you know, doesn\\'t mean anything, I just liked the color at the time. I don\\'t, now. I mean… I don\\'t. \\n Dr. Ozid: At the time, did you think anything of it? I know you said you didn\\'t think it was strange, but did you have any sort of emotional reaction? \\n 𝒫: I mean, I cried and everything but, it was probably more that I was being made fun of than the actual contents of the bullying. I didn\\'t mind the name at all, in fact, when I came back to school the next day and everyone was calling me 𝒫, I sort of… liked it, kinda. Better than “Nudah”, anyway. \\n Dr. Ozid: When did you notice that it was becoming more than a nickname? \\n 𝒫: The thing is, I sort of didn’t, no one did. I mean, I thought it was weird that teachers, my parents, the principal, were all using my nickname, but I never thought it was, you know, weird like it is now. \\n Dr. Ozid: When did it start to progress in severity? \\n 𝒫: Well, so, it was actually like three and a half years before my head started getting, you know, fatter. I one hundred percent thought it was just self hatred until people started telling me to see a doctor. I was in the hospital for a few days before I… started growing noses and stuff. And that was only like a month ago, everything that\\'s happened since then is relatively new. \\n Dr. Ozid: Are you able to use any of your new facial features? \\n 𝒫: I know the noses are functional and the eyes aren\\'t, and nothing else even looks like a real body part so it beats me. \\n Dr. Ozid: Hmm, so that covers my checklist, but I wanted to ask, how are you feeling? \\n 𝒫: I mean look, I understand the severity of the situation and I appreciate that you guys aren\\'t sugar coating this. Things are weird, we don\\'t know why, and we\\'re trying to fix it. I get it, and I\\'m here for it. \\n Dr. Ozid: But how are you feeling? Seriously, I mean, if there\\'s anything else we can do to make your time here more comfortable… \\n 𝒫: I\\'m fine, please don\\'t try to make big accommodations for me. I don\\'t want to be a burden, I\\'m doing great here, and I\\'m fine. \\n Dr. Ozid: Alright, well in that case, thanks for talking to me 𝒫. I\\'ll let you know if we discover anything else. \\n Addendum 02 - Interview (07-07-19) \\n Foreword: Objects began manifesting at 02:06:14, while 𝒫 was asleep. The following interview was conducted twelve hours later. \\n 𝒫: Well, the world is ending. \\n Dr. Ozid: Good morning 𝒫. \\n 𝒫: For you maybe. I don\\'t even know what this is, but I just want it to stop. \\n Dr. Ozid: Has this been happening all day? \\n 𝒫: And all of last night, since like 2 in the morning. I haven\\'t slept since it started. \\n Dr. Ozid: What happened, initially? \\n 𝒫: I mean… not really anything, I don\\'t think. One minute I was asleep, and then boom, I get hit in the head with a doorknob. A doorknob! What the hell! \\n Dr. Ozid: We actually ran a number of analyses on the object, but so far, nothing out of the ordinary has been found. \\n 𝒫: How do we even know it came from me? There\\'s tons of weird stuff here, right? \\n A polaroid image of two humans kissing manifests directly in front of 𝒫\\'s face, who grabs it and throws it on the floor. \\n Dr. Ozid: It just seems to be centered around you. \\n 𝒫: Physically, maybe, but certainly not thematically! I mean, I don\\'t even like- look, it\\'s just random stuff. Earlier an empty bottle of Sprite appeared in my hands, I do not drink sugar soda. \\n Dr. Ozid: I understand. At the moment, the best option would be to determine, if possible, the source of these objects, as well as attempting to draw connections between them in case they are some subconscious manifestation- \\n 𝒫: Don\\'t say \"of your desires\". \\n Dr. Ozid: I wasn\\'t planning on it. \\n Update (07-18-19): While conscious, 𝒫 is able to manifest a variety of objects, though this appears to be entirely unintentional on 𝒫\\'s part, both in the frequency and content of the manifestations. Though the objects do not appear to follow any pattern, a number of them have been noted as frequently reoccurring, sometimes multiple times per day. Among them are plush yardsticks, various comics (with a majority being from Action Comics), heated neck pillows, unmarked bottles containing soda, and manila folders containing images of people kissing. \\n Addendum 03 - Interview (11-05-19) \\n Foreword: Notably different objects to the previous manifestations began appearing at 08:14:58, the first instance of which occurred inside the Site-96 integrated cafeteria. The following interview was scheduled by 𝒫, who requested one as soon as it was possible for Dr. Ozid to arrive, which was nearly four hours later. \\n Dr. Ozid: Hey, 𝒫, are you… okay? \\n 𝒫: Pretty fuckin\\' far from it, asshole. \\n Dr. Ozid: Please try to stay civil, 𝒫. \\n 𝒫: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry, just, today has been very stressful. Like, I\\'m eating my breakfast, and boom, dick and balls. The fuck am I supposed to do about that? \\n Dr. Ozid: I understand the concern, we\\'re trying to figure out if anything changed in your diet or habituation but this may just be… well… \\n 𝒫: Another random thing happening in my random fucked up life? \\n Dr. Ozid: Yes, minus the profanity. \\n A concave plastic self-pleasure device manifests on the table. \\n 𝒫: I feel sick. \\n Dr. Ozid: If you don\\'t mind me saying it, you seem a bit off today. \\n 𝒫 grabs the device and waves it in front of Dr. Ozid\\'s face. \\n 𝒫: Gee, I wonder why! \\n Dr. Ozid: If it makes you feel any better, no one is judging you for this. It\\'s just an anomalous event, it isn\\'t your fault. \\n 𝒫: It may not be my fault, but I saw the reactions of everyone this morning. People were doing that fucking wide-eyed thing where they\\'re trying not to react just to make me feel better, when in reality, they think I\\'m a freak! Somehow, even though I eat breakfast with people who have fucking impossible arms and cosmic skin, I\\'m still the freak! And it\\'s like, I know they know it\\'s just a weird anomaly or whatever, but it comes off like I\\'m some sort of superpowered sexual deviant and I hate it, and I know they will never be able to shake the thought from their minds. \\n Dr. Ozid: 𝒫, listen to me. You\\'re right that people will think it\\'s weird, but I promise you, they don\\'t think you are weird. I\\'m sure you\\'ve noticed the red cylinders protruding from my forehead? \\n 𝒫: What about them? \\n Dr. Ozid: I started working at the SCP Foundation when I was 27. When I was 29, I was researching a portal between two nearly identical parallel universes, when the portal irreparably closed, sealing me on the other side. Everything was identical, except for one small issue. Unlike me, humans didn\\'t have these. \\n Dr. Ozid taps his antennae. \\n Dr. Ozid: When I eventually started working here, in this universe\\'s Foundation, I had to deal with glances and tension constantly, but people got used to it, and now I\\'m doing pretty well, socially. \\n 𝒫: Ok, but you have horns and I have like 500 noses and dildos coming out of the fucking sky. There\\'s a difference. \\n Dr. Ozid: Your situation may be more severe than mine, but regardless, it\\'s more about your own self-worth than it is about other peoples\\' judgement, and I can promise you, it will get better. \\n 10 seconds of silence elapse. \\n 𝒫: Okay, fine. Sure. I\\'ll try. \\n Dr. Ozid: I\\'m glad to hear it, 𝒫. I\\'m proud of you. \\n 𝒫: Alright, don\\'t overstay the wholesomeness, this is still fucked up. \\n The table becomes instantaneously covered in a tablecloth, upon which is a patterned image of male genitalia. \\n 𝒫: Case in point. \\n Dr. Ozid: Hey, don\\'t sweat it, I\\'ve seen worse restaurant decor in my time. \\n Update (12-26-19): Starting November 5th, 𝒫 has begun to exhibit an irregularity in its baseline materialization behavior. In irregular cycles, objects will manifest as they have previously for a number of days, followed by an isolated, abnormal day, wherein new objects manifest, such as fill-in-the-blank style storybooks, empty coffee cups, various self-pleasure devices, ribbons and other fabric scraps, metal rulers, Sharpie brand permanent markers, and graphic homoerotic pornography. \\n Addendum 04 - Video Log (01-03-20) \\n Foreword: The following video log is taken from the camera in 𝒫\\'s chamber. \\n 16:19:15\\n𝒫 teleports into the room and looks back and forth rapidly, in a state of panic. A lovely table manifests in the center of the room, surrounded by royal chairs. 𝒫 sits in one of the royal chairs, displaying extreme concern. 𝒫 struggles to exit the royal chair but is unable. \\n 16:22:00\\n𝒫\\'s outfit is instantaneously replaced with an elegant ball gown. 𝒫 attempts to remove the elegant ball gown but is once again unable. \\n 16:23:00\\nThree guests manifest in each of the other royal chairs, along with tea and cookies. 𝒫, displaying a look of horror, picks up a cup of tea and reluctantly takes a sip before returning it to the lovely table. \\n 16:24:00\\n𝒫 has a little party. \\n 16:25:00\\n𝒫 has a little party. \\n 16:30:00\\n𝒫 has a little party. \\n 16:35:00\\n𝒫 has a little party. \\n 16:40:00\\n𝒫 has a little party. \\n 16:44:00\\n𝒫 sets down the cup of tea and grabs on to the nearest royal chair. 𝒫 struggles against the royal chair for a number of minutes before successfully exiting it. \\n 16:47:00\\n𝒫 grabs the royal chair and begins smashing it against the lovely table. After a minute of attacking, the lovely table splits in half, sending all the tea and cookies sliding into a mess on the floor. \\n 16:52:00\\n𝒫 begins screaming at the guests who continue to have a little party, despite the lack of a lovely table or tea and cookies. 𝒫 appears to be in tears. The guests ignore 𝒫 and continue to have a little party. 𝒫 falls to the floor, sobbing. \\n 16:54:00\\n𝒫 stands up. The guests stop having a little party, and stare blankly at 𝒫. The little party demanifests. 𝒫 removes the tattered ball gown, sighs deeply, and demanifests. \\n End Note: 𝒫\\'s whereabouts are currently unknown. \\n « SCP-5557 | 𝒫 | SCP-5559 » \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"𝒫\" by Henzoid, from the SCP Wiki.

As outlined in the Covenant1 between the Foundation and SCP-5690-B, the Foundation will prevent local authorities from disturbing SCP-5690\\'s operation. In exchange, SCP-5690-B will remain inside the city limits and provide transparency into its business practices. \\n Description: SCP-5690 is a brothel located in the city of Las Vegas. SCP-5690 is staffed almost entirely by Ardor-class demonic entities, characterized by a specialty toward the third Cardinal Vice, lust. SCP-5690 currently employs 16 Ardor-class entities. \\n Customers, generally unaware of the anomalous nature of the business, provide payment in exchange for the entities performing sexual acts on them. The entities\\' benefit from this is twofold; in addition to payment to sustain the business, Ardor-class demons are sustained by the Tartarean Resonance Energy produced when they engage in intercourse with a mortal. \\n SCP-5690 was accidentally discovered in March of 1993 by Agent Clark Adams, who was part of the initial wave of personnel transferred to the newly-constructed Site-666. \\n SCP-5690-B is the owner and proprietor of SCP-5690.\\n \\n  \\n INTERVIEWER: Agent Alice Sterling \\n SUBJECT: Agent Clark Adams \\n «BEGIN LOG» \\n STERLING: What the fuck, Clark. \\n ADAMS: No, look, I can explain- \\n STERLING: What were you doing in a brothel? \\n ADAMS: I mean, there\\'s only like two things to do in a brothel. \\n STERLING: And both are illegal! I don\\'t care what you do on your leisure time, but like- \\n ADAMS: Look, can we focus on the anomaly? \\n [STERLING sighs.] \\n STERLING: Yes, alright. Let\\'s hear it, from the start. \\n ADAMS: Well, I\\'d just finished following up on a couple of reports, you know how it is, and I decided to explore the city, get a feel for the place. A couple of the boys, not naming names, had mentioned this one place to me, real fancy, high-class place where you could find a, uh, companion, for the night. So that night I was feeling particularly frisky. You know what they say, the hog wants what it wants. \\n STERLING: Is this really necessary? \\n ADAMS: I\\'m just trying to give you a feel for the story, boss. So anyway, I goes to the place, right, and it\\'s this dinky little hole-in-the-wall building, and that\\'s when I noticed the red lights inside the glass and I think to myself, those motherfuckers sent me to a brothel. They really put one over on me, and I had half a mind to go back and give \\'em a piece of my mind, sending me off to an illegal esta- \\n STERLING: You already told me that you knew it was a brothel, Clark. \\n ADAMS: … Right, yes, I did. \\n STERLING: Just get on with it. \\n ADAMS: Well, I went inside, and then I noticed the little doohickey [ADAMS points to the TRE Counter on the table] started beeping its little head off. I\\'d forgotten to take it out of my bag after my shift, and now it was ruining my evening. \\n STERLING: Then I assume you left the premises and alerted base. \\n ADAMS: Er, no. Well, I-I thought about doing that, but figured it\\'d look real bad if it was a false alarm or something, and I was already there anyway, I might as well investigate some by myself before calling in the cavalry. \\n STERLING: Uh huh. \\n ADAMS: So anyway, the lady at the little desk at the lobby asked me whether I was looking for some fun for the night. I says yes, and she tells me their prices. I paid up, can\\'t put a price on containment- \\n STERLING: With your own money? \\n ADAMS: Of course. \\n STERLING: Then why was there a withdrawal last night of $70 in your name? \\n ADAMS: Uh, gas money? Anyway, I got sent on up the stairs to one of the rooms. I went in, real tasteful place, well-decorated, and flopped out down on the bed. To set up an ambush. \\n STERLING: Naked, according to your report. \\n ADAMS: Yes, boss. When in Rome… \\n [STERLING shakes her head before motioning for him to continue.] \\n ADAMS: Well, a couple minutes later, this woman opens the door and comes through. Nice-looking girl, dressed in some fine evening-wear.

Before release, former SCP-5706 carriers should be treated with Class-B or -C amnestics, depending on the duration of infection. \\n Samples of SCP-5706 are stored in Bio Site-66\\'s cryogenic storage facility; research proposals involving exposure of D-Class personnel to SCP-5706 must be approved by Site-66\\'s Ethics Committee liaison, and all experimental subjects must be treated with the targeted SCP-5706 antiviral at the conclusion of the experiment. \\n Description: SCP-5706 is a strain of the Herpes simplex virus that causes a perceptual anomaly when an infected individual orgasms. The non-anomalous symptoms of SCP-5706 are identical to those of HSV-2, the strain of Herpes simplex which causes most cases of genital herpes; blisters appear on the genitalia within approximately 7 days of initial exposure, and heal over the next several weeks. SCP-5706 is transmitted in the same way as non-anomalous HSV-2, and use of barrier contraceptives such as condoms can reduce its spread. \\n When an SCP-5706-infected individual is brought to orgasm, either alone or with a partner, they experience a perceptual anomaly which includes total sensory hallucination and significant time dilation. This perceptual anomaly consists of the entirety of the action role-playing videogame Skyrim, released by Bethesda Softworks in 2011 (including the three downloadable expansion packs, Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn), beginning at the start of the game, when the player character awakens in a horse-drawn carriage on their way to be executed, and not ending until the defeat of the game\\'s \"final boss\", the dragon Alduin, at the end of the main quest-line. Affected individuals report being placed into the world of the game completely, able to perform actions1 not normally possible in the original game; however, conversations with non-player characters are still limited to the game\\'s original dialogue options, and certain areas, such as any land beyond the bounds of the game\\'s world map, remain inaccessible. Affected individuals are able to access the game\\'s menus, manage their inventory, and save and load their progress by closing their eyes, but all menu options that would quit out of the game are unavailable. \\n Affected individuals report being aware that they will remain in the game world until they complete the main quest-line; Regardless of how much subjective time it takes an individual to complete Skyrim2, to outside observers the perceptual anomaly only lasts for the duration of orgasm3, and its physical signs - closed eyes, open mouth, labored breathing - are nearly indistinguishable from the effects of a particularly strong orgasm. \\n SCP-5706 was first discovered in June 2017, when Foundation agents were alerted to reports of unusual behavior following an orgy held by attendees of the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, California. A number of participants were detained and interviewed; those who had experienced the effects of SCP-5706 all reported sexual contact with a man who resembled Todd Howard, the creative director of Skyrim. At the time of the orgy, Mr. Howard was on stage at Bethesda Softworks\\' E3 presentation. When interviewed, Mr. Howard denied all knowledge of the orgy and of SCP-5706; surveillance of Mr. Howard\\'s banking records revealed that he had recently made several large payments to an account registered under the name \"Simo Plecks\". This account was emptied and closed on the day of the orgy, and all attempts to trace the individual to whom the account belonged have so far been fruitless; the investigation is ongoing. \\n « SCP-5705 | SCP-5706 | SCP-5707 »\"', 'SCP-5950': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-5950 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nSCP-5950 \"Butt Buddies Forever\" by: DrAkimoto \\n   \\n  \\n Traditional artistic depiction of an SCP-5950 instance within a human host. \\n SCP-5950-1 and SCP-5950-2 were held within Livestock Containment Enclosure-9 at Site-21 and provided with the standard maintenance required of domesticated livestock. \\n If new SCP-5950 instances are discovered, they are to be contained in even numbers within Aquatic Transportation Units, according to capacity limits. Instances found already in possession of a host will be contained evenly within Humanoid Transportation Units. All recovered instances will then be transported to Parazoology Site-72 for permanent containment, and the current containment procedures will be updated. \\n SCP-5950 is a parasitic subspecies of Pacific Flying Squid (Todarodes pacificus) capable of fully integrating themselves into human hosts. SCP-5950 instances are approximately 60\\xa0cm in length and weigh 1.5\\xa0kg. Instances have a large human-like eye on the upper tip of their mantle, while the lower mantle terminates in eight legs and two frayed tentacles composed of nervous tissue. Without a host, the average lifespan of an SCP-5950 instance is approximately one year, which is analogous to non-anomalous variants. Members of SCP-5950 use organic jet-propulsion to enter a human host\\'s rectum, similar to the way non-anomalous Pacific Flying Squid use it for aerial locomotion. \\n After entering through a host\\'s anus, the SCP-5950 instance will position itself so its head will remain protruding from the host, functioning as the new visual center. The eight legs fuse to the host\\'s rectum, at which time the SCP-5950 instance will secrete a complex toxin composed of propofol, pentobarbital, thiopental, sodium chloride, and water. This toxin puts the host in a semi-comatose paralytic state during the duration of the infestation. The SCP-5950 instance then attaches its two tentacles to the host\\'s spinal cord and assumes full control of the body. \\n Once fully integrated, SCP-5950 instances will consume food and water using the host\\'s mouth, excreting waste from the same orifice. The SCP-5950\\'s host will walk backward in a quadrupedal position, with their posterior held in an upwards orientation so that their anal eye is facing the direction of motion. While possessing a host, an SCP-5950 instance\\'s average lifespan is approximately 20 years, remaining in the same host for the duration of its life. \\n Two SCP-5950 instances were acquired by the Foundation in 1945, along with several other anomalies formally contained by IJAMEA. The recently discovered species was known to IJAMEA as the \"Shirime Squid\", named after the folklore stories surrounding the species. Due to the strain of IJAMEA\\'s wartime effort, they only documented basic information on SCP-5950. Out of the three captured instances, only two remained alive, with the third dying of unknown causes. The instructions included with the instances indicated that human hosts would be required within six months to keep them alive. \\n Upon containment, D-00789 (M 25) and D-00788 (F 24) were chosen as hosts for the SCP-5950 instances. Once fully integrated into their hosts, the instances were held within Livestock Containment Enclosure-9 at Site-21. \\n In captivity, SCP-5950 display characteristics typically associated with grazing herbivores, consuming approximately two kilograms of vegetation daily. The two instances (designated SCP-5950-1 and SCP-5950-2) acted as a mating pair, though no offspring were ever produced. \\n On 1965/09/22, SCP-5950-2 was found deceased with SCP-5950-1 curled around it in the fetal position. SCP-5950-1 refused to move away from SCP-5950-2, having to be forcibly removed. Its intergluteal cleft was covered in a saline solution. An autopsy revealed SCP-5950-2 experienced sudden cardiac arrest leading to death. \\n Following this incident, SCP-5950-1 displayed behavior typically associated with mourning, including lethargy, consistent tear production, and refusal to eat or drink. After approximately two weeks, SCP-5950-1 died due to dehydration and stress-induced cardiomyopathy. \\n « SCP-5949 | SCP-5950 | SCP-5951 »\"', 'SCP-6090': '\"ADULT CONTENT \\n Do not proceed if you are not over the age of 18 or are not willing to see such content. \\n SCP-6090 \\n SCP-6090 - Therianthropy Virus \\n I hope you enjoyed reading all\\n28.1K words of the narrative!\\nPlease give this SCP an upvote if you did. \\n Read the Author Post in Discuss for: \\n ▸ More by this Author ◂ \\n  \\n   \\n F.A.Q. \\n ChaosMageX\\nClick the Info Bar i above for more info! \\n Once upon a time we ruled over all.\\nOur Queen and her Sister stood so tall.\\nBut then Our Queen\\'s Sister would have the gall,\\nTo embrace the lesser beneath us all.\\nShe loved both Mortals and all of Nature,\\nSo Our Queen twisted their forms to mock her.\\nTurning Nature into weapons for us.\\nMaking it so wondrously dangerous.\\nEven now, we can wield her power still.\\nWe can bend all of Nature to our will.\\nEven these tiny organic machines,\\nSpread Our Queen\\'s curse by their infectious means.\\nTurning men to beasts is only the start.\\nWe won\\'t stop \\'til we\\'ve reclaimed Our Queen\\'s Heart.\\nEven now Mortals still use its power,\\nTo run a Factory so vile and dour.\\nSomeday we\\'ll bring it all crashing down.\\nThen Our Queen will rise and reclaim her crown.\\nKnowing who we are does nothing for you.\\nGet in our way again, and you\\'ll fall too. \\n — The Mabbites \\n Full Moonlight is a cognitohazard for both SCP-6090-A and SCP-6090-B instances. \\n Item #: SCP-6090 \\n Object Class: Keter Flor Galana1 \\n Special Containment Procedures: All infected non-human organisms will henceforth be referred to as SCP-6090-A instances. SCP-6090-A instances are to be kept in standard animal containment units. All contact between SCP-6090-A instances and non-infected animals is strictly prohibited without approval from a researcher with Level 3 or higher clearance. All contact is to be closely monitored at all times; all safeguards are to be taken to prevent bleeding injuries or any other potential methods of bodily fluid contamination. If contamination does occur, the potentially infected individual is to be immediately given medical aid, administered analgesics2, and observed for no less than one hour. \\n All SCP-6090-A instances are to be prevented from exposure to light from a full moon3, outside of experiments authorized by a researcher with Level 3 or higher clearance. Any SCP-6090-A instance that is exposed is to be guarded and closely monitored for any attempts to breach containment. All contact with exposed SCP-6090-A instances is strictly prohibited and any exposed SCP-6090-A instances that breach containment are to be terminated immediately. SCP-6090-A instances that exhibit excessive aggressive behavior outside of exposure are to be euthanized if deemed a threat to Foundation personnel. \\n All infected humans will henceforth be referred to as SCP-6090-B instances. To preserve the Veil of Secrecy, all SCP-6090-B instances are to be relocated to domiciles within anomalous communities under the terms of F.A.C.T.4, unless Foundation containment is deemed necessary and permitted under its exception clauses. All SCP-6090-B instances within the Foundation, contained or employed, are to be provided with appropriate amenities for their unique physiology, in addition to standard humanoid amenities. \\n SCP-6090-B instances contained by the Foundation are to be prevented from exposure to light from a full moon outside of experiments authorized by a researcher with Level 3 or higher clearance. SCP-6090-B instances employed by the Foundation are strongly advised to avoid exposure to full moonlight. Any SCP-6090-B instance that is exposed will be provided with any necessary mood suppressing medications, to be determined on an individual basis, and receive a psychological intervention if appropriate. \\n Description: SCP-6090 is a zoonotic blood-borne virus with universal tropism, known to affect all organisms in the phylum Chordata,5 though its effects are noticeably different in humans. The virus can only spread by direct bodily fluid contamination, and is only viable for up to 24 hours outside of a living host. The infection rate varies widely depending on the method of transmission and the species involved in the transmission. \\n SCP-6090 is incurable in all cases. As of new findings made during and after Incident-6090-1, SCP-6090 can be cured in humans via an injection derived from venom produced by SCP-6090-B instances with infection source species in the genus Crotalus. This venom has been found to contain specialized toxins and oils that specifically target SCP-6090. \\n SCP-6090-A instances display no physiological changes or anomalous behavior, except when exposed to the light of a full moon. Any exposed instance will display increased aggression and anti-social behavior towards all other organisms. It will be compelled to seek out and attack humans in particular, even if it has had no prior human contact. When an SCP-6090-A instance fails to find humans after a varying length of time, or if it is in a situation that would not viably allow access to humans, it will instead proceed to seek out other animals to infect, usually its own species or species it typically preys upon. \\n When an animal is infected with SCP-6090, the virus seems to take on a template of parts of that animal\\'s DNA. When an SCP-6090-A instance infects an animal of a different species, another new variant of the virus is created, with a new template fitting the DNA of the new SCP-6090-A instance. The sole exception to this is humans. When an SCP-6090-A instance infects a human, their variant\\'s template overrides parts of the human\\'s DNA with that of the animal species, transforming them into an SCP-6090-B instance. This transformation occurs extremely rapidly, taking no longer than 11 minutes. The mechanisms behind how SCP-6090 achieves this and why it affects humans differently are not fully understood, though current findings show that it integrates itself with human cells, becoming something akin to a new organelle within them. \\n SCP-6090-B instances are polymorphic entities with the ability to shape-shift, hereby referred to as Therianthropes. They can alter at will their physiology between a humanoid form and a specimen of the animal species that infected them. However, humans that become infected with SCP-6090 cannot return to their original non-anomalous human form. They typically have two forms which they are able to shape-shift between upon getting infected, though other intermediary forms may be obtained with practice: \\n Upon infection, SCP-6090-B instances gain a natural proficiency for operating their Feral Form and shape-shifting into it with minimal conscious effort. SCP-6090-B instances also gain new instincts and behaviors specific to their infection source species, but these are not particularly compulsive or overpowering. In the case of some infection source species, some of these new instincts and behaviors may also manifest in the instance\\'s Base Form, but to a much lesser extent than in its Feral Form. \\n As of new findings made during and after Incident-6090-1, it is theorized that SCP-6090-A instances of anomalous animal species pass on their anomalous traits to all SCP-6090-B instances they infect. This has been demonstrated with an infected instance of SCP-3577. Further experimentation with other anomalous animal species and SCP-6090 is still pending approval. \\n When exposed to the light of a full moon, SCP-6090-B are also compelled to spread SCP-6090 to other humans, though the compulsion is usually subtle and can be resisted easily. Most instances tend to describe it as \"an itch [it] can\\'t scratch,\" though for some resistance is more difficult, requiring mood altering medication and psychological intervention. Investigation is still ongoing into possible correlations between an instance\\'s level of compulsion and its personality and overall mental stability outside of full moonlight exposure. \\n Addendum: New findings obtained during Incident-6090-1 have led to the potential discovery of the origins of SCP-6090. It is now theorized to be an ancient bioweapon created by the Fae to act as a carrier for a Fae Curse. Investigations into this theory are still ongoing, and include the possibility that some inhabitants of the place that may only be described are actually SCP-6090-B instances. It is also possible that the Shakespeare play, A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream, may in fact be the last remnant of a Test Log for SCP-6090 and other Fae-created chemical and biological weapons, with the character Nick Bottom being a test subject for SCP-6090 infection. \\n Section 1: GoI-466 Correspondence: \\n Wilson\\'s Wildlife Solutions Correspondence \\n Sent By: Dr. Randall Davies\\nRecipient(s): Logan Wessler\\nDate: 05/26/2021 \\n Logan, \\n I trust you\\'ve arrived at the Clarita Longhorn Cattle Ranch by now.

Spent the day looking round, asking round, and tracking them down. Yotes have been running round the ranch like they own the place, but things got really crazy last night. \\n We were all out in the twilight, trying to catch glimpses of the super moon eclipse before sunrise. We were also trying to round up some of the yotes while doing that, when one of them broke off from the pack and charged right at us! Scary as hell!

Rabies woulda been bad, but it don\\'t BREAK THE VEIL like the WERE-VIRUS does. One of the ranch hands, Sandy Collins, woke up with a yote head and tail, and I ain\\'t talking godfather style here. Her morning screams woke the whole house up. Had to spend most of the day calming her down. \\n Finally went back and checked our notes after supper, and sure enough there are now copies of them with extra notes about extra yotes. Lucky we also had video of the scene, because of the eclipse. Went back to look at it and yeah, there was a 2nd video file, and it showed 4 crazed yotes coming at us this time. Put them all down, but one got lucky and managed to bite Sandy, and her changes are on that video too. \\n I\\'ve forwarded this whole chain to Bard as well.

I\\'ve already contacted the Supervisors, and the Castaways should be out there around the same time Dr. Dalton arrives with whoever else I can find. \\n We got lucky that whatever vector gave them the Therianthropy Virus likely passed through within the last month. If it had been further back into the two years that have been altered, half the town might have woken up as Therianthropes, especially with the spectacle of a lunar eclipse causing them all to go outside and drop their guard. Wilson himself might have had to take the reins then, and he still might end up having to take them now. \\n You and everyone else out there need to trap all of the coyotes as quickly as possible, and then examine literally every animal you see out there for coyote injuries. Do as much as you can before the cavalry arrives. I DON\\'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES. \\n Deputize the entire ranch if you have to, since they\\'re now inside the Veil of Secrecy anyway. To put it bluntly, we\\'ve just been thrown into a logistical shit storm, and it will only get worse with each Coyote Courtship that\\'s allowed to complete.

Just found another longhorn with a leg bite, by the way. Hope there aren\\'t too many more needles to find in this haystack. \\n End of Correspondence \\n Official correspondence between Mr. Wessler, Dr. Davies, and Dr. Dalton ceased after this final message. From 5/29/2021 onward, Dr. Davies began relaying updates over closed circuit secure channels with Foundation liaisons for GoI-466. The severity of a potential retroactive mass outbreak of SCP-6090 via infected SCP-3577 instances warranted the immediate mobilization of 5 operatives of MTF Beta-4 (\"Castaways\") to lead the efforts, along with 4 additional Foundation General Researchers experienced in anomalous outbreaks. A road convoy of 4 Mobile Lab Trailers, 6 LAAT Trailers9 and 4 Security Support Trailers was arranged and deployed from Site-64, in order to test for SCP-6090 infection on-site, transport all SCP-6090-A instances back to Site-64, and recontain or neutralize them if they should escape en-route. \\n Accompanying the Foundation personnel were 27 volunteers and employees of GoI-466. Amongst them were 11 instances of SCP-6090-B, including Dr. Dalton, who were required to remain in Feral Form while outside any structure controlled by the Foundation or GoI-466. The SCP-6090-B instances covertly assisted in the capture of the remaining SCP-3577 instances and wild animals suspected of being SCP-6090-A instances. The remaining volunteers assisted in testing every animal present on the Clarita Longhorn Cattle Ranch and all neighboring ranches within a 10-kilometer radius for SCP-6090, under the cover story of a potential livestock disease outbreak. \\n After two days of investigation, it was assessed that SCP-6090-B-4342, Sandra Collins, could potentially possess the same anomalous traits as SCP-3577 instances. This is the first documented case of an anomalous animal becoming infected with SCP-6090 and then infecting a human. If confirmed, this would present an unprecedented opportunity to study SCP-3577\\'s abilities from a perspective of sapience, as well as warrant further experimentation with SCP-6090 and anomalous animals. Clearance was obtained for a vanguard portion of the road convoy to transport SCP-6090-B-4342 to Site-64 for further questioning and testing, along with all SCP-6090-A instances captured so far. Two Foundation Researchers and Dr. Dalton accompanied it to perform an initial assessment en-route to Site-64. The reminder of the road convoy, Foundation personnel, and GoI-466 affiliates stayed at the affected area to continue the clean-up efforts. \\n Section 2: Interview Log: \\n Interviewed: Sandra Collins\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-4342, ISS: Canis latrans10 \\n Interviewers:\\nDr. Evelynn Antleur, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3\\nDr. Atticus Rateleken, Foundation Therianthropy Researcher, Level 3\\nDr. Bardolph Dalton, Wilson\\'s Wildlife Solutions Employee\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-863, ISS: Canis lupus11 \\n Foreword: Video log transcript of initial interview and testing, to attempt to determine if SCP-6090-B-4342 possesses similar retroactive reality-bending abilities to those of instances of SCP-3577. \\n Note: Interview is being conducted while en-route back to Site-64, within a Standard Foundation Mobile Lab. Dr. Dalton and Dr. Antleur are seated opposite to SCP-6090-B-4342, with a guard stationed in a corner under standard security protocols. Dr. Rateleken is seated in another corner, as only a partial participant to the interview. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa003:42 PST> \\n Dr. Antleur: State your name for the record please. \\n SCP-6090-B-4342: Sandra Collins, but you can call me Sandy. \\n Dr. Antleur: Thank you. However, I will be addressing you by your SCP-6090-B Instance Identification Number, 4342. \\n (Dr. Dalton softly barks and mutters quietly.) \\n Dr. Dalton: Might as well call me 963 then. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, you really are as cold as they say. \\n Dr. Antleur: (Sighs) And you obviously aren\\'t taking this seriously. \\n 4342: Umm… I really would prefer Sandy. \\n Dr. Dalton: Well, I\\'ll be calling you Sandy for this interview. \\n (Dr. Dalton smiles at 4342. 4342 appears happier and its ears perk up.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: If you really are as good as they say, Dr. Antleur, you\\'ll treat Sandy with some respect. I know this mission hasn\\'t been fun for you, since it seems you hate animals, but at least it\\'s almost over for you. \\n Dr. Antleur: My lack of an affinity for animals is not a topic of this interview. If you are quite done with this pointless banter, I would prefer to return to the actual interview. \\n Dr. Dalton: I know we\\'re all overtired from this non-stop road trip, but let\\'s all try to be nice here. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Fine. Boring conversation anyway. If it\\'s all the same, I\\'ll just hang back for now. I don\\'t have any pressing questions for Ms. Collins at this time, and Bard is taking point on anything Therianthropy related. \\n (Dr. Rateleken exchanges a smile and nod with Dr. Dalton.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Really, I\\'m just trying to kill time until we get back to Site-64, so I can more thoroughly examine the SCP-6090-A instances we\\'ve got with us, especially this little guy. \\n (Dr. Rateleken pats a SAACU12 next to him. An audible rattle starts and speeds up.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: First ever venomous SCP-6090-A instance recovered by the Foundation. Oh, I am excited! \\n (Dr. Antleur rolls her eyes.) \\n Dr. Antleur: Now, 4342, how has your overall mental state been affected since waking up as an SCP-6090-B instance? \\n (4342 growls softly.) \\n 4342: I think I would rather answer questions from Bard for now. \\n Dr. Antleur: Hmph. Very well then. You may proceed, Dr. Dalton. \\n Dr. Dalton: Heh, at least you\\'re giving me the dignity of my name, though I get the feeling that\\'s only because I\\'m on this side of the table. \\n Dr. Dalton: Anyway, onto questions. How\\'ve you been holding up, love? \\n (4342 looks down and reaches up to feel her face. Dr. Dalton frowns.) \\n 4342: It still doesn\\'t feel real. None of this does. I keep thinking any moment I\\'m going to wake up with my old face again, and this\\'ll all have been some bizarre fever dream. But I\\'ve woken up five times now, more if I count my naps, and every time it\\'s still there. It\\'s all still there. I\\'ll never look like myself again. \\n (4342 shuts its eyes. Its ears droop and lips start to quiver. Dr. Dalton gently touches her other hand resting on the table.) \\n Dr. Dalton: No worries. It\\'ll all be alright. I promise, after this, I\\'ll personally introduce you to a Therian Support Group. There are plenty of us out there. \\n (4342 sniffs and moves its hand to wipe its nose, missing it on the first attempt.) \\n 4342: Thanks. Meeting the other Therian volunteers really helped. I\\'m much better off than I was that first night. When exactly will this all be over? \\n Dr. Antleur: That all depends on the results of these tests. They may warrant further tests and continued containment. \\n SCP-6090-B-4342: And how long will that last? \\n Dr. Antleur: Again, it depends on the results of these tests. Further testing may be required on-site. \\n (Dr. Dalton pats 4342\\'s hand a few times.) \\n Dr. Dalton: If there are more tests, I\\'m sure they won\\'t take long. \\n (4342 smiles at Bard. Its ears perk back up.) \\n Dr. Antleur: We need to determine if you possess similar retroactive reality-altering abilities as the anomalous coyote that infected you. If confirmed, we will further test the extent of your abilities. \\n 4342: I still don\\'t understand what any of that means. \\n Dr. Antleur: You don\\'t have to. Simply follow the instructions we give you. \\n 4342: Okay. Whatever will get me out of \"containment\" as soon as possible. Things\\'ll never be the same, but at least you\\'ve shown me I can still live on looking like this. \\n Dr. Dalton: I can guarantee there will always be a place for you in Boring. We can always use more people on team WWS. \\n 4342: Thanks, but I really hope there\\'s one of these \"Anomalous Communities\" you mentioned somewhere in Texas, or at least in the Southwest. \\n Dr. Dalton: I\\'m sure I could find something for you down there too. WWS has set up shop all over the place. Anomalous critters aren\\'t limited to Oregon. \\n Dr. Antleur: (Clears throat.) Once again, could we all please return to the actual topic of this interview? \\n Dr. Dalton: Guess we should get on with it. \\n Dr. Antleur: Now, 4342, are you ready to for this test? \\n 4342: (Sighs.) I really wish you\\'d call me Sandy, but fine, I\\'m ready. \\n Dr. Antleur: I want you to think back to a specific date you went \\'window shopping\\' within the last two years, no earlier than June of 2019, preferably a date in the latter half of 2019. We believe older, vaguer memories may work better for this test, and doing anything in 2020 was rather… complicated, to say the least. \\n 4342: Ugh, tell me about it! I\\'ll be glad when that\\'s all over too. Anyway, yeah, I think I have a date in mind, back in October 2019. \\n Dr. Antleur: Now I want you to think of a particular item that caught your eye on that date, something that you could afford at the time and considered purchasing, but didn\\'t. To ensure success, please try to limit it to something that would fit into that small backpack of yours. \\n (Dr. Antleur gestures to a backpack sitting inside the chamber of a scientific scale on shock absorbers.) \\n 4342: Yeah, there was a pair of binoculars I really wanted. A bit pricey, but I could\\'ve bought them with my credit card. I just wasn\\'t sure how long I\\'d still have my job at the time. Luckily, I managed to get my contract extended. If I\\'d known that back then, I would\\'ve definitely bought them. \\n Dr. Antleur: Good. Finally, did you use a cloud-based digital calendar at that time, one that you still have access to? \\n 4342: I\\'m still using the same account I did back then, so yeah. \\n Dr. Antleur: I need you to access that calendar via your phone and create a new event for that past date, specifying that you\\'ll buy those binoculars. \\n 4342: Heh, guess I can do that, since the app does let you add events to the past, though it all seems rather silly. \\n Dr. Antleur: Despite what you may think, I need you to abandon those notions for the next step. Assign the highest priority you can to the event, add multiple reminders, and compose it in a way that you would have back then, with positive affirmations that you will buy those binoculars and you will be able to settle the debt. \\n 4342: Alright, but reception\\'s kinda spotty and we\\'re in a metal truck trailer rolling down the road. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Just connect to our WiFi. We have a military grade sat link, but you\\'ll have to place your phone flat on the table so we can see its screen. Security protocols and all that. \\n 4342: Okay, what\\'s the password? \\n Dr. Rateleken: [REDACTED] \\n 4342: Heh, seriously? \\n (4342 removes its phone from its pocket and follows instructions.) \\n Dr. Antleur: I need you to do your best to imagine as though you\\'re back in 2019, and you\\'re making this entry prior to its date. \\n 4342: Again, this is silly, and it\\'s still a bit difficult to think back to anything before five days ago. \\n Dr. Antleur: You still need to try. \\n (4342 waves its hand over its face again, trying not to hit its muzzle. Dr. Dalton nods sympathetically.) \\n Dr. Dalton: It\\'s okay there, love. Focus on the past for now, and I\\'ll be here when you snap back to the present. \\n Dr. Antleur: We are simply trying to replicate as closely as possible the only documented instance of a human utilizing the anomalous abilities of SCP-3577, in order to eliminate as many uncontrolled variables as we can. \\n 4342: Yeah, yeah, I got it. Scientific method and all that. \\n Dr. Antleur: Try to get as excited about it as you can. The more enthusiasm the better. Think of it like you\\'re getting yourself an early Christmas present. \\n (4342 takes a deep breath and stares intently into its phone, angling its head so it can\\'t see its reflection. It smiles as it begins to compose the calendar entry. It bounces in its seat a little.) \\n 4342: Aaaand done! Now what? \\n Dr. Antleur: Stay focused on your phone. Don\\'t take your eyes off that event in the app. Keep concentrating on how excited you are to buy those binoculars, and everything you\\'ll do with them once you have them, and how you\\'ll always keep them with you. Don\\'t stop until instructed to do so. \\n 4342: Got it! \\n (83 seconds pass. An alarm goes off. The backpack\\'s weight increases by 0.8\\xa0kg.) \\n 4342: Holy shit, it actually worked?! \\n (The guard points his gun at the backpack. Dr. Antleur puts on a face shield and heavy duty gloves. Dr. Dalton and 4342 look confused, each tilting their head and perking one ear up.) \\n 4342: Ummm, is all this really necessary? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, welcome to the Foundation. That extra weight could be binoculars, or it could be a hostile entity from another dimension. Luckily, I haven\\'t seen it move, so the chances of that are steadily decreasing. Still, don\\'t ever underestimate the possibilities, even if they\\'re under a kilo. A face hugger probably weighs around that much. \\n (4342 laughs, looks around the room and stops. Dr. Rateleken waves a scanner around the outside of the scale, opens the scale chamber and waves it around again. He then scoots over and checks some papers.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Yep, there\\'s now a second copy of my notes! This one has a different weight for the backpack, the one on the scale now, and a pair of binoculars weighing 0.8 kilos has been added to the contents list. \\n (Dr. Antleur pulls the backpack out of the scale chamber by its strap, waves the scanner around it, sets it down in front of the guard and slowly opens it. Each item is checked against both lists. Dr. Antleur holds the binoculars up to her eyes and adjusts them.) \\n Dr. Antleur: It does appear to be a functional, non-anomalous pair of binoculars. Military grade. Rather nice. \\n 4342: You bet they are! Now come on, let me try them! \\n (Dr. Antleur rolls her eyes and hands 4342 the binoculars. 4342 bounces in its seat, grabs them and puts them up to its eyes.) \\n 4342: Freaking sweet! As advertised, though I can\\'t really put them through their paces inside this cramped trailer. \\n (4342 looks around, refocusing the binoculars on every object in the lab trailer. It angles them down and they bump against its muzzle. It freezes and all happiness drains from its face. Its ears droop down and it sets them on the table. It reaches up and rubs its muzzle.) \\n 4342: Oh… right… I guess my mind really was back in 2019 for a moment there. My muzzle\\'s been there long enough that I sometimes forget it\\'s there. \\n Dr. Dalton: I\\'m here for you, love. You can take all the time you need before they perform anymore tests. \\n Dr. Antleur: Keep in mind that we will need to conduct more tests now. We\\'ve confirmed you have similar abilities to SCP-3577. We need to gauge their full extent, and hopefully learn more about SCP-3577 in the process. \\n (4342 stares down at the otherwise ordinary object she managed to somehow pull out of the past.) \\n 4342: As if things weren\\'t already weird enough. Now it turns out I can time travel too. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Again, welcome to the Foundation. We hope you enjoy your stay. \\n 4342: I hope that stay won\\'t be too long. \\n Dr. Antleur: The duration of your containment will depend on the results of further tests. For now, there is one more test we can perform while en-route to Site-64. We will repeat the previous test, but without using a visual aid as a focusing mechanism. Instead, you\\'ll visualize it in your mind. \\n 4342: Okay, I can try. \\n Dr. Antleur: Once again, I need you to think of another date in late 2019 when you went… \\n (Loud radio chatter on the guard\\'s comm. Dr. Antleur glares at him. He gets up and opens an observation slot.) \\n CSR-07: Those trees look way too closely packed to me. Over. \\n 4342: Woah, this trailer has windows?! Sweet, I can field test these after all! \\n (4342 grabs her binoculars and runs over to the window.) \\n Dr. Antleur: Excuse me, but what is the meaning of this interruption? \\n CSR-07: Sorry ma\\'am, the drivers noticed an unusual increase in tree density. Probably nothing but a reforestation project. Just trying to confirm this. \\n 4342: Yeah, you\\'re right. Lot of trees, but no redwoods. Huh, what\\'s that up in the sk… \\n (Video shakes and goes black. Shouting, screaming and vehicle crash noises.) \\n Section 3: Convoy Logs: \\n Convoy Security Retinue Communication and Surveillance Transcript Excerpts \\n Team Lead: CSR-Cap \\n Detachment Manifest: \\n Truck 1: Camouflaged Standard Foundation M.T.F.

Never thought I\\'d see anything like CQ Duty15 again after joining the Foundation. \\n CSR-03: And yet long-haul truckers manage this all the time. \\n CSR-04: Pssh, yeah, with hard drugs. And you\\'re one to talk, since you actually got some sleep. \\n CSR-03: If you can count three hours as \\'sleep.\\' I hate long road trips. \\n CSR-04: At least now we\\'re just a few hours out from the site. Then we can both take some libo.16 \\n CSR-03: Heh, I actually wanted to see some action. These animal missions really are the epitome of the Boring Agreement\\'s name. \\n CSR-04: Yeah, I wish more of those \\'Castaways\\' would learn some damn combat skills so they could handle this shit. \\n CSR-03: Pretty sure the Captain wanted to see some action too, considering he dragged a freaking Gauss Rifle along with us. \\n CSR-04: Still not sure how he pulled that one off for a mission like this, but I bet he\\'s even more bored than we are right now. \\n CSR-03: I\\'m so bored I\\'ve started counting trees! \\n CSR-04: Huh, there are definitely a lot more to count now. I don\\'t remember there being this many in this part of No-Cal. \\n CSR-03: Really? I thought this part of Cali was nothing but trees. \\n CSR-04: Yeah, but not this many, at least not when I was last here. Thought it was just highway hypnosis playing with my head. \\n CSR-03: Eh, probably just a reforestation project. \\n CSR-04: If it is, it\\'s a real shitty one. Trees that close together are a fire hazard. \\n CSR-03: Heh, and so\\'s not raking the leaves between them. \\n CSR-04: I\\'m serious. You hang around with these nature boys long enough, you pick up some things. I think I\\'m gonna call it in. \\n CSR-03: You\\'re gonna piss off the Captain, but it\\'s your funeral, not mine. \\n [Radio Comm Transcript] \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:04 PST (BMNT + 6)> \\n CSR-04: Cap, I\\'m noticing unusually high tree density.

Clock convoy\\'s three and nine. Anything unusual? \\n CSR-06: I only see trees. \\n CSR-07: Those trees look way too closely packed to me. \\n CSR-01: Lot more trees than I remember from a month back. \\n (Faint sound of cracking asphalt.) \\n CSR-Cap: One, please clarify. \\n CSR-01: Was on this road back in April. There were barely any trees then. \\n CSR-Cap: Either this is one fast and sloppy reforestation proj… \\n (VEHICLE CRASH NOISES.) \\n (Recovered video footage shows many root-like protrusions, up to 3 meters in height and 0.5 meters in diameter, sprouting through the road pavement, directly underneath the vehicles. All three trucks are immobile and severely damaged.) \\n CSR-Cap: Status report! \\n CSR-03: Uninjured. Exiting Truck 1 cabin. No sign of hostiles. \\n CSR-04: Still alive and joining Three. Can\\'t see any hostiles either. \\n CSR-02: I\\'m good! But Site Comm\\'s down. We can\\'t call for help. \\n CSR-01: Good here! No hostiles spotted yet. \\n CSR-08: I\\'m okay, but civilian status unknown. Don\\'t see any hostiles near Trailer 3. Lucky. \\n CSR-Cap: Five, Six, Seven, status? Civilian status? Do you read? \\n CSR-08: Gonna check civilian status, but I already got visual on Trailer 2 and it\\'s real bad. Snapped in half like a giant candy bar by those… roots? \\n CSR-Cap: Damn, those are some tough roots. \\n CSR-08: Animals look dead or gone. No visual on Truck 2. \\n CSR-01: I got visual on Truck 2. It\\'s pointed straight up and crushed into Trailer 2. Can\\'t confirm status of Five and Six. \\n CSR-02: Trailer 1\\'s battery case\\'s ruptured. There\\'s a fire! \\n CSR-01: Shit, you\\'re right. It\\'s going up fast. \\n CSR-Cap: Get out what you can outta there! \\n CSR-02: Even the Gauss? \\n CSR-Cap: Especially the Gauss! Busted my ass requisitioning that from the QM.17 \\n CSR-03: Getting the Gauss and its mag now. Not sure how we\\'ll power it. \\n CSR-Cap: Hope we don\\'t need it, and hope Trailer 3 still has power if we do. \\n CSR-08: Confirmed, Trailer 3 has power. I can see its lights. \\n CSR-Cap: Good, hopefully they stay on. And its S.R.A.? \\n CSR-08: Completely FUBAR.18 \\n CSR-02: Dammit! Trailer 1\\'s S.R.A.\\'s also down. \\n CSR-01: Wouldn\\'t matter much. Whole thing\\'s about to be in flames. \\n CSR-04: I\\'m getting the Mini! \\n CSR-Cap: I got what I could! Regroup around Trailer 3. \\n CSR-02: Taking up position now! \\n CSR-04: Going there now. Still no sign of hostiles, but I\\'ll be setting up the Mini. \\n CSR-03: Heading over there too. Hope its battery and aux plug are intact. \\n CSR-01: Should I attempt to climb up and check for Five and Six? \\n CSR-Cap: Do it en-route over to Trailer 3 if you can. \\n CSR-01: Roger that! \\n CSR-08: Got visual on the Civilians. Shit, Dr. A got infected! She\\'s a fucking deer now. \\n CSR-Cap: Fan-fucking-tastic. And the rest? \\n CSR-08: They all look alive. No severe injuries, but Dr. R is trapped. You injured, Doc? \\n Dr. Rateleken: I\\'m stuck, but okay. Got lucky. Couple more centimeters and I might have been gutted. \\n CSR-08: Try not to move then, and for fuck\\'s sake, put your phone down. \\n Dr. Rateleken: But I\\'m taking notes on this incident. \\n (CSR-08 sighs.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Did you guys pack the Jaws of Life? \\n CSR-08: If we did, it\\'s inside a battery fire now. \\n CSR-Cap: Status on Seven? \\n CSR-08: Seven\\'s trapped worse than Dr. A, and he\\'s injured. Seven, you alive? Wake the fuck up! \\n (Slapping.) \\n CSR-07: (Coughs.) Reporting. I\\'m awake. \\n CSR-Cap: Can you access his wounds? \\n CSR-08: Nope, stuck under one of these roots. Might be what\\'s keeping him from bleeding out. \\n CSR-07: I\\'m really stuck. Can\\'t get out, but I can at least move my other arm and point my gun. \\n CSR-Cap: Roger that. Protect the civilians if hostiles start showing. \\n CSR-07: I will until my last breath. (Coughs.) \\n CSR-01: Got visual on Five and Six, and it\\'s a SNAFU.19 Six is definitely dead. Five is unresponsive and underneath a dead steer. \\n CSR-Cap: Is Five alive? \\n CSR-01: Can\\'t get to him to tell you. There\\'s a lot of blood, but I can\\'t tell how much of it is his. \\n CSR-Cap: Understood. Leave them and join the rest of us. \\n CSR-01: Got it, heading over. Weird that the battery fire hasn\\'t spre… SHIT! HOSTILE! SIX O\\'CLOCK! UP IN THE FUCKING AIR! \\n CSR-08: Confirmed! Hostile entity 50+ meters from trailer\\'s six, floating 20+ meters off the ground. \\n (Guns cocking.) \\n CSR-03: Dammit, I still haven\\'t gotten the Gauss set up. \\n CSR-04: The Mini\\'s good to go. Just say the word, Cap. \\n CSR-Cap: ATTENTION UNKNOWN ENTITY! IDENTIFY YOURSELF! \\n (Distant cackling.) \\n [Video footage from Trailer 3 Rear Camera.] \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:08 PST (BMNT + 10)> \\n (Unknown humanoid entity floats forward and downward, its standing pose unchanging.) \\n CSR-02: Shit, I really wish the S.R.A. still worked. \\n Unknown Entity: Good morning, gentlemen. You may call me Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) doffs its sequined bowler hat, holds it to its chest, and takes a bow. His head is clearly musteline.) \\n CSR-08: What the fuck? Is it a were-weasel? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) stands upright and dons its hat. It chuckles and golf claps as it floats closer.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Ah, yes, very astute! I am indeed a Weasel Therianthrope. Sharp eyes you have there. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) touches down on the ground, 10 meters from the trailer. It appears to be dressed in a tuxedo. Its cane appears to be crafted from a tree branch, but with a gun trigger under its handle.) \\n CSR-Cap: Stand down! This is your only warning! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) grins. Its teeth are brightly reflective.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Gentlemen, and ladies, I have journeyed here this fine morning… in order to take your lives. \\n CSR-02: Like hell you will! \\n (CSR-02 fires 3 rounds at Belette Le Fou(ine). The bullets stop mid-air a few centimeters from his torso. Floating green kinetoglyphs20 manifest around them. He slides back on the pavement from their momentum, not even flinching. The kinetoglyphs vanish and the bullets drop to the ground.) \\n CSR-02: What the fuck?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles. It levitates off the ground and starts flying towards CSR-02, doing a twirl. The only sound is its clothes fluttering in the wind.) \\n CSR-Cap: Two and Eight, open fire! \\n (CSR-02, CSR-08 and CSR-Cap open fire on Belette Le Fou(ine). The bullets collide with the kinetoglyphs. Belette Le Fou(ine) is pushed further backwards, but no bullets hit him.) \\n CSR-08: Fuck, that\\'s a strong kinetohazard! \\n CSR-03: Wish Five were here. He knew the most about this bullshit. \\n CSR-Cap: Anyone else know how to counter it? \\n CSR-08: Not familiar with those glyphs. \\n CSR-02: Don\\'t know them either. \\n CSR-04: Negative. All Greek to me. \\n CSR-01: Nope. \\n CSR-Cap: Dammit! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and raises his cane, revealing a gun barrel in its base. It fires 2 shots at CSR-08: the 2nd enters his chest. The bullet doesn\\'t exit his body, but its momentum throws him backwards out of frame.) \\n CSR-Cap: Four, overload the K-H21! Hit him hard! \\n CSR-04: Try to stop this! \\n (CSR-04 starts the Minigun. Belette Le Fou(ine) makes arcane gestures with its other hand as a hail of bullets hit the kinetoglyphs; their green glow intensifies. Not a single bullet reaches its body. It starts to be pushed back. It lands back on the ground and slows to a stop. It starts slowly strolling towards the trailer.) \\n CSR-Cap: Pump it up! Divide and conquer! \\n (CSR-04 maxes out the Minigun firing rate. Belette Le Fou(ine) slows down, but keeps moving forward, leaving piles of bullets on both sides of its path. CSR-01 and CSR-02 come into view on both sides of the frame behind it and fire their M4s at its back. It rapidly alternates looking over its shoulders while pushed back by the barrage of bullets. It cackles and takes to the air, flying out of frame.) \\n CSR-02: Fuck, it\\'s fast! \\n CSR-01: Flying like a fucking trapeze without ropes. \\n (Loud cackling. Bullets hit the ground near the Minigun and shatter the pavement.) \\n CSR-04: Shit! \\n (CSR-04 jumps back as 3 bullets hit the ground around the Minigun, and a 4th goes through its motor compartment. The Minigun flies apart and its spinning barrel bounces away. Various vines and plants begin to sprout and grow out of each impact spot. Vines completely cover the Minigun parts and flowers bloom from them.) \\n CSR-04: Just as well, it was almost out of rounds anyw… \\n (A bullet misses CSR-04\\'s head, but a 2nd enters his skull and backflips his body onto his chest. Brambles grow out of his head wound and every orifice of his face, including his eye sockets. They engulf his body and bloom roses. Belette Le Fou(ine) descends back into frame and lands on the ground. Kinetoglyphs appear in different positions behind it as CSR-01 and CSR-02 try to find a weak spot.) \\n CSR-03: Captain, the Gauss is good to go! \\n CSR-Cap: Fire it now! \\n (Gauss rifle whirrs loudly as it charges. Trailer\\'s internal lights flicker off. Some static from camera switching to internal power.) \\n CSR-03: Eat shit, motherfucker! \\n (Gauss rifle fires and Trailer\\'s lights flicker back on. The largest kinetoglyphs yet appear in front of Belette Le Fou(ine). It\\'s pushed over 100 meters down the road, passing CSR-01 and CSR-02. It tucks its cane under its arm and stops smiling. It wildly gesticulates around the bullet in floating front of it, making blurry distortions in space and shredding it apart. As the giant kinetoglyphs disappear, one lucky M4 round grazes its leg. It yelps in pain and grabs its thigh.) \\n CSR-01: Yes! We finally h… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) smiles wickedly and fires 6 rounds with his other hand. One sends CSR-01 flying through the air and 2 more spin him as he flies. He ragdoll flops down the road and stops in front of the trailer. An entire flower garden grows out of his corpse.) \\n CSR-03: How can it still focus with that wound?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly flies towards the trailer. It aims its cane at CSR-02 as the Gauss Rifle recharges. CSR-02 fires a few rounds at its face, obstructing its vision with its own kinetoglyphs. It fires off 5 rounds at CSR-02 before one hits him.) \\n CSR-Cap: At least we got it on the ropes! Fire again! \\n (Gauss rifle fires. Belette Le Fou(ine) is pushed back 80 meters down the road. It tucks away its cane and starts gesticulating. CSR-Cap fires a few rounds at its legs, but they get caught up in the same Kinetohazard.) \\n CSR-Cap: Shit, looks like we gotta thread that needle. Keep firing at it in succession. Do not let up! \\n CSR-03: The Gauss\\'ll slow down recharging to keep from burning out its capacitors. \\n CSR-Cap: Any way to disable that? \\n CSR-03: Not that I know of. \\n CSR-Cap: Dammit! \\n CSR-03: I\\'ve gotten a feel for it now. I think I can try to max its RoF. \\n CSR-Cap: Good. Keeping firing until you run out of ammo or juice. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and levitates out of frame.) \\n CSR-03: Not this invisible trapeze bullshit again! \\n CSR-Cap: Can you keep a bead on him? \\n CSR-03: I\\'m trying! \\n (Gauss rifle fires. Loud cackling. M4 fires.) \\n CSR-Cap: Almost got the timing down, though it probably won\\'t stay still now. \\n (Gauss rifle fires. Loud giggling. M4 fires.) \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) lands 20 meters from the trailer and raises its cane.) \\n CSR-03: Looks like it can\\'t stay in the air too long. \\n (CSR-Cap swaps out his magazine.) \\n CSR-Cap: I think I got it now. Gonna try a burst shot. Hopefully something hits. \\n CSR-03: Trailer battery\\'s getting low. Make it count. \\n CSR-Cap: You too! \\n (Gauss rifle fires. Belette Le Fou(ine) tucks its cane and gesticulates the kinetohazard in a clean motion as it\\'s pushed to 50 meters away.) \\n CSR-Cap: Yeah, keep on smiling, you son of a bitch. \\n (CSR-Cap takes careful aim and fires a full auto burst right as the giant kinetoglyphs start fading away. Belette Le Fou(ine) swings its cane into its hand and fires three rounds at the same time. One lucky bullet carves out part of its forearm before the rest are blocked by smaller kinetoglyphs. It screams in pain and drops its cane as one of its fired rounds hits CSR-Cap.) \\n CSR-Cap: (Coughs.) hurry… \\n (Gauss rifle fires and Belette Le Fou(ine) flies out of frame to dodge it. CSR-03 grabs her own M4 and fires at the loosed weapon, shattering it. Later examination of its remains indicate that it did not contain any conventional firearm mechanisms.) \\n CSR-03: Just need one more clean shot. I won\\'t let you down Cap. \\n (Metal banging. CSR-03 looks over her shoulder at something out of frame.) \\n CSR-07: Civilians… (Coughs.) evac-ing… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) lands 10 meters from the trailer. It removes an unknown substance from its coat pocket and applies it to its forearm. It visibly winces in pain, but then looks up and grins.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, what\\'s this now? \\n (In the corner of the video frame, a black gray wolf (Canis lupus), a coyote (Canis latrans) wearing a backpack, and a white fallow deer doe (Dama dama) wearing a black sweater flee together into the forest.) \\n CSR-03: I won\\'t let you touch them, bastard! \\n (Gauss rifle fires. Belette Le Fou(ine) stops smiling and rapidly gesticulates with one arm while its other hangs limp. It is pushed over 150 meters away before it leans over to dodge the round instead of neutralizing it. Two tree trunks explode into splinters and fall over along a line 30° to the road.) \\n CSR-03: What the fuck?! Even with just one arm?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) screams and grabs his forearm. Another tree creaks and falls over. Belette Le Fou(ine) kneels down in pain.) \\n CSR-03: Now\\'s my chance! \\n (Trailer\\'s internal lights do not come back on.) \\n CSR-03: Shit, that\\'s it for the Gauss. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) stands back up and releases its grip on its forearm.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It appears that you can\\'t use your fancy toy anymore! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) grins and cackles. CSR-03 grabs her M4.) \\n CSR-03: And it looks like you can\\'t use your right arm anymore! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly levitates towards the trailer.) \\n [Video feed ends from power loss. Audio only.] \\n (Gunfire.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Disabling my arm is just a minor inconvenience. \\n CSR-03: Stand down and surrender! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And why, my dear, should I do that? \\n CSR-03: You\\'re injured, and I can guarantee that Foundation reinforcements are already on their way to investigate our signal loss. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I still have a job to do, and I can guarantee that I\\'ll finish it before that. \\n (Gunfire.) \\n CSR-03: You won\\'t win. We\\'ll bring the hammer down on you for what you\\'ve done. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Knowing you Jailers, those \\'reinforcements\\' will be lackluster at best. \\n (Gunfire. Clicking. CSR-03 laughs nervously.) \\n CSR-03: You won\\'t be able to get to them in time. They\\'re so deep in those woods by now you\\'ll never find them before we find you. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Tch. Tch. Tch. Oh, my dear, you don\\'t understand. They\\'ve already doomed themselves. \\n (Blows landing. Exertion noises.) \\n CSR-03: And why the fuck is that?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s whispers in CSR-03\\'s comm mic.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Whispering:) Because, my dear, those are my woods. \\n (CSR-03 screams. Squelching. CSR-03 gurgles.) \\n Note: Log created from multiple audio recordings and supplemented with notes from Dr. Rateleken. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:04 PST> \\n K.C.Alert:22 Hume at 0.82 \\n Ace: Everyone alive?! Anyone hurt? \\n Trapped between a wall and two… \\n Tree trunks? roots? \\n Wall airbags worked. \\n Nothing broken. \\n Not gutted. Not bleeding. \\n Guard trapped next to me. \\n Bleeding badly. \\n Bard: Oi, that was rough! Not too knackered, but I smashed against the scale and got some cuts. \\n Sandy: I\\'m okay. Lucky I was leaning against the front wall. Did we hit a roadside bomb?! \\n Ace: My theory: These roots slowed and stopped us, then grew through the floor. We all got thrown forward, but you guys slid back. The guard and I slid into the corner, and roots grew around us. \\n Eve: No… no no no no… \\n Ace: Eve, are you hurt? How bad is it? \\n Eve: I collided… with the samples. My leg\\'s bleeding. I feel… feverish. \\n Ace: Shit! Bite down on something! Bard, get the shards out before it starts. \\n Bard: Right! Hold still Eve. \\n Bard tears off sleeve. Tears in half. \\n Eve folds one half. Bites down on it. \\n Eve: (Muffled groaning.) \\n Bard: Got \\'em out! Now brace yourself for the changes. \\n Bard wraps wound with other half. \\n Eve nods. Eyes glassy. \\n Closes eyes. Changes start. \\n Eve: (Muffled screaming.) \\n Sandy: Jesus, is it really that painful? Glad I don\\'t remember changing. Anything I can do to help? \\n Ace: Nothing you can really do for Eve, but you can try to pull me out of here. \\n … \\n Ace: Dammit, wait, stop-stop-stop! I\\'m up against a sharp edge. It\\'s tearing my clothes. Any further and it\\'ll cut me. \\n Sandy: Shit! Sorry. \\n Ace: It\\'s okay… Where\\'s the rattlesnake? \\n Bard: Ace, you\\'re not thinking what I think you\\'re thinking, are you? \\n Ace: Depends on the status of that rare SCP-6090-A instance, and what\\'s going on outside. \\n Bard: Ace, we\\'ve talked about this before. I know what you\\'re thinking. \\n Sandy: Found its carrier, but it\\'s broken. Snake\\'s not moving. Damn, it\\'s bleeding. \\n Ace: Dammit. I figured as much, or it\\'d be rattling like crazy by now. \\n Eve\\'s a white fallow deer therian now. \\n (Eve breathes loudly and raggedly.) \\n Ace: It would be a shame to lose such a unique specimen. Its blood will only be viable for one more day now. \\n Bard: Ace, this is different from dressing up and playing around for a few days. It will be permanent. \\n Eve: Permanent… \\n Eve feels her new doe head. \\n Ace: I know that, but unless the guards packed the Jaws of Life, it might be my only out too. \\n Guard looks through trailer\\'s hole. \\n Two more guards run past outside. \\n One has Minigun. Bad sign? \\n Bard: Speak of the devil. \\n CSR-08: Got visual on the Civilians. Shit, Dr. A\\'s infected! She\\'s a fucking deer now. \\n (Indistinct radio chatter.) \\n CSR-08: They all look alive. No severe injuries, but Dr. R is trapped. You injured, Doc? \\n Ace: I\\'m stuck, but okay. Got lucky. Couple more centimeters and I might have been gutted. \\n CSR-08: Try not to move then, and for fuck\\'s sake, put your phone down. \\n Ace: But I\\'m taking notes on this incident. \\n (CSR-08 sighs.) \\n He doesn\\'t know how important my notes will be. \\n Ace: Did you guys pack the Jaws of Life? \\n CSR-08: If we did, it\\'s inside a battery fire now. \\n Maybe it\\'s finally meant to be. \\n (Indistinct radio chatter.) \\n Guard ducks inside trailer. \\n CSR-08: Seven\\'s trapped worse than Dr. A, and he\\'s injured. Seven, you alive? Wake the fuck up! \\n (Loud slapping.) \\n CSR-07: (Coughs.) Reporting. I\\'m awake. \\n CSR-Cap: (Radio.) Can you access his wounds? \\n CSR-08: Nope, stuck under one of these roots. Might be what\\'s keeping him from bleeding out. \\n CSR-07: I\\'m really stuck. Can\\'t get out, but I can at least move my other arm and point my gun. \\n CSR-Cap: (Radio.) Roger that. Protect the civilians if hostiles start showing. \\n CSR-07: I will until my last breath. (Coughs.) \\n Trapped guard coughs up blood. \\n Sandy: That last breath will probably be sooner than you think. \\n CSR-01: (Radio.) Got visual on Five and Six, and it\\'s a SNAFU. Six is definitely dead. Five is unresponsive and underneath a dead steer. \\n Guard silences radio. \\n CSR-08: Everyone, just sit tight. If there\\'s anything out there, we will protect you from it until reinforcements arrive. \\n Ace: You sure? It sounds like you\\'re already down two men from the crash. \\n CSR-08: We will do everything we can with what we have left, down to the last man. \\n Guard puts finger to ear. \\n Eyes wide. Turns pale. \\n CSR-08: Shit! Just sit tight everyone! Don\\'t leave the trailer! \\n Guard readies gun. Rushes back outside. \\n CSR-08: Confirmed! Hostile entity 50+ meters from trailer\\'s six, floating 20+ meters off the ground. \\n Sandy: Shit, wonder how screwed we are. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.75 \\n CSR-Cap: (Outside.) ATTENTION UNKNOWN ENTITY! IDENTIFY YOURSELF! \\n Unknown Entity: (Outside.) Greetings Gentlemen, you may call me Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Ace: Well, that entity will be Euclid Class if contained. \\n CSR-08: (Outside.) What the fuck? Is it a were-weasel? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Outside.) Ah, yes, very astute! I am indeed a Weasel Therianthrope. Sharp eyes you have there. \\n CSR-Cap: (Outside.) Stand down! This is your only warning! \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.68 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Outside.) Gentlemen, and ladies, I have journeyed here this fine morning… in order to take your lives. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Gunfire.) \\n Sandra: Well… shit. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Gunfire. Loud talking.) \\n Eve: It\\'s more likely to be Keter Class. \\n Ace: Yeah, I concur there. \\n Sandy: The fuck\\'s a kinetohazard? \\n Ace: No time to explain, but that\\'s how it\\'s bulletproof. \\n Sandy: So full auto guns can\\'t stop it?! We\\'re so screwed. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Cackling. Two loud gunshots.) \\n Body lands outside in front of trailer hole. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Minigun firing.) \\n Ace: Definitely Keter Class. \\n Body is Guard that was just talking to us! \\n Gaping chest wound. \\n Something growing from it. \\n Vines? Thorny brambles. \\n Growing out mouth now. Nose. Ears. Eyes. \\n Covering whole body. \\n Sandy: Oh God, what the fuck?! \\n Bard: Seen a lot of nature anomalies, but that\\'s right nasty. \\n Eve: Fascinating. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Minigun firing intensifies.) \\n Ace: Well, the Minigun obviously isn\\'t Neutralizing it. \\n Sandy: (Whines.) So we really are screwed then? \\n Ace: Yeah, getting closer to agreeing with you on that point. \\n (Outside: Cackling. 2 gunshots. Expletive. 4 gunshots. Metal clattering. Minigun firing stops.) \\n Ace: I think I agree with you now, Sandy. \\n Eve: I can\\'t believe I could die here… looking like this. \\n (Outside: 2 gunshots. Body thudding.) \\n Sandy: (Whines.) We really are about to die, aren\\'t we? \\n Bard: (Whimpers.) I really hope not. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Loud whirring.) \\n Lights flickering. Now off. \\n Red emergency lights on. \\n Sandy: What\\'s happening now? \\n Ace: That would be the .80 Cal Gauss Rifle. Uses electricity instead of gunpowder. \\n Sandy: .80 Cal?! That\\'s almost a cannon. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Gauss Rifle fires. Metal sliding. Thud.) \\n Lights back on. \\n Ace: Heh, almost as big as one too. Thought the Guard Captain was a psycho for bringing that on a mission like this, but now… (Chuckles.) Thank Gods he did. \\n Sandy: So we might have a chance?! \\n (Outside: Gunfire. Distant yelp.) \\n Ace: Well, judging by that cry of pain, perhaps we do. \\n (Outside: 6 gunshots. Body rolling and thudding.) \\n Ace: Hmmm… nope, I think we\\'re screwed now. \\n Sandy: (Whimpers.) Oh my God. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Loud whirring.) \\n Sandy: We need to run. \\n Bard: Run to where? (Whines.) If we leave, whatever\\'s out there will see and kill us. \\n (Outside: Gunfire. 5 gunshots.) \\n Sandy: Out into the forest! We\\'re sitting ducks in here, but at least out there we can run and hide. \\n (Outside: Shouting. Gauss rifle fires. Gunfire.) \\n Ace: You three can also blend in as animals. As for me and \\'Seven\\' over here… \\n CSR-07: (Coughs.) It\\'s a shame I can\\'t reach it. \\n Bard: Reach what now? \\n CSR-07: My Lewis & Clark Compass. Anomalous teleportation object. For emergency evac. \\n Sandy: Where is it? Maybe I can reach it. \\n CSR-07: Deep in my back pocket. Left cheek. \\n Sandy: Shit, his butt\\'s completely blocked. \\n CSR-07: (Chuckles. Coughs.) Just as well, I\\'m not sure if it can move more than one person. \\n (Cackling outside.) \\n Ace: Well, maybe I could reach it… if I become a rattlesnake. \\n Bard: Ace… \\n (Loud whirring outside.) \\n Ace: No, I\\'m sure now. Never thought I\\'d decide under duress, but at this point, I either live as a snake-man, or die here. You three need to get into the forest. \\n Sandy: Way ahead of you. \\n Ace: Bard, give me the rattlesnake carcass, and anything sharp. \\n Sandy puts binoculars in backpack. \\n Bard reaches for dead snake and shard that killed it. \\n Sandy: Okay, now, how do I transform again? I\\'ve only done it once so far. \\n (Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Loud cackling. Gunfire.) \\n Just made small incision on my arm. \\n Put dead snake on it. \\n Waiting for reaction. \\n Bard: Imagine yourself as your animal. Imagine running through nature. Think wild thoughts. Whatever gets you there. \\n Sandy: Got it! \\n Bard: Don\\'t forget to handle your clothes first. \\n Sandy: Yeah, yeah, I know. \\n (Loud whirring outside.) \\n Ace: Heh, good thing the lights just turned off. \\n Spasm just went through my whole body. \\n Ace: Bard, it\\'s started. Roll up your shirt so I can bite on it. \\n Bard: Right, here you go. Eve, I\\'m afraid you\\'ll need to get naked and transform too. \\n Eve: I beg your pardon! I am not disrobing in front of all of you. \\n (Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Loud giggling. Gunfire.) \\n Lights not as bright. \\n Trailer battery getting low. \\n Sandy and Bard now in Feral Form. \\n Bard: They\\'ll make transforming difficult, and get ruined in the process. \\n Eve: I\\'d like to keep some modicum of dignity. I\\'ve lost enough already. \\n Sandy slips into backpack. \\n Eve removes boots and lab coat. \\n Bard: The sweater and the rest too, love. \\n Eve: No, this is as far as I go. The rest will either stretch to fit or slip off. \\n (Loud whirring outside.) \\n Eve stuffs dress-shorts into sweater. \\n Bard: If you say so. Now, you— \\n Eve: Yes, I already heard your instructions to Instance 4342. \\n Bard: (Growls.) Now isn\\'t the time to call her th— \\n Sandy: Yes! I can still wear it! \\n Bard: Heh, be careful running though. \\n (Gauss rifle fires outside.) \\n Eve now in Feral Form. \\n Sweater still intact, though stretched. \\n Ace: Bard, I feel the fever, so it won\\'t be long now. I\\'ll go for the compass as soon as I can and flee. \\n Spasms more frequent now. \\n Ace: (Grunts.) Hopefully I won\\'t end up in a part of the Louisiana Purchase or Oregon Territory with bad cell coverage. You three run and hide now. Good luck! \\n (Outside: Loud whirring. Gunfire. 3 gunshots. Screaming.) \\n Bard: Good luck to you too, mate! \\n Sandy: Let\\'s go already! \\n Bard exits through trailer hole. \\n Sandy follows. Eve is halfway through. \\n (Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Gunfire.) \\n Eve: Dammit, come on! I can\\'t be that large. \\n (Hooves slipping and scraping. Metal banging.) \\n **CSR-07: Civilians… (Coughs.) evac-ing… \\n Eve finally squeezes through! \\n Vision blurring. It\\'s starting. \\n Going to stop. Bite. Shirt. \\n (Loud whirring outside.) \\n Ace: (Muffled screaming.) \\n (Outside: Gauss rifle fires. Distant trees falling.) \\n Ace: (Heavy panting.) I\\'m back! I feel different. I can feel my tail now. \\n (Outside: Distant screaming and tree falling.) \\n Ace: I\\'ll take notes out loud since I\\'m alone now. \\n (CSR-07 coughs.) \\n Ace: Mostly alone now. My head\\'s scaly and snake shaped. Wow, my neck\\'s long! \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.74 \\n Ace: The lights are still off, so the trailer\\'s battery is definitely dead, but the hostile entity outside probably isn\\'t. Not good. \\n (Outside: Distant cackling.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.56 \\n (Tail rattling.) \\n Ace: Damn, I can\\'t stop my rattling. Seems to be involuntarily. Possibly stress related? \\n (Rattling is disrupted between loud bumps and bangs.) \\n Ace: I\\'ve got 30 seconds to learn how to use this brand new, noisy appendage. Concentrate… \\n (More bumps and bangs. Rattling gets louder.) \\n Ace: Yes! I slipped it out in front of me without cutting it. Yeah, that\\'s a Rattlesnake rattle alright. \\n (Gunfire outside.) \\n Ace: I\\'m going to strap my phone to my tail as far from the rattle as I can get. Luckily, my phone\\'s case has an adjustable wrist strap and a magnetic stylus. Hopefully I won\\'t lose either while slithering. \\n (Outside: Gunfire. Clicking. Nervous laughter.) \\n Ace: (Whispering.) Now it\\'s time for another crash course: Transforming. Gotta think like a rattlesnake. Imagine slithering in sand. Concentrate… \\n (Outside: Screaming. Gurgling.) \\n Ace: Yes! Achievement Unlocked! Feral Form! \\n (Ace gasps.) \\n Stay quiet! \\n Typing with stylus in mouth now. \\n Tail useless for typing. \\n Felt limbs receding into body. \\n Still can\\'t stop rattling. \\n Only red emergency lights. \\n Also lurid glow outside. \\n Battery fire must be intense by now. \\n Can feel it on my skin scales from here. \\n Now to try to get that compass. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.51 \\n Something in front of trailer hole! \\n Humanoid entity. Standing pose. \\n Floating almost upside down. \\n 135° angle from ground. \\n Clothes defying gravity. As if upright. \\n Now facing me! Smiling. Weasel head. \\n The hostile entity! \\n Ace: (Whispering.) Switching back to audio notes. It\\'s just… floating there… staring at me… menacingly. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Greetings, lad! \\n Ace: (Gasps.) C-care to talk to me upright? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Certainly. \\n Ace: (Whispering.) Rotating around in invisible axis centered on his belt, like he\\'s on a carnival ride. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) grunts in pain.) \\n Ace: (Whispering.) He\\'s wounded though. There\\'s a gash on his right thigh and a large, concave right forearm injury, probably down to the bone. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Allow me to introduce myself. \\n Ace: (Whispering.) He\\'s cordially doffing his disco ball bowler hat and bowing. His clothes are torn around the wounds. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I am Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Ace: (Whispering.) There\\'s something over them. Living seaweed? It\\'s throbbing with his heartbeat. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): My, my, what a diligent researcher you are. Still taking notes, even in the face of death. \\n Ace: Well, hopefully my notes will survive, even if I don\\'t. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I wouldn\\'t count on that. \\n Ace: At least you\\'re upright now. \\n (Gunfire.) \\n Ace: So you are using kinetohazards then. \\n (Bullets clinking as they hit the ground.) \\n CSR-07: (Coughs.) You\\'ll have to kill me first. \\n Ace: You\\'re badly wounded. Wouldn\\'t it behoove you to retreat before reinforcements arrive? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Merely flesh wounds. Not enough to stop me. \\n CSR-07: Come a little closer (Coughs.) and I\\'ll give you some more \\'flesh wounds.\\' \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, how amusing. Feel free to try. As for those \\'reinforcements,\\' I don\\'t really care. Your friend already warned me about them, mere moments ago, before I killed her. Though I have to admit, I wasn\\'t expecting that fancy toy she used. \\n (Gunfire.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) This, on the other hand, was thoroughly expected, easily countered, and greatly enjoyed. \\n (Clinking.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Go on, empty your entire magazine. It won\\'t do you any good, unless you decide put one in your head before I decide you no longer amuse me. It would likely be a more pleasant death for you. \\n Ace: What\\'s your end goal here? Get your rocks off slaughtering a low security Foundation convoy? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Chuckles.) Oh, I\\'m so glad you asked. The answer isn\\'t nearly as crude, though I do thoroughly enjoy killing you Jailers. It\\'s been so very long since I\\'ve had the opportunity, and great pleasure, to do this. \\n Ace: Are you going to tell me, or just keep playing coy? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Very well. My associates and I wish to compare notes with you Jailers. See what you\\'ve discovered, assess its worth, and then destroy all of you findings, so that only we possess the data. And have a little fun along the way, naturally. \\n Ace: Who are your associates, and what \\'notes\\' did you plan on \\'comparing\\' with us? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Nuh, uh, uh. I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to have to keep playing coy there, though you can probably guess the latter answer. \\n Ace: And when you\\'re done \\'comparing notes\\' with me? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Must I repeat myself? Destroy your copy of the data, of course, including yourself. \\n (Gunfire. Clicking.) \\n CSR-07: Ru- Slither away! (Coughs.) NOW! (Coughs raggedly.) \\n (Rattling fades away.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I admit, that is rather clever. Aiming for my head to block my vision with my own kinetic runes. \\n (Clinking.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): One of your friends did the same, but it didn\\'t do her any good, and it hasn\\'t done you any good either. \\n CSR-07: (Coughs.) It let him get away, didn\\'t it? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Yet another minor inconvenience. He\\'ll be easy enough to track from just his rattle alone, let alone the fact that he\\'s slithering right into my forest. Oh, what fun this will be! \\n (CSR-07 coughs between words.) \\n CSR-07: You won\\'t win. Kill everyone on this mission, and the Foundation will send more. We will find you, and we will contain you… or neutralize you. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Hmmm, now that you\\'re out of ammunition, you no longer amuse me. It\\'s a shame you didn\\'t save a single bullet for yourself. \\n (CSR-07 coughing. Squelching.

Try to remain calm. \\n Calm will keep it silent. \\n (3 minute pause.) \\n Hume levels haven\\'t risen anymore. \\n Forest might be anomalous. \\n (2 minute pause.) \\n Being a snake is interesting. \\n I can taste air now. \\n Like smelling, but different. \\n I wasn\\'t feeling heat on my scales. \\n It was from my heat sensing pits! \\n Sixth sense, both figuratively and literally. \\n Luckily, not some Predator Vision synesthesia. \\n No heat blobs in my vision. \\n That would be annoying. \\n No idea how to describe it. \\n … \\n Like how you can feel when someone is hiding in a room with you. \\n Though, in my case, I could quickly find their hiding spot. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.75 \\n (Rattling.) \\n Entity might be nearby? \\n Going Ouroboros again. \\n (Muted rattling.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.65 \\n (Muted rattling intensifies.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.54 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Hello again, lad. \\n (Loud rattling.) \\n Entity is right outside hole! \\n Looking at me. Smaller? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): As diligent as ever, I see. \\n (Whooshing. Bumping.) \\n Ace: S-so, you\\'re just going to invite yourself inside then? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Of course! This is my tree, after all. \\n Ace: You\\'ve shrunken your hat and upper tux to fit your Feral Form. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Naturally. I always maintain my dignity, no matter what form I take. \\n Ace: Between your lack of pants and your weirdly twisted ferret torso, you look more cartoonish than dignified. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) I suppose that\\'s true. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) winces in pain.) \\n Ace: Your forearm really does look bad. At least your bandages shrunk too. \\n (Whooshing.) \\n Ace: Hey, stop looking over my shoul.. where my shoulder would be! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Tch. Tch. Tch. I would appreciate if you used my actual Name in your notes about me: Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Ace: Why do I keep typing it like that? It\\'s like I can\\'t fight the urge to add those parentheses. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Mmmm, it\\'s because my Name is a Nomenclative Paradox. \\n Ace: Nomenclative… Paradox? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I can see that Nomenclative Hazards aren\\'t your forte. Then again, few Jailers are familiar with my people. \\n Ace: Your… people? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Why, the people of that wretched prison of trees, of course. \\n Ace: I… don\\'t follow. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) You really are simple, aren\\'t you? It\\'s better that you don\\'t. It makes things more fun. \\n Ace: Uh… \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Well, to put it simply, my Name is both two names and no name at the same time. \\n Ace: … Okay. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I can see that you\\'re confused, so let\\'s move on. \\n Ace: Yes, let\\'s do that. So, you wanted to compare notes with us. I\\'m guessing either about SCP-3577 or SCP-6090, right? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Ha! Maybe you aren\\'t as simple as I thought. (Winces.) Yes, Trickster Magic is interesting, but not nearly as interesting as Therianthropy. \\n Ace: So you want to review our findings on SCP-6090? I\\'m afraid to say we really only know the basics, just like the rest of the world behind the Veil. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Are you sure you didn\\'t learn anything more? I find it hard to believe you Jailers would even take an interest in a mission like this otherwise. \\n Ace: Honestly, we were more concerned about a possible SCP-3577 outbreak, and any possible connections to a rather unfortunate incident. We\\'re still cleaning up its aftermath. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And you Jailers honestly weren\\'t worried the Therianthropy Virus would exacerbate either of those dilemmas? \\n Ace: Of course we were! That\\'s why we were transporting every SCP-6090-A instance we could find back up to Boring. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Winces.) Yes, along with that were-coyote girl. A rather coincidental source species, wouldn\\'t you agree? \\n Ace: We intended to save the U.I.U. some trouble and relocate her to Three Portlands under the conditions of the F.A.C.T. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Of course you were. I\\'ll bet you Jailers hate that you have to set Therianthropes free. \\n Ace: So it\\'s her you\\'re after then? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, don\\'t sell yourself short! You\\'re also quite the interesting Therianthrope. All of you are! \\n Ace: Is that why you\\'re really doing this? To experiment on all of us? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Why not? (Winces.) After all, you\\'ve all entered my personal petri dish. \\n Ace: So you\\'re part of this anomalous forest then? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Maybe. Would it even matter? You\\'re at my mercy either way. \\n Ace: I don\\'t know what you stand to gain, and it looks like your injuries are getting worse. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Again, a minor inconvenience. Any iron in my system will be purged eventually. \\n Ace: Iron? As in the bullet shrapnel? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You really aren\\'t familiar with my people, are you? Oh, this is delightful! (Winces.) \\n Ace: Since you\\'re going to keep playing coy about \\'your people,\\' why don\\'t you tell me what you know about SCP-6090? After all, \\'comparing notes\\' goes both ways. Would you happen to know of its origins or a cure? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Not even my people know of a cure, but we do have our own theories. It is rather amusing you should ask of its origins, though. \\n Ace: I take it \\'your people\\' know more about its origins than we do? Did \\'your people\\' create it? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh ho ho! Perhaps I really was wrong in calling you a simpleton. \\n Ace: I\\'ll take that as a yes. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Viruses are such fascinating little organic machines. You humans have only been toying with them for 130 years. My people have been doing it for much, much longer, all the way back to our Queen. \\n Ace: Your Queen? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I fear I may have already said too much. I do tend to get carried away with these scintillating conversations. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) winces loudly.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine) stretches his left paw to grab his right arm. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine) curls into ball in pain. Stops smiling for 3 seconds. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Ah, back to taking notes, I see. Just as well, I\\'m finished giving answers. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine) twists torso like ferret again. Floats out hole. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I\\'d suggest leaving this tree before dawn, unless you actually want to be bitten in half. (Winces.) \\n KCAlert: Hume to 0.63 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I\\'ll be back to check on you later. Perhaps we can have another chat, and maybe conduct an experiment or two. (Cackles.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.71 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine) flies through the trees and out of sight. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.84 \\n Note: Log created from Audio Recording made by Dr. Evelynn Antleur. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:22 PST> \\n (Rustling. Running sounds.) \\n SCP-6090-B-4342: So how long do we keep running? \\n Dr. Dalton: As long as we can, as fast as can. We need to get as far from both that fire and that thing as we can. \\n SCP-6090-B-4342: What\\'s weird is the battery fire didn\\'t look like it was spreading, and it was freaking intense. \\n (Sounds of running fade.) \\n Dr. Dalton: (Distantly.) Hey Eve! Why\\'d you stop?! \\n Dr. Antleur: We\\'re running in circles! \\n (Footsteps approaching.) \\n Dr. Antleur: And please address me as Dr. Antleur. \\n Dr. Dalton: Eve, now\\'s not the time. It\\'d be better if you just call me Bard and her Sandy. \\n Evelynn: (Sighs.) Very well. I suppose this situation does call for shorthand. \\n Bardolph: Now, what do mean? I\\'ve been following the stars to run straight. \\n Evelynn: This boulder is rather distinct. I\\'ve noticed it thrice now. That can\\'t be a coincidence. \\n Bardolph: A rock\\'s a rock. We need to keep moving. \\n Evelynn: I believe we might be in an anomalous forest. \\n Sandra: I\\'m actually with Eve on this one. If we run to exhaustion, and that thing still finds us, what then? \\n Bardolph: That thing will catch up to us if we stop. \\n (Fabric rustling.) \\n Sandra: Woah, you had your phone in your sweater pocket? \\n Evelynn: Of course! … How am I even able to hold it? \\n Bardolph: Your foreleg shape-shifted. That\\'ll happen automatically, whenever you do human stuff in Feral Form. \\n Sandra: Cool! \\n Evelynn: Fascinating. I did reach for it before I remembered that I\\'m… this now. \\n (Tapping.) \\n Evelynn: It seems my other foreleg shifted to use my phone. My hooves and dew claws have formed into a hand-like appendage. \\n Bardolph: Please, Eve, can we get going? \\n (Tapping.) \\n Evelynn: Just as I suspected, the ambient Hume level is below baseline, so this forest is indeed anomalous. \\n Sandra: In English? \\n Evelynn: This forest is \\'weirder\\' than it should be. \\n Sandra: And your phone can measure the weirdness level? \\n Evelynn: Yes. \\n (Fabric rustling.) \\n Bardolph: Okay, now can we get going? \\n (Loud thudding.) \\n Bardolph: What are you doing bucking that tree?! \\n Evelynn: I\\'m making a distinct mark for an experiment. \\n Bardolph: Yeah, but isn\\'t that overkill?! \\n Sandra: Heh, you trying to harvest invisible apples? \\n (Thudding stops.) \\n Evelynn: I\\'m simply channeling my energy into something productive, as a coping mechanism. \\n Sandra: (Whimpers.) Oh… yeah… \\n Bardolph: Eve, I\\'m right sorry this happened to you, but it\\'d be better if you channeled that energy into running instead. \\n Evelynn: 43… Sandra, I need to you to use your binoculars as an optical rangefinder, to gauge the distance between marks I make. We\\'ll soon know if this forest is repeating itself. \\n Sandra: Heh, I\\'ll take Sandra. Still better than a number. \\n Bardolph: And what do I do? \\n Evelynn: Stand guard. \\n Sandra: Wow, you\\'re right Bard. My paws changed without me thinking. My dew claws are like thumbs now. \\n Bardolph: It\\'s weird at first, but you\\'ll get used to it. \\n Sandra: And I really do have better night vision. How long will we do this? \\n Evelynn: Until my theory is verified, or until we lose the lodestars24. \\n Bardolph: You do realize we won\\'t be able to navigate again for hours? For the record, that\\'s when I was planning a rest stop. \\n Evelynn: If my theory is correct, our ability to navigate won\\'t matter. \\n [IRRELEVANT DATA EXPUNGED. NO CONVERSATION.] \\n <Continue Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:36 PST> \\n Bardolph: Stars are almost gone. Hope you\\'re proud of slowing us down and leaving a trail. \\n Sandra: There\\'s no way. (Whines.) \\n Bardolph: Well I\\'ll be damned. \\n Evelynn: We may all be literally damned now. Unfortunately, my theory is correct. \\n (Loud thudding.) \\n Bardolph: Eve, I know it\\'s upsetting, but please stop. \\n Sandra: That\\'s the first mark! We really are running in circles! \\n (Thudding intensifies.) \\n Bardolph: Seriously, Eve! There\\'s no point in the marks anymore! \\n (Thudding stops.) \\n Evelynn: Apologies. I just needed a moment. Sandra, what range do you have? \\n (Sandra whines.) \\n Evelynn: Sandra Collins! Instance 4342! \\n Sandra: Roughly 150 meters. \\n Evelynn: Summed up, that marks approximately 1650 meters before repetition occurs. \\n Bardolph: So, what exactly does that mean? \\n Evelynn: It means that the forest is indeed Non-Euclidean. I doubt we\\'ll be able to access the road we came from. This forest is also very likely connected to the entity that ambushed our convoy. \\n Sandra: So… we\\'re trapped? At the mercy of that… thing? That thing even a fucking Gauss Rifle couldn\\'t put down?! \\n Evelynn: That is a possibility, and this wouldn\\'t be the first documented case of malicious entities trapping people. \\n (Sandra whines loudly.) \\n Bardolph: (Whimpers.) So, what now? Maybe it only repeats in that direction. \\n Evelynn: That\\'s also a possibility. We should probably repeat the experiment at a 90° angle, once we\\'ve regained the ability to navigate. For now, we need to find a secluded area to rest and plan. \\n Sandra: How… long… ? \\n Evelynn: Impossible to say. There are cases of entities trapping victims for what they perceived to be millions of years. \\n (Sandra howls.) \\n Evelynn: Sandra, you need to learn to stifle yourself! \\n (Sandra whines and sobs.) \\n Bardolph: Eve, you need to learn to read the room! \\n Evelynn: I am merely making statements based on our observations and similar cases. She asked questions, and I answered them. \\n Bardolph: Yeah, but you don\\'t lead with the worst case! \\n Evelynn: Would you rather I withheld vital information? \\n Bardolph: I\\'d rather you stay quiet for now. \\n Sandra: It\\'s not fair! \\n Evelynn: Sandra, stifle your… \\n (Bardolph growls.) \\n Bardolph: There now, love, we\\'ll get through this together. \\n Sandra: But that thing said it wants to kill us! \\n Bardolph: It might have just meant the Guards. \\n Sandra: So what, then? Does it want to torture us? \\n Bardolph: I couldn\\'t tell you, but what I can tell you is that you\\'ve got us to face it with you. I\\'ll do everything I can to make sure it doesn\\'t hurt you. \\n Sandra: I didn\\'t ask for any this. \\n Bardolph: None of us did, love. \\n Sandra: No, not just this bullshit. This new face. These freaky new powers. I just want to go home, back to my old life, friends and family, but I know even that\\'s not an option now. \\n Bardolph: I told you, there are plenty of options out there for you, and you\\'re always welcome in Boring. \\n Sandra: Yeah, and what about everything I\\'m leaving behind? (Whimpers.) When the pandemic happened, I just kept telling myself to wait it out. That eventually, I\\'d get to hang out with my friends again. That the places where we used to hang out would be fully open again. And no more mask bullshit! But now… Now that will never happen, and I\\'m stuck wearing a different kind of mask, one that I can never remove to see my old face again! \\n Bardolph: You still have pictures of yourself prior to infection, don\\'t you? Surely you took some selfies, right? \\n Sandra: It\\'s not the same! Just another cruel reminder of what I can never have again! \\n Evelynn: This is a waste of time and will likely draw attention to us! \\n Sandra: You really are an ice cold bitch, you know that. \\n Evelynn: I\\'m being practical, and technically, since you are a female canine, you are the actual bitch here. \\n Bardolph: Okay, both of you are getting way out of line! \\n Evelynn: No, she\\'s the only one out of line by not focusing on our current situation. We need to escape this forest, and then cope with what we\\'ve become. \\n Sandra: Yeah… cope… That\\'s easy for you to say. You were already living and working in weird world before this happened to you. You get to keep your job and your friends and everything else that matters to you. They\\'ll all just shrug off your new look. \\n Evelynn: Hmph. For your information, I may work behind the Veil, but I still had a life outside it. There are also venues I was looking forward to visiting again and people I wanted to see again. I will have to cut ties with all of that now. \\n Sandra: Well, at least you still have your career. I\\'m not sure what career I\\'ll be able to make for myself now, if any. As if that wasn\\'t already hard enough to do \\'outside the Veil,\\' before all this happened. \\n Evelynn: True, but now it will likely become much more difficult to advance my career. I may never become a Site Director now. \\n Sandra: I\\'m so sorry you won\\'t get to climb that corporate ladder. Must be nice. \\n Evelynn: And despite what you might think, not everyone I know will simply \\'shrug off\\' my condition. Even my coworkers and supervisors. They\\'ll never see me the same way again, both figuratively and literally. (Voice breaking.) I doubt he\\'ll ever love me looking like this. I doubt anyone ever well. \\n Sandra: Huh, I hadn\\'t even considered romance. Of course, that was always the last thing on my mind, even before all of this. My ex can go fuck himself with a kitchen knife. At least he\\'ll also never get to see my old face again, and this makes ghosting him so much easier. One of the few good things to come out of it. \\n Bardolph: Hey now, I\\'m sure you\\'ll find love again. Both of you will! \\n Sandra: Oh, please! There\\'s only one group of people that would find us attractive now. \\n Evelynn: Please refrain from bringing up those people. I\\'d rather not think about those prospects yet. \\n Bardolph: Hey! Not all of us… them are bad! Some would just be happier as animals. I\\'m certainly happier in my Feral Form than in my Base Form. \\n Sandra: (Gasps.) Oh my God, you\\'re one of them, aren\\'t you?! \\n (Sandra laughs.) \\n Sandra: I\\'d know that bashful expression on any dog. You really are! This is hilarious! I\\'ll bet you find me attractive, don\\'t you? \\n Bardolph: Well… I… uhhh… \\n Sandra: (Giggles.) You know Wolves and Coyotes are capable of interbreeding, don\\'t you, you dirty dog? \\n Bardolph: Well… yes… of course… \\n Evelynn: (Clears throat.) Could you please cease these vulgarities?! Romance is also the last thing I want to think about, especially right now. \\n Sandra: (Sighs.) Yeah, sorry. I just really needed a moment to take my mind off the fact that we\\'re trapped in a magical forest of death. \\n Bardolph: Heh, I\\'m just glad you\\'re feeling better, love, even if it\\'s at my expense. \\n Evelynn: Then I\\'d suggest we first concentrate on escaping this place alive. Afterwards, we can focus on cutting all ties beyond the Veil. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Mmmm, yes, \\'cutting all ties.\\' \\n (Sandra yips.) \\n Bardolph: (Whimpers.) Oh… No! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It\\'s astounding how willing you Jailers are to destroy even your own lives, on top of the countless lives of many others, for the sake of preserving \\'normalcy.\\' \\n Sandra: Holy shit, he really is a were-weasel, in a freaking tux! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I would have thought the previous year alone has taught all of you Jailers how drastically \\'normalcy\\' can be shifted, even by the most seemingly insignificant things, so it doesn\\'t really matter in the end. \\n Evelynn: How long have you been up there? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Long enough to overhear most of this amusing argument amongst Jailers. \\n Sandra: Why are you calling us Jailers? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, my apologies for the confusion. I am addressing them, my dear, not you. Terribly sorry. \\n Sandra: Okay, why do you keep calling them Jailers? \\n (Air whooshing. Sandra yelps. Gravel crunching.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Because that\\'s what they are, my dear. \\n Bardolph: Hey, get away from her! (Growls.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Sure, the wolf there may not work for them, but he aids them enough that he might as well be one. \\n Bardolph: I said get away from her! (Barks.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): But you, my dear, you aren\\'t like them. You\\'re something special, very special. \\n (Bardolph growls louder.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, I can tell! I have an eye for such things, and unfortunately, so do they. Let me guess, they plan on taking you back to their \\'site\\' to run some more \\'tests\\'? \\n Sandra: Y-yes, but they said once those were complete, I\\'d be free to go. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Cackles.) Yes, I\\'m sure that\\'s what they told you, but I\\'m also sure those \\'tests\\' will beget more \\'tests,\\' which will then beget more in turn, ad infinitum. \\n Sandra: Ad infinitum? \\n (Air whooshing.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): As for me, I simply wish to compare notes with all of you, and have a little fun along the way. \\n Evelynn: And after you\\'ve \\'compared notes\\' with us? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Then this will all be over, and so will your lives. I prefer not to drag things out with false hope like you Jailers do. \\n (Sandra growls.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Tch. Tch. Tch. It seems you\\'ve made quite a mess of things, though. \\n Evelynn: We\\'ve determined that we\\'re trapped in an area roughly 1.5 kilometers in length. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) I could have told you that without all the effort, but it does explain some sensations. \\n Evelynn: So you are indeed the one who trapped us then, via a connection with this anomalous forest. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Cackles.) Very astute, my dear! Now, let\\'s undo what you\\'ve done. We can\\'t have anymore cartography, now can we? \\n (Wood groaning and creaking.) \\n Evelynn: You can heal the trees? Just how much control do you have over this place? \\n (Rocks clattering.) \\n Sandra: Fuck you! You ain\\'t torturing or killing me without a fight! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Ow! \\n (Wood creaking stops.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Stop! \\n Sandra: What the fuck?! \\n Evelynn: Kinetoglyphs. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): How uncouth! It\\'s very rude to throw things, my dear. \\n (Rocks falling to ground.) \\n Evelynn: Ah, so Dr. Rateleken was correct. You can create defensive kinetohazards. \\n (Air whooshing. Fabric fluttering. Grass crunching.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Closely.) Oh ho ho! Very astute indeed, my dear. Maybe you aren\\'t as simple as he is. \\n Bardolph: (Growls.) What did you do to Ace?! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Mmmm, wouldn\\'t you like to know? \\n Evelynn: It used the present tense, so it likely hasn\\'t killed him. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Wow! You may be too smart for your own good. I might just kill you right now. \\n Bardolph: (Growls. Barks.) You better no… \\n Evelynn: But then we wouldn\\'t be able to \\'compare notes\\' first. Isn\\'t that what you want? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Cackles.) Right you are, my dear! Still, I will kill you if you don\\'t start using my name. \\n (Rocks clattering.) \\n Sandra: Hey! Cut her some slack! She isn\\'t really good with name courtesy. \\n (Rocks falling to ground, one by one.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Please stop throwing those rocks. Don\\'t make me repeat myself. \\n (Rocks pouring onto ground.) \\n Evelynn: Nonsense, Sandra. Very well, Belette Le Fou(ine), what notes do you wish to compare? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Oh, I was hoping you\\'d finally ask that! Why, the very reason you\\'ve changed, of course. \\n Evelynn: Hmmm, so our findings on SCP-6090, the Therianthropy Virus, then? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Yes! So tell me, what do you know about it? \\n Evelynn: Unfortunately, little more than what the rest of the world within the Veil knows about it. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And doesn\\'t that bother you? Not only as a Jailer, but as someone who\\'s now cursed with it as well? \\n Evelynn: I would hardly call this infection a curse… \\n Sandra: I sure would! \\n Evelynn: …though it is interesting you\\'d use that phrasing. Do you consider it a curse? Given your physiology, I\\'m assuming you\\'re infected as well. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Cackles.) So smart, and yet still so ignorant! You Jailers really are still in the dark as to its machinations, but isn\\'t the dark where you all insist on dying, after all? \\n Evelynn: True, we still don\\'t fully understand the mechanisms behind its effects, particularly in humans and the polymorphic abilities it gives to them. However, our latest findings indicate that there may very well be a powerful thaumaturgical or even reality bending element to it. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) And I\\'m guessing she\\'s your \\'latest findings,\\' isn\\'t she? \\n Evelynn: She is our most recent documented case of infection in humans, yes. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I\\'ll bet she\\'s much more than that, isn\\'t she? \\n Sandra: Yeah, I think I can change the past now, like that magical coyote that changed the past to bite me. \\n Evelynn: Sandra! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, what\\'s with that motion, my dear? Has she said too much now, or did you simply want me to lop off your head? \\n (Evelynn clears her throat.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Yes, I\\'ll bet you hate having a deer head now, don\\'t you? Would no head at all suit you better? \\n Bardolph: (Growls.) If you so much as try… \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Cackles.) You\\'ll do what? I\\'m genuinely curious what you\\'d do if I were to kill her right in front of you, since you seem to be the least equipped of everyone here. Shall we find out? \\n (Bardolph barks and growls. Sandra growls.) \\n Evelynn: I-I\\'ll settle for having a d-deer head. Now… w-what more did you want to discuss? I… I can go over more details of SCP-6090 with you. \\n (Rocks clattering.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): What did I just warn you against earlier, my dear? \\n (Rocks fall to ground. Evelynn starts hyperventilating.) \\n Sandra: I don\\'t care! You aren\\'t killing her, or me, or Bard! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Futile, but still amusing. It\\'s also amusing you\\'ve discarded decency and assumed your humanoid form to defend her. \\n Sandra: What the fuck are you…? Oh, God! When did I…?! \\n (Sandra screams. Rocks pouring onto ground. Rapid footsteps and rustling.) \\n Sandra: Stop oggling me, you perverted furries! \\n (Air whooshing. Fabric rustling. Evelynn takes deep, ragged breaths.) \\n Bardolph: I wasn\\'t even looking at you! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and guffaws. Its frequency changes from Doppler Effect. Later notes from Dr. Antleur indicate that Belette Le Fou(ine) was flying around wildly and flipping in a manner similar to a trapeze artist while laughing.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You humans really are so wildly amusing! I can see why my people tried a similar experiment on a fateful summer night, so long ago. \\n (Evelynn\\'s breathing slows and calms.) \\n Evelynn: A similar experiment? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oops! Once again, I may have said a bit too much. (Winces.) Perhaps I\\'ll go check on your friend now. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles, which fades away. Evelynn loudly exhales and takes slow, shuddering breaths.) \\n Bardolph: Thank God that\\'s over! \\n Sandra: It\\'s only over for now. Why didn\\'t you fuckers tell me I changed?! I didn\\'t even notice! \\n Bardolph: I swear to God, I didn\\'t notice either! I was too focused on whether Belette Le Fou(ine) was about to kill Eve! \\n Sandra: What the fuck happened?! I thought only my paws would change to throw those rocks! \\n Bardolph: When you try to do something too human, like those cricket pitches you were doing, you can change back involuntarily. Happens quite often with new Therians. \\n Sandra: So you really were looking at me, you pervert?! \\n Bardolph: No, I\\'m only guessing, I swear! \\n Sandra: Yeah, right! Just don\\'t look at me now. \\n Bardolph: Okay! I\\'ll… I\\'ll go check on Eve. \\n (Approaching footsteps.) \\n Bardolph: Are you okay, Eve? \\n Evelynn: I… I just need a moment… to regain my composure. \\n Bardolph: Do you need a hug? I give great wolf hugs, or at least I\\'ve been told as much. \\n Evelynn: No, thank you. \\n Bardolph: Whatever you need, I\\'m here for you. \\n Evelynn: Honestly, this isn\\'t the first time I\\'ve been face-to-face with a malicious entity who feigned an intent to kill. You\\'d think I\\'d be used to it by now. \\n Bardolph: You put on a tough front. I can tell. My shoulder\\'s here if you need to cry on it. Trust me, it really does help. \\n Evelynn: I appreciate the kind offer, but I\\'m fine now. We all need to focus on when it eventually comes back. \\n Bardolph: Well, I\\'ll still stay by your side for now. \\n Evelynn: Actually, I think I\\'ll assume Base Form as well, and I\\'d appreciate some privacy. \\n Bardolph: I\\'ll be happy to give you some, and keep watch for anything hostile. \\n Evelynn: Thank you. \\n Bardolph: Lucky you ignored me, kept your sweater and packed your shorts. \\n Evelynn: I do hope Sandra did the same. I don\\'t trust any plant material in this forest now. \\n (Approaching footsteps.) \\n Sandra: Yeah, I wasn\\'t stupid enough to bring my backpack and not pack some of my clothes in it. Couldn\\'t fit my shoes, though. \\n Bardolph: Heh, looks like I\\'m the odd one out, then. Wish I\\'d figured a way to bring at least my underwear. \\n Sandra: Or maybe you just like being naked, you pervert. \\n Bardolph: Could you please stop calling me that?! \\n Sandra: Well, I\\'m not about to be a contestant on Naked and Afraid: Furry Edition. I brought my clothes and more than one item. \\n Bardolph: I\\'ll just stay in my Feral Form, then. Honestly, I can probably do more to help in this form anyway. \\n Evelynn: So, just focus on my humanoid form and activities that only it can physically perform, correct? \\n Bardolph: Pretty much, yeah. \\n Sandra: You can transform and get dressed now, Eve. I\\'ll make sure this pervert… \\n Bardolph: (Yelps.) Ow! \\n Sandra: …doesn\\'t look at you. \\n Bardolph: (Whines.) Stop pinching my ear! \\n Sandra: Yeah? Close your eyes and don\\'t open them until I tell you, or I\\'ll bite it next. Even in this form, I still have a muzzle full of yote teeth. \\n Bardolph: (Whimpers.) I wasn\\'t going to look, but fine. \\n Evelynn: Actually, he said he was going to stand guard. \\n Sandra: Ugh, fine. \\n (Bardolph loudly shakes his head.) \\n Sandra: But I swear, if I see your head swivel more than an inch in our direction. \\n Bardolph: I keep telling you…(Sighs.) Maybe you\\'ll take my word after seeing me keep it. \\n Sandra: Yeah, we\\'ll see. I\\'ll be keeping guard near here, so there should be absolutely no reason for you to look our way, unless you spot something. \\n Bardolph: Yep! \\n (Footsteps fade.) \\n Evelynn: I\\'ve been thinking about what Belette Le Fou(ine) said. Despite the trauma, some things still stood out to me. \\n (Rustling.) \\n Sandra: Well, I\\'ve been thinking about how I can kill that weasel before he kills me or you… Or even Bard, even though he\\'s in the dog house right now. \\n Evelynn: That might not be wise. We don\\'t know if that\\'s even possible, or what would happen to this forest afterwards. If we did somehow neutralize it, the entire area could deconceptualize into unreality and take all of us with it. \\n (Fabric rustling and rubbing.) \\n Sandra: I don\\'t know what any of that means, but I do know that he can be injured. The guards managed to get in a few lucky shots on his leg and arm. In fact, his arm wasn\\'t moving, and its bandage looked huge and sunken. \\n Evelynn: I definitely took notice of that, and how the bandages appeared to be living seaweed. \\n Sandra: Anyway, we might not have what our guards had, but I did notice that weasel got too distracted to cast that kinetic crap when he was fixing up the damage to this little stage he\\'s trying to play with us on. \\n Evelynn: Huh… It\\'s funny that you should describe this forest as a stage. Belette Le Fou(ine) mentioned his \\'people\\' performed a \\'similar experiment\\' on a summer night a long time ago. I wonder if he was talking about a certain Midsummer Night. \\n Sandra: (Laughs.) Seriously?! That\\'s quite a leap! \\n Evelynn: Welcome to the Foundation, where we\\'ve already documented numerous possible connections between the anomalous and works of fiction from antiquity. \\n Sandra: But really, that play is over 500 years old, and its story takes place in Ancient Greece, thousands of years ago. \\n Evelynn: We have already contained many anomalies that are far older than that. \\n Sandra: So you\\'re saying Bottom could have been a Therianthrope. A were-donkey? \\n Evelynn: It is a fascinating possibility, and it opens up the possibility that Belette Le Fou(ine) is a Faerie. \\n Sandra: So wait, even Faeries are real? God, this is all such a head trip. Even literally, since I have a new head! (Chuckles.) Just like Bottom. \\n Evelynn: Unfortunately, the Foundation has very limited knowledge of the Fae, and my knowledge is even more limited, since it\\'s not my department. I was only obligated to learn about Protocol 4000-Eshu, which involves abstaining from using any names, titles, or designations when dealing with certain entities and anomalies. \\n Sandra: Again, seriously?! Names?! Well, in that case, we\\'re already screwed, since we\\'ve been using our own names quite a bit with that weasel around. \\n Evelynn: Yes, it is rather curious, but I believe the protocol is only observed in the presence of the Nameless, and that entity clearly has a Name, Belette Le Fou(ine), and insisted we use it. \\n Sandra: Well, I ain\\'t giving him the pleasure. I saw the way he was looking at me, and he also didn\\'t point out that I was naked until it was convenient for him. The way he was talking about me too… \\n (Sandra loudly shudders.) \\n Sandra: And I thought my ex was bad. Bard may be in the closet, but that guy is out and disgusting. … Though I might have been wrong about Bard after all. Dude hasn\\'t looked over here once, not even for a split second. He\\'s just been staring at the sky. \\n Evelynn: Speaking of which, there\\'s now adequate light that I can begin documenting our surroundings with my camera. Since we\\'re all as decent as we can get, and I have proper hands again, I\\'m going to end the audio log here and begin a video one. \\n (Fabric rustling.) \\n Sandra: Heh, well I\\'m going to start making some spears to gut that fucker, and then carve some curse words into his precious trees. That should hopefully be a big enough distraction for an opening. \\n Evelynn: I still strongly advise against doing that. We should formulate a proper plan with Bardolph first. \\n Sandra: Pssh, fine, whatever. \\n (Tapping.) \\n Evelynn: Ending audio log… \\n <End Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:47 PST> \\n Note: Log created from Video Recording made by Dr. Atticus Rateleken. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:38 PST> \\n (Starts with close-up of forest floor.) \\n Ace: I hope there\\'s enough light to do this now. I\\'m unsure how much my night vision has changed. I also hope my snout works so I don\\'t have to use my stylus. \\n (Video flip transitions to show the head of a Crotalus atrox with a human-esque brow and forward facing eyes staring into the camera.) \\n Ace: Hey, it does! Excellent! \\n (Distant forlorn howl. Ace looks off to the side.) \\n Ace: That sounded like a coyote. I really hope it\\'s who I think it is, and not a wild one. \\n (Ace makes a quizzical expression and flicks his tongue.) \\n Ace: Huh, is that what I look like? Not half bad, all things considered. \\n (Ace opens his mouth wide, unfolding his fangs, and closes it again.) \\n Ace: Very interesting. \\n (Ace repeats the process twice more.) \\n Ace: So that\\'s how I\\'m able to talk. Fascinating hybrid oral anatomy. \\n (Ace shifts his head around, looking at it from all angles.) \\n Ace: Okay, enough self-admiration. This is Dr. Atticus Rateleken, S.C.P. Foundation Researcher, Level 3. In case it isn\\'t already obvious, I am now an SCP-6090-B instance, infection source species: Crotalus atrox, the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake. This video will serve as a continuation of Incident Log 6090-1. \\n (Ace\\'s snout moves towards the camera. Video flip transitions back to a view 10 centimeters above the forest floor. Camera angles upwards to show the surrounding trees in the pre-dawn light.) \\n Ace: This is the forest in which I attempted to hide from the malicious entity that attacked the convoy, self-designation: Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n (Camera swivels to show a tree with a small hole halfway up its trunk.) \\n Ace: That is the tree in which I hid, though my efforts proved futile. At least I know Belette Le Fou(ine) doesn\\'t intend to kill me right away. \\n (Camera moves closer to the hollow tree.) \\n Ace: I will attempt to visually verify and test the anomalous properties of this forest. \\n (Camera points up towards the sky.) \\n Ace: I am going to assume Base Form again to have hands again. \\n (Leaves rustling. Camera swings around wildly as if on a very long self-picture monopod.) \\n Ace: Success! I\\'ll try not to get too much of myself in my shot. \\n (Camera stops moving. View is now 2 meters off the ground, and flip transitions to show Ace\\'s snake head and bare human shoulders.) \\n Ace: Oh good, I got the shot right. If I can just hold my tail in that position, everything should be fine. \\n (Ace runs both hands over his head and neck, which is a much larger version of his Feral Form head.) \\n Ace: Wow, my neck is long! It\\'s got to be around 40 centimeters now. My tail is almost 2 meters in length, so I can easily use it as a selfie stick. \\n (Ace opens his mouth twice again, and wiggles his brows.) \\n Ace: Yep, the expected Theriocephalic anatomy, a hybrid of human and rattlesnake. Anyway, back to the matter at hand. \\n (Ace walks up to the tree and leans against the trunk.) \\n Ace: Nothing seems out of the ordinary. Just a normal stress-induced tree hollow. \\n (Camera shifts view. Tapping. Camera\\'s flashlight activates. Camera is moved to look inside tree hollow.) \\n Ace: Wait, is that writing? \\n (Camera shows a message carved into the interior wooden wall: HOW MANY MORE?) \\n Ace: \\'How many more?\\' Of what? \\n (Camera shifts around to try to spot any other text. There is none.) \\n Ace: I don\\'t recall that text being there when I was inside the tree. Maybe Belette Le Fou(ine) wrote it while talking to me. \\n (Camera pulls back from hollow. Tapping. Flashlight turns off.) \\n Ace: I\\'m going to see if this is actually a tree inside. \\n (Ace ducks down out of frame. Rocks clattering.) \\n Ace: Ah, here\\'s a good one! \\n (Ace reenters frame with a sharp rock and starts scraping away the bark.) \\n Ace: Nope, nothing but ordinary wood, though I can\\'t really analyze it. \\n (Camera moves close to incision, showing innocuous bark and wood.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.76 \\n (Silent push notifications start appearing at the top of the video frame.) \\n Ace: Why would Belette Le Fou(ine) tell me this tree would bite? Why would I believe it? \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.71 \\n (Ace scrapes harder and faster, making exertion noises. Rattling starts.) \\n Ace: That asshole was just messing with me! I can\\'t hide from it. I can\\'t run from it. I\\'m its plaything now until it ends me! \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.64 \\n (Rattling gets louder. Camera starts to vibrate slightly. Ace pants and drops the rock.) \\n Ace: (Sighs.) What am I doing? \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.53 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Yes, what are you doing to one of my trees? \\n (Ace hiss-yells. Camera turns to show Belette Le Fou(ine) standing next to another tree, back in Base Form.) \\n Ace: Ssshit! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I did warn you, didn\\'t I? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) wiggles its fingers. Wood creaks and groans in the background. Camera turns back to the tree. The hollow hole snaps shut and disappears, as if it had never been there. Bark rapidly grows back over the incision.) \\n Ace: Sorry you didn\\'t get the chance to guillotine me. \\n (Camera turns back to face Belette Le Fou(ine).) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Yes, it really is a shame that you actually heeded my warning. \\n Ace: How many more of what? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, so you did see my message! Good. Yes, how many more of so many things. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its hand and a giant toadstool starts growing out of the ground beside it.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): How many more lives will you Jailers ruin? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) sits down on the toadstool and crosses its injured leg over its other one.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): How many more of my people would you ruin if you got the chance? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) doffs its hat, places it on its knee, and lifts it to reveal a saucer and steaming hot cup of tea balanced on it.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): How many more experiments will we conduct before I end your life? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) dons its hat again and takes a polite sip of its tea.) \\n Ace: Why not just kill me right now? Why wait? It looks like your injuries are still getting worse, and you clearly can\\'t use your right arm. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Because it\\'s been so long since I\\'ve had the chance to kill Jailers. I intend to savor it for as long as I can, despite my injuries. Besides, we haven\\'t finished comparing notes yet. \\n Ace: What more is there to compare? I\\'ve already told you everything the Foundation knows about SCP-6090. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) takes another sip of its tea.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Mmmm, you do actually make a good point there, since you Jailers seem to be either tight-lipped or outright ignorant. If anything, I\\'ve actually given you more information. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) sets the teacup back on the saucer and wiggles its fingers. Wood creaking.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.50 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Not that it matters, since none of you are leaving this forest alive. \\n (Camera turns towards the tree trunk Ace has been leaning on. Multiple branches rapidly sprout and wrap themselves around Ace\\'s torso and legs. Ace starts yelling. Rattling intensifies. Video starts to blur from the vibration.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.48 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Perhaps I should just kill you right here and now. \\n Ace: No! Please stop! \\n (Saucer and teacup loudly clink from Belette Le Fou(ine) drinking its tea.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And here I thought a moment ago you were asking me to kill you instead of waiting. Did I mishear you? \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.44 \\n Ace: Please! I don\\'t want to die! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Very well then. \\n (Wood creaking and groaning stops.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.52 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): But first, make yourself decent. I grow weary of your nudity. \\n Ace: And how am I supposed to do that? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): How are you supposed to escape, you simpleton? \\n Ace: Right. \\n (Camera moves in a way indicative of Ace\\'s tail shrinking. Camera moves downward through a series of branches.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Now see, that wasn\\'t so difficult. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) winces in pain.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, how I detest having to be in two places at once. I should probably rectify this issue. \\n (Camera is now 10 centimeters off the ground, and angles up to show Belette Le Fou(ine) finishing its tea.) \\n Ace: So you\\'re about to leave to antagonize my associates again? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Yes, as it seems my ears are burning from your friends being naughty again elsewhere in my forest. \\n Ace: Seems more like it\\'s your wounds that are burning. You really are confident, aren\\'t you? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Always beware that I can kill them and you any time I please, with one arm almost literally tied behind my back, all while enjoying a nice cup of tea. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) doffs its hat and covers the teacup and saucer with it.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I\\'m also not the only one you should be mindful of while in this forest. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) lifts its hat to reveal the teacup and saucer have vanished, and dons it again.) \\n Ace: So you aren\\'t the only sapient hostile entity here? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) winces.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Mmmm, no, I would say that I\\'m probably the only one here with any real intelligence, though not the only hostile one. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Really, you seem to have forgotten all the implications of what you are now. You might be a predator, but you aren\\'t an apex one. \\n Ace: What exactly do you me… \\n (Ace screams. Camera wildly bounces around before facing the ground, which rapidly accelerates away as it ascends into the air.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.64 \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) mockingly waves goodbye, bending his knuckles and keeping his wrist straight.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.77 \\n (Camera shifts up to show a specimen of Bubo virginianus 25, its wings flapping almost silently.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.63 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh my, how exactly are you going to get out of this predicament, I wonder. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.55 \\n (Camera shifts to show Belette Le Fou(ine) flying alongside the owl. Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s normal speaking voice is somehow able to cut through the wind noise. Ace yells back.) \\n Ace: This is your doing, isn\\'t it?! You also control the fauna?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Does it even matter right now? How will you escape? Think, simpleton, think! \\n (Camera swings around wildly. Ace cries out in pain.) \\n Ace: I am not about to become an owl pellet! \\n (Camera shows brief glimpses of two people and a black wolf in a clearing.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Mmmm, it seems this situation will rectify itself rather soon. \\n (Owl screeches and its flight becomes erratic. Ace screams.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.62 \\n (Camera begins rapid descent towards the trees. Leaves rustling. Tree branches breaking.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.74 \\n (Heavy thud. Camera bounces up and down, slips downward and continues tumbling to the ground.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.81 \\n (Video goes dark. Audio picks up muffled shouts of concern.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.72 \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.62 \\n Note: Log created from Video Recording made by Dr. Evelynn Antleur. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-03\\xa004:48 PST> \\n (Starts with a forest clearing, with Bardolph in Feral Form casually sitting off to the right, his head shifting between points in the trees and sky.) \\n Sandra: Hey Bard! You can come back over now! Eve is decent! \\n (Bardolph turns his head to look, smiles, and runs over.) \\n Sandra: First, I want to say I\\'m sorry for doubting you, and calling you a pervert. \\n (Bardolph stops in front of her, panting and wagging his tail.) \\n Bardolph: No worries! I\\'m used to it. Unfortunately, it\\'s still a common misconception about Furries. \\n Sandra: Heh, finally fessing up, I see. \\n (Evelynn clears her throat.) \\n Evelynn: Both of you, please be silent for at least a minute while I make a formal introduction. \\n (Video flip transitions to show a white Dama dama doe head with humanoid eyes and brow, on a human body wearing a black turtleneck sweater dress.) \\n Evelynn: This is Dr. Evelynn Antleur, S.C.P. Foundation Researcher, Level 3. Unfortunately, I am now an SCP-6090-B instance, infection source species: Dama dama, the Fallow Deer. The two other SCP-6090-B instances are my associates. \\n (Video flip transitions back to Sandra, who is snapping off low thick branches. Bardolph is watching her curiously.) \\n Evelynn: Sandra Collins, SCP-6090-B instance 4342, infection source species: Canis latrans, the Common Coyote, and Dr. Bardolph Dalton, employee of Wilson\\'s Wildlife Solutions, infection source species: Canis lupus, the Gray Wolf. \\n (Sandra sits down on the ground, sets the broken branches next to her, takes off her backpack, unzips it and withdraws a multi-tool from it.) \\n Bardolph: Sandy, what exactly are you doing? \\n Sandra: Gonna make some pikes to make that weasel go pop. \\n (Sandra flicks a saw out and begins quickly cutting the ends off the branches.) \\n Bardolph: Sorry, but, are you insane?! You know that won\\'t work, and it\\'ll get you killed. \\n Sandra: And what would you suggest, Bard? Let that asshole torture us for a million fucking years?! \\n (Sandra finishes the last branch, flicks the saw back and flicks out a knife.) \\n Bardolph: We try to find a way out of this place, or at least wait it out until the Supervisors, err, the Foundation, send reinforcements in here. \\n Evelynn: I agree with Bardolph. Please stop this, it\\'s a waste of time. \\n (Sandra starts whittling the smaller ends of the branches into sharp points.) \\n Sandra: And what if those reinforcements never come? What if they can\\'t get in, or they can\\'t find us because that weasel has made this place like a maze? We\\'ve already seen that he has complete control over the trees. \\n Evelynn: The Foundation has countless resources for navigating anomalous, non-Euclidean spaces. There are several Mobile Task Forces that specialize in doing just that. They will be able to reach us, contain Belette Le Fou(ine), and evacuate us from this space. \\n Sandra: Well, I ain\\'t waiting on these \\'task forces\\' to save our asses. We don\\'t know what that thing\\'s going to do to us next, how long he plans on keeping us alive, and if he\\'ll even give us anymore moments alone. I won\\'t be tortured, and I won\\'t go down without a fight. I\\'m sick of this bullshit! \\n (Sandra raises her hackles and growls. Her ears fold back and her whittling becomes more vigorous.) \\n Bardolph: Please, Sandy, don\\'t do this. Belette Le Fou(ine) seems willing to talk, and we can probably keep him talking to drag things out until help arrives. \\n Evelynn: I agree on taking a more diplomatic approach, though with your current mood and attitude, I\\'m not sure that\\'s possible. \\n Sandra: And how long would you two drag things out? You know we\\'ll need to drink after four days, and eat eventually, right? I don\\'t know about you guys, but I won\\'t be consuming anything from this forest. I\\'ve got three protein bars and a water bottle that we stretch as long as we can, but then that\\'s it. \\n Evelynn: You do actually have a point there. \\n (Bardolph whimpers and sulks.) \\n Bardolph: Yeah, haven\\'t had the time to think about that until now. \\n (Sandra chuckles. Her whittling slows, her ears prick back up, and her expression relaxes.) \\n Sandra: Yeah, I do, don\\'t I? Surprised basic bodily needs didn\\'t already occur to someone as smart as you. We\\'ll probably have to sleep in shifts too, and we\\'re already overtired from the road trip. \\n (Sandra speeds up her whittling.) \\n Sandra: And what if, in the process of \\'diplomacy\\' and \\'dragging things out,\\' that weasel serves us up some shit he\\'s done God-knows-what to? Throws us a little tea party? What will you two do then? What if he says he\\'ll kill you if you don\\'t accept it? \\n (Bardolph whimpers louder. Sandra finishes off the last spear and stands up.) \\n Evelynn: I\\'ll politely decline and attempt to shift the subject. \\n (Sandra dons her backpack and keeps her multi-tool in hand.) \\n Sandra: Yeah, good luck with that. I ain\\'t playing along, though. \\n (Sandra picks up the spears with her other arm and starts walking around the outskirts of the clearing.) \\n Bardolph: Maybe she does have a point, Eve. \\n (Sandra drives two spears into the ground behind a tree she didn\\'t damage.) \\n Evelynn: I will try my best to preserve my own life, in spite of her efforts. \\n (Sandra repeats the process with other undamaged trees.) \\n Bardolph: And what about her? \\n Evelynn: She will likely get herself killed if she attempts this folly. \\n (Bardolph whines.) \\n Evelynn: I will do what I can to save her with negotiation, but if it comes down to my life or hers, I\\'ll choose mine. \\n (Sandra runs out of spears, walks over to one of the trees she pulled branches from, and begins carving into its trunk.) \\n Bardolph: Don\\'t talk like that Eve! We\\'re in this together! \\n Evelynn: Again, I will do my best. It would be a shame to lose a subject as unique as her. There\\'s so much we could learn about both SCP-3577 and SCP-6090 by just studying her alone. \\n (Sandra finishes carving an obscene phrase into the trunk. Her ears twitch and swivel as she moves onto the next one.) \\n Bardolph: Is that all she is to you? A test subject? \\n Evelynn: She is an unprecedented sapient instance of SCP-3577. We could be looking at years of research in her case. \\n (Sandra carves into the next tree more intensely than the last, with broader and deeper knife strokes.) \\n Bardolph: Years?! Eve, you can\\'t be serious. \\n Evelynn: Dr. Dalton, from one scientist to another, take my advice: It\\'s best not to get attached to anomalous objects, especially humanoid ones. \\n Bardolph: You know you have to let her leave, under the F.A.C.T. Agreement. \\n Evelynn: Her retroactive reality bending abilities are not fully understood and that makes her a potential threat to herself and others. We are well within our rights to contain her indefinitely under the exception clauses of that Agreement, just as we are within our rights under the Boring Agreement to confiscate and contain any threatening anomalous animals from your organization. \\n (Bardolph whines loudly.) \\n Evelynn: You should be well aware by now that neither the U.I.U. nor W.W.S. have any jurisdiction in her case. \\n (Sandra has since finished off the second tree and moved onto a third, carving into it with noteably excessive force.) \\n Bardolph: What am I supposed to tell her? \\n Evelynn: You don\\'t tell her anything. Just go along with our usual ruses. Stay as terse as you can, nod your head in agreement with us, and gradually break off all contact with her. \\n (Bardolph whimpers.) \\n Evelynn: It\\'s for the best, Bardolph. The Foundation always knows what\\'s best. \\n (Sandra finishes off the third tree and pounds against it with her fist.) \\n Bardolph: (Sighs.) Yeah, I know the deal. I\\'ll do my best, just like with the others. \\n (Sandra stops pounding and takes deep breaths. Her face is in anguish.) \\n Evelynn: Good boy. \\n (Sandra moves onto a fourth tree and stabs into it with her knife.) \\n Evelynn: Well, she seems to be rather upset again. \\n Bardolph: Can you blame her? I mean, given what we\\'re up against. \\n Evelynn: It really is overkill, even for such futile actions. \\n Bardolph: Heh, says the woman who bucked the crap out of a tree trunk when we realized we were trapped here. Cut her some slack! \\n Evelynn: Fair enough. \\n (Sandra finishes carving one curse word into the trunk. She pants and pounds on the tree.) \\n Bardolph: We should focus on what to do when Belette Le Fou(ine) returns. \\n (Sandra relaxes her facial expression and her chest heaving slows.) \\n Evelynn: It would be best if you followed my lead on that as well, unless the situation worsens. In which case, you\\'re welcome to improvise however you like to give us all the best chance of survival. \\n (Sandra walks back towards the camera with a neutral expression on her face.) \\n Bardolph: You feeling better, love? Did you get it out of your system? \\n Evelynn: I trust you\\'re ready to follow our plan, despite how much you may have already compromised it with your actions. \\n Sandra: Yeah, no. You two can sing and dance for that pompous weasel all you want, but I\\'m sticking with my plan. If anything, you\\'ll both probably be a better distraction and give me a better opening to finish what the guards started. \\n Bardolph: Sandy, please don\\'t do this. You\\'ll just get yourself killed. \\n Sandra: No, I\\'m official done with this bullshit. All of it. Either I take that fucker down, or I go down swinging. \\n Evelynn: (Sighs.) It\\'s obvious now I\\'d be wasting my time trying to convince you otherwise. When your brash actions inevitably fail, Bardolph and I will do our best to convince Belette Le Fou(ine) to overlook them and spare your life. \\n Sandra: Heh, it almost sounds like you\\'re actually on his side now. \\n Bardolph: We\\'re on your side, love, and we always will be. \\n Sandra: If you say so. \\n Bardolph: Hey now! We\\'re all in the same boat here. \\n Sandra: Of course we are… \\n (Sandra looks at Bardolph and her expression brightens up.) \\n Sandra: I mean, yeah, with this whole prison and its weasel warden. \\n (Sandra lifts her arms and twirls around.) \\n Bardolph: That\\'s the spirit! Speaking of which, we need to get ready for when Belette Le Fou(ine) comes ba… \\n (Owl screeches. Camera view shifts to show an owl with an elongated object in its talons growing larger. Belette Le Fou(ine) is floating next to it.) \\n Sandra: What the fuck now?! \\n (Owl releases the elongated object, which screams and continues to grow larger and oddly shaped as it falls.) \\n Bardolph: It can\\'t be! \\n (Bardolph runs toward the object as it rustles leaves and breaks branches falling through the trees. Evelynn chases after him with the camera.) \\n Bardolph: Ace! Is that you?! \\n (Object\\'s fall stops on the end of a thick lower branch. It bounces up and down with the object draped over it. A smaller object falls off one end of it.) \\n Atticus: (Coughs.) Who else would it be?! \\n (Atticus is in the form of a Crotalus atrox specimen as large as a full grown Eunectes murinus 26. He has a stunted, scale-covered, human-like upper torso with arms along the length of his body, and an equally stunted and scaly human-like lower torso with legs further down the length of his body.) \\n Bardolph: Oh my God, you\\'re bleeding! \\n (Camera shifts position to show 8 fresh gashes along the length of Atticus\\' body.) \\n Atticus: It\\'s okay. (Coughs.) They\\'re just superficial wounds, or at least I hope they are. \\n Bardolph: They still look pretty bad, and were probably worse before you started transforming. \\n Bardolph: Eve! Tear off your sweater sleeves! I need them now! \\n (Video shifts to a view of the sky as Evelynn sets down her camera. Fabric tearing.) \\n Atticus: Did I even finish transforming? (Coughs.) I feel really weird now, even weirder than when I first became a Therianthrope an hour ago. \\n Bardolph: No, you\\'re in some kind of intermediate form between your Base Form and Feral Form. \\n Atticus: (Winces.) Woah, you\\'re right. I look like some kind of Chinese Dragon Rattlesnake Hybrid. \\n Bardolph: Try not to move right now. I\\'m going to dress your wounds first. \\n Atticus: Shouldn\\'t I simply finish transforming to heal them? \\n Bardolph: No way, mate. We don\\'t know how bad they are. Transforming could make them worse instead of better. \\n (Atticus winces and grunts.) \\n Bardolph: Besides, you got an intermediate form after being a Therian for only an hour! Lucky! \\n (Atticus grunts in pain.) \\n Bardolph: I\\'ve been one for years and I\\'m still trying to develop a good intermediate form for myself. \\n Atticus: I\\'m… not exactly sure how I even assumed this form. I was assuming my Base Form to escape that owl, but I guess I collided with the trees before I could finish transforming. \\n Bardolph: Well, you need to stay in that form until you\\'ve healed a little, and commit it to muscle memory in the meantime, so you can access it in the future. \\n (Atticus winces.) \\n Evelynn: (Sighs.) Bardolph, could you please assume your Feral Form again? \\n Bardolph: Not until I\\'ve gotten Ace down. Ace, you ready? \\n Atticus: Yeah. I think I still have my locomotion gastrosteges, so I should be able to help. \\n Bardolph: Okay, but be careful. I\\'m going to start pulling now. (Grunts.) \\n (Wood creaking. Atticus winces.) \\n Evelynn: Ugh, it\\'s a good thing my phone\\'s camera is pointed skyward right now. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) Mmmm, yes it is. Now the wolf has decided to disregard decency to save his friend. \\n Atticus: You really are a piece of work, you know that? (Winces.) Are you enjoying my suffering? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Very much so! Thank you so much for asking. \\n Evelynn: How long do you intend to keep us trapped in this anomalous forest before you kill us? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): For as long as you humans continue to amuse me, and this right here is quite amusing. (Cackles.) \\n Bardolph: Okay, one last pull. \\n (Atticus winces and yells. Heavy thud.) \\n Atticus: Thanks! \\n Bardolph: Any time! \\n Evelynn: Bardolph, please assume your Feral Form now. \\n Bardolph: Right, will do! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): So it seems my experiment was a success, and my theory was proven correct. \\n Evelynn: Your experiment? \\n (Evelynn lifts the camera off the ground. Video shows Atticus on his ventral side, wiggling his legs and pushing up with his arms to attempt to stand upright.) \\n Atticus: So all this really was your doing? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles. Video pans to show it standing on the ground in front of Atticus and Bardolph.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Since you Jailers have run out of notes to compare, or simply don\\'t want to share, let\\'s make some new ones now! \\n Evelynn: In that case, what was the theory that you mentioned earlier? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): That blunt force trauma applied mid-transformation can stop it halfway and unlock intermediate forms as a result. \\n Evelynn: Huh, very interesting, actually. We hadn\\'t thought of trying such an experiment on an SCP-6090-B instance yet. \\n Bardolph: Eve, you aren\\'t seriously condoning this? \\n Evelynn: No I am not. There are definitely safer, more controlled ways to induce such trauma. Perhaps a Taser. \\n Bardolph: Right, because that\\'s so much better. \\n Atticus: It certainly would have been better than falling through tree branches. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I might not have one of those, but I have so many other, more natural resources at my disposal. There are so many more experiments I can perform! The only question is: What to do to all of you next? (Cackles.) Oh, we\\'re going to have so much fuuuuuUUUUU… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) screams in pain. A wooden spear is now protruding from its left thigh. Silvery blue blood drips from the wound.) \\n Evelynn: That foolish girl really is going through with it. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) ducks down to grab the spear, right as another flies over its back.) \\n Evelynn: I want to apologize for Sandra\\'s behavior! Please don\\'t do anything rash because of her. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) pulls the spear out and screams. Silvery blue blood begins to pour out of the wound.) \\n Bardolph: Holy crap, we really could have a shot! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) looks over in panic and levitates out of the way as another spear flies past him.) \\n Evelynn: Stop it! He will probably kill all of us after this! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) winces and giggles painfully.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You\\'re right to fear me, my dear, and you ne\\'er-do-wells are lucky I still can\\'t use my right hand. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) reaches into its dress jacket, pulls out a seaweed-like substance and applies it to its leg wound.) \\n Bardolph: You aren\\'t keeping us here anymore! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) groans in pain and dodges as Bardolph lunges with his mouth open. The seaweed grows to cover its wound and staunch the bleeding.) \\n Atticus: Heh, judging by the trail, you\\'ve now lost a lot more blood than I have. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) narrowly dodges another spear. It waves its hand and toadstools start growing around it.) \\n Atticus: How does it feel, I wonder. \\n (Bardolph lunges at Belette Le Fou(ine) from behind.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It no longer feels amusing. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) dodges the lunge and waves its hand again. Several toadstool caps detach from their stems and fly through the air.) \\n Bardolph: I\\'m not chasing after your mushroom Frisbees! \\n (Bardolph lunges at Belette Le Fou(ine), but several toadstool caps fly towards him.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): No, but they\\'ll chase after you! \\n (Bardolph manages to catch one flying toadstool cap in his mouth, but two more collide with his torso.) \\n Evelynn: Bardolph! \\n (Bardolph whines in pain and tumbles to the ground. Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and waves its left hand in blurring motions. A spear is stopped mid-flight with a kinetohazard.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Let\\'s have no more of that either, shall we? \\n (The spear drops to the ground. Bardolph shakily starts to stand back up. Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles and looks in Sandra\\'s direction with a malicious grin.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You\\'ve been a very naughty girl. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its hand and Sandra screams. Camera swings over to show tree roots sprouting from the ground and wrapping around her legs.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It seems you\\'ve also carved profanities into several of my trees. \\n (Sandra trips over backwards and falls onto her butt and elbows. Tree roots sprout and wrap themselves around her forearms.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Very naughty indeed. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly flies into view and abruptly stops to float directly above her.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You\\'re such a special girl. It would be a shame if I had to kill you. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) licks its lips and places its tongue on its upper teeth.) \\n Sandra: God, you really are worse than my ex! \\n (Sandra spits on Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s tuxedo jacket.) \\n Sandra: You might call them \\'Jailers,\\' but you\\'re the real \\'Jailer\\' here, imprisoning us in this forest. Sure, it\\'s a picturesque prison, but it\\'s still a prison. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Giggles.) That\\'s enough naughty words out of your dirty muzzle. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its hand. Vines grow out of the ground and over Sandra\\'s shoulder, wrapping around her muzzle.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You know, I don\\'t have to kill you right now. Maybe we can compromise. \\n (Sandra raises her hackles and growls.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Perhaps you\\'ll stop throwing things and behave better if I blinded you. \\n (Sandra whimpers and struggles against the vines. Bardolph growls and barks.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Of course, since I only have one hand, we\\'ll have to do this one eye at a time, but really, it\\'s more enjoyable that way. \\n (Bardolph runs up and lunges at its left arm. Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its left hand and two more toadstool caps collide with him mid-air. They stick to his body and begin clamping down on it.) \\n Bardolph: What the heck?! I can\\'t get them off! \\n (Bardolph whines in pain and collapses to the ground.) \\n Atticus: Bard! \\n (Atticus tries to stand. His body ungulates and falls over.) \\n Atticus: Dammit, my torso\\'s like a wet noodle. I should probably just slither. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) places its left hand on the right side of Sandra\\'s face. Sandra makes a muffled scream.) \\n Bardolph: Oh God, they\\'re breaking my ribs! \\n (Bardolph howls in pain.) \\n Atticus: Hang on, I\\'m coming! \\n (Atticus slithers over to him, dragging his legs but keeping his arms off the ground.) \\n Evelynn: Please don\\'t do this! If you injure Bardolph and impair Sandra\\'s sight, you won\\'t be able to perform as many tests. Isn\\'t that what you want? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): But don\\'t you see, Jailer? I\\'m performing a test right now: testing the pain tolerance of Therianthropes. \\n (Atticus pulls on edge of the mushroom cap with his child-sized arms, but it doesn\\'t budge.) \\n Atticus: Damn baby arms! I don\\'t think I can get them off. \\n (Bardolph whines and coughs.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Keep recording this, so we have all the data, and be sure to get my good side. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) holds his left thumb just above Sandra\\'s right eye, ready to press down.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, and if you even think of interfering, I\\'ll blind you next. \\n Atticus: Please, release these toadstool vices! They\\'re going to crush him! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Sorry, lad, but the wolf, like her, needs to be taught a lesson. \\n (Atticus hisses, opens his mouth, and sinks his fangs into the toadstool cap. It slackens and shrivels.) \\n Atticus: Holy shit, that actually worked! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cringes and winces, removing its hand from Sandra\\'s face.) \\n Atticus: And now the other one. \\n (Atticus bites into the second toadstool cap, causing Belette Le Fou(ine) to wince again as it withers and dies.) \\n Atticus: Bard, are you okay?! \\n (Bardolph takes ragged, raspy breaths.) \\n Bardolph: Right… knackered… (Coughs.) But still alive. (Coughs.) Ribs positively cracked… though. Hard to… (Coughs.) breathe… \\n Atticus: Try not to talk anymore, then. Just focus on staying alive. \\n (Bardolph nods weakly. Belette Le Fou(ine) growls.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): No matter, I can deal with them later. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) smiles, giggles and places its left thumb on Sandra\\'s closed right eye.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Now, where were we, my dear? \\n (Sandra struggles and quietly screams.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, come now, don\\'t fret. You\\'re about to be part of an exciting experiment! \\n CSR-05: HEY! I\\'VE GOT AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU! \\n (Camera turns to show a male Foundation guard with a longhorn bull head, fully armored and loaded out with as many guns and magazines as he could carry, pointing one at Belette Le Fou(ine).) \\n Atticus: What the fuck?! An MTF Minotaur?! \\n CSR-05: Sorry I took so long, I had to prepare. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cackles and releases his hand from Sandra.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Now this is quite the unexpected treat! And here I thought I killed all of you. \\n CSR-05: Frankly, I\\'m just as surprised I\\'m not dead. \\n Atticus: You got infected and transforming fixed your superficial wounds, that\\'s how. \\n CSR-05: Yeah, probably. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) guffaws and climbs off Sandra.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You might not be dead now, but you soon will be. \\n CSR-05: Yeah, we\\'ll just see about that. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And what, pray tell, is this experiment of yours? I hope it\\'s something more creative than just shooting at me. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) wiggles and twists its fingers, blurring them and some of the air around him.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Your fellow guards already tried that experiment, and it thoroughly failed. \\n CSR-05: Nah. Was thinking I\\'d try this first. \\n (CSR-05 quickly swings his arm to point his gun at the tree trunk next to him and fires a few rounds into it.) \\n Atticus: What the fuck?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cries in agony, bending down and grabbing its forearm wound.) \\n CSR-05: Just as I thought. You feel this forest\\'s pain. \\n Atticus: Huh, was starting to suspect that too. \\n CSR-05: Yeah, saw him double over in pain when the Gauss felled a few of the trees. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) looks up at CSR-05 with fury. CSR-05 fires another round. It screams.) \\n CSR-05: Well, I\\'m about to cause you a whole lot more pain for what you did to my team. \\n (CSR-05 looks at Atticus and pulls out a serrated knife.) \\n CSR-05: Dr. Rateleken, get yourself and Dr. Dalton to cover. \\n (CSR-05 looks at Evelynn, shoots the tree again and tosses the knife to her side.) \\n CSR-05: Dr. Antleur, free the coyote girl and do the same. \\n (CSR-05 shoots the tree twice more and turns back to Belette Le Fou(ine).) \\n CSR-05: And as for you, I\\'m just getting started. LET\\'S FUCKING GO! \\n (CSR-05 grabs a second gun with his other hand, shoots two other trees and runs out of sight. Belette Le Fou(ine) shakily stands and levitates after him.) \\n Atticus: Come on, Bard, you gotta try to stand. \\n (Evelynn grabs the knife and cuts the base of the vine wrapped around Sandra\\'s muzzle. It withers and falls away.) \\n Sandra: I almost lost an eye! You can keep filming this shit after freeing me. \\n Evelynn: Right, of course. \\n (Evelynn sets the camera down to face the sky again. Gunfire and Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s laughter continue throughout.) \\n Sandra: Free my left arm first and hand me my multi-tool. It\\'s right over there. \\n Evelynn: Yes, I see it. \\n … \\n Sandra: Thanks! Now get started on my legs. I\\'ll free my right arm. \\n Evelynn: That was my plan too. \\n … \\n Sandra: Finally! I guess this is one time you\\'re willing to set me free. \\n Evelynn: I don\\'t know what you mean by that, but we need to get to cover now. \\n (Evelynn comes into view of the camera and picks it back up. Belette Le Fou(ine) chases after CSR-05, occasionally stopping to cringe in pain.) \\n Atticus: Over hear! Hurry! \\n (Bardolph leans against a large boulder, raggedly breathing. Atticus is feeling Bardolph\\'s chest for damage.) \\n Atticus: I hope that weasel can\\'t control rocks too. \\n (Sandra runs over to them with Evelynn following.) \\n Sandra: We need to figure out how to kill that thing. Maybe if we wreck the forest enough. \\n Evelynn: I\\'ll remind you the entire forest could collapse in on itself if it dies. \\n Sandra: I don\\'t know about you, but that weasel\\'s probably gonna kill us after this. \\n (Camera turns to show CSR-05 knocking over some smaller trees with his bare hands while shooting larger ones.) \\n Sandra: If you\\'re right, we\\'re dead either way, so who cares? \\n Evelynn: My plan is to let the guard handle containing Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Sandra: This is our endgame and we need our own plan, or we\\'re all dead. \\n (CSR-05 discards a spent gun and grabs another.) \\n Sandra: That guard doesn\\'t have infinite ammo, and I don\\'t know what his plan is other than making an opening for us. \\n Atticus: I could bite Belette Le Fou(ine). My venom would knock him flat, but it probably wouldn\\'t kill him. \\n Evelynn: Hmmm, that may actually work. Crotalus venom isn\\'t immediately fatal. Can you control the dosage? \\n Atticus: I can\\'t say it\\'ll be very accurate. Only thing I\\'ve bitten were those mushroom vices. \\n Evelynn: Try not to send it into shock if you can. That should ensure its organs remain undamaged for long term containment. \\n Sandra: Wow, that is literally all you think about, isn\\'t it? \\n Evelynn: Securing and Containing the anomalous to Protect the rest of the world is the Foundation\\'s primary directive. \\n Sandra: And you never think beyond that, do you? \\n Atticus: Now is really not the time for this debate! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): (Cackling.) Looks like you\\'re almost out of ammunition. What then? \\n CSR-05: Well, I find out the secret to your amazingly high pain tolerance. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Honestly, I\\'ve grown numb to the pain by now. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm and toadstool caps fly at CSR-05.) \\n CSR-05: Guess I should slow down to let your pain receptors recover. \\n (CSR-05 shoots down the toadstool caps.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): The moment you slow down is the moment you die. \\n CSR-05: Okay, I\\'ll speed up then! \\n (CSR-05 weaves through the trees at a sprint, outrunning the caps as they collide with trunks.) \\n Evelynn: Impressive physical enhancements. \\n Atticus: They\\'re moving so fast, I don\\'t know how I\\'ll even get close. \\n Sandra: I still have some spears hidden around here. \\n Atticus: Go use them! Eve, make a distraction! \\n Evelynn: What am I supposed to do?! \\n Atticus: What you do best: lecture him! \\n (Sandra runs off. Atticus pets Bardolph.) \\n Atticus: Looks like some bruising and hairline fractures at worst. Just, try to stay out of sight, okay? \\n Bardolph: Will… do… \\n (Atticus slithers off. Evelynn runs out into the field.) \\n Evelynn: Why not spare him for your experiments?! He\\'s another Therianthrope now, after all! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) stops, winces in pain and turns towards Evelynn with a malicious grin.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh no, my dear. He\\'s far too naughty to let live. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) wiggles its fingers into blurs. Several bullets and a spear are stopped by kinetohazards.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): In fact, so is everyone else here. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm and toadstool caps fly towards Evelynn.) \\n Evelynn: Wait, I never attacked you! \\n (Kinetoglyphs vanish. The bullets and spear drop to the ground.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): But you no longer amuse me. \\n (Evelynn rapidly leaps and dodges several toadstool caps.) \\n Evelynn: Huh, I\\'ve never been able to move and jump like this before! \\n (Evelynn starts laughing as she dodges more toadstool caps.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You\\'re quite the agile deer, my dear. Let\\'s do something about that! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm. Evelynn trips, falls, and yells.) \\n Evelynn: Please, no! \\n (Toadstool caps are shot apart before they reach Evelynn. Her ankle is twisted and trapped under tree roots.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): You shouldn\\'t be a problem now. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) lands on the ground next to Evelynn. It cringes and groans in pain.) \\n Evelynn: What are you going to do to me? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) giggles and wiggles its fingers, stopping several more bullets mid-air.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Why, the same thing I was about to do to the coyote, of course. \\n Evelynn: Please don\\'t, I\\'m much more valuable sighted. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) cries in pain. Gunfire in the background.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): But first, I\\'ll handle the other nuisances. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) rapidly gesticulates its entire left arm, blurring the air around itself as the still floating bullets begin the gyrate.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It seems that you\\'re almost out of ammunition. How about I do you a kindness, and… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) makes some final motions and the bullets rapidly fly back towards CSR-05.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): …return some of it to you! \\n (CSR-05 screams as one hits his shoulder and another his stomach. He fires the gun in his other hand at Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s head.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Again with the headshots? \\n (CSR-05 pulls out a piece of metal with a cloth wrapped around it as he starts to collapse.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): What do you hope to accomplish? I\\'ll stop anything you throw at m… \\n (CSR-05 throws the metal with all his might as he falls. The cloth unravels mid-air, revealing markings on it drawn in blood.) \\n Evelynn: Antikinetoglyphs… \\n (Green kinetoglyphs appear around it as it gets close. They instantly disappear and the metal keeps moving, embedding itself into Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s thigh, just above its knee.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): What the…?! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) makes a blood curdling shriek and collapses. Silvery blue blood seeps from the wound as the surrounding tissue inflames and blisters.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Oh, my Queen! IT BURNS! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) grabs it with both hands, but pulls them away seconds later and screams again. Second degree burn marks are visible on both its palms.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): PLEASE! SOMEONE! MAKE IT STOP! OH, MY QUEEN, IT BURNS SO BAD!! \\n (Evelynn dislodges her foot, crawls over to Belette Le Fou(ine) and punches it in the eye.) \\n Evelynn: That\\'s for threatening to blind me! \\n (Evelynn sits up and looks down on him.) \\n Evelynn: I look forward to studying you in containment. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) laughs weakly in between grunts of pain.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And how… are you… going to… contain me? \\n Evelynn: Immobilization via Crotalus venom. Dr. Rateleken, you may administer the injection now! \\n (Atticus slithers out from behind a nearby tree, having regained his phone.) \\n Atticus: With great pleasure, Dr. Antleur. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.64 \\n (Atticus slithers close to Belette Le Fou(ine) and lunges, sinking his massive fangs into its shoulder. It gurgles and screams.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.52 \\n Evelynn: That should be more than sufficient. \\n (Atticus pulls out after a quarter second. Belette Le Fou(ine) reaches up and grabs Atticus by the neck.) \\n Evelynn: I\\'ll knock you out personally, you cretin! \\n (Atticus chokes and coughs. Evelynn makes a fist and readies herself.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I\\'ll strangle just one more Jailer before I… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) curtly releases Atticus, seizes up, and shrieks in agony.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.66 \\n Evelynn: Atticus, just how much venom did you give him? \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s superficial blood vessels turn black around its bite wound. This quickly spreads throughout its body.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.73 \\n (Atticus coughs in between words.) \\n Atticus: I was careful… to minimize the… dose… Of course, I didn\\'t… know it\\'d go for my… throat! \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) screams as fur starts to shed from its head and its face distorts.) \\n Evelynn: What in the world?! \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.85 \\n Atticus: Eve, you\\'re still… recording all of this… right?! \\n Evelynn: Of course! I never stopped. I trust you are as well? \\n Atticus: Yes I am, but we need to document this thoroughly! \\n (Rapid footsteps approaching.) \\n Sandra: What did I miss?! Did we finally get hi… WHAT THE FUCK?! \\n Evelynn: Absolutely fascinating! \\n (Sandra pulls out her own phone and starts filming.) \\n Evelynn: Yes, thank you, Sandra. We need to observe this from multiple angles. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine)\\'s face shifts to resemble a humanoid with high cheekbones and pointed ears.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.91 \\n Evelynn: I definitely wasn\\'t expecting this. \\n Atticus: Neither was I. \\n Sandra: What the fuck did you two do to him?! \\n Atticus: I bit him. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) stops screaming and pants. It reaches up to feel its face.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It… can\\'t… be… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) waves its arm and everyone jumps back.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 0.95 \\n Sandra: Don\\'t try anything stupid! \\n (A small puddle of water seeps up from the ground next to Belette Le Fou(ine). He leans over and looks into it.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It is… I\\'d forgotten… how handsome I looked. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) groans and falls back down. Parts of its body begin to fade and visually distort.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.09 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): All my pain is gone… and soon I will be too. \\n Sandra: What the absolute fuck is happening to you? \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): I\\'m deconceptualizing. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.14 \\n Sandra: What? \\n Evelynn: Ceasing to exist. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Without my original Name or my Queen\\'s curse, there isn\\'t enough to maintain my existence. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.27 \\n Evelynn: You should have fully deconceptualized by now, which concerns me about the integrity of this place. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): My paradoxical Name is delaying the process, but it won\\'t hold. \\n Sandra: All this stuff about Names again?! \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.33 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): My original Name was the key to my existence, the key to me. Without it, only a mere patchwork kept me going. \\n Sandra: Seriously?! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): It\\'s the case with everyone! \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.49 \\n (The visual distortions become worse, and more parts of its body fade away.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Always cherish your Name, and keep it hidden from those who would steal it. \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) turns to Evelynn with a cheeky grin.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.54 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): And you have nothing to worry about, Jailer. We\\'re still in your reality. \\n Evelynn: But this area is Non-Euclidean. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Just part of the magic. You\\'ll all survive, and bare witness to my death. \\n (Sandra moves in closer and re-angles her phone.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.62 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): That\\'s right, keep filming and don\\'t look away. None of you look away! \\n Atticus: I wasn\\'t planning to. \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): Good. You Jailers always need a reminder. This is the truth your Foundation keeps hidden, even from its own. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.71 \\n (The video itself begins to distort as pockets of unreality consume its body.) \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): This is what you Jailers did to millions of my people over a century ago, on behalf of the Factory. \\n (Only a few scattered parts of Belette Le Fou(ine) remain.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.76 \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): We will destroy the Factory, and we will destroy you Jailers too, if you get in our way again. \\n Atticus: Who\\'s \\'WE\\'?! \\n Belette Le Fou(ine): We are… the Mabbites…\\nThe Mabbites…\\nThe Mabbites…\\nThe Mabbites… \\n (Belette Le Fou(ine) fades out of existence. His last words continue to echo as the plants wither and die all around them.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.48 \\n Evelynn: He said this place wouldn\\'t collapse! \\n (All the trees shed their leaves, shrivel up, fall over and rot away into nothing.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.29 \\n Atticus: I think it\\'s just the plants that are collapsing. \\n (Nothing remains but rocks in a vacant field. The road is 0.5 kilometers away.) \\n Sandra: The road was right freaking there?! God, now I know how the people on Lost felt. \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.12 \\n (The roots under the trucks and covering the MTF Trailer dissolve away. The battery fire reignites from air exposure.) \\n K.C.Alert: Hume at 1.00. Reality Nominal. \\n Bardolph: Is it… finally… over? \\n (Bardolph stumbles towards the group and CSR-05 crawls over to them.) \\n Atticus: Bard, try to conserve your strength! \\n (Atticus falls over and curls around to touch his bloody bandages.) \\n Atticus: Shit! All that slithering reopened my talon wounds. \\n Bardolph: Heh… Guess we\\'re both… pretty knackered now. \\n (Bardolph falls over next to Atticus. They both laugh weakly.) \\n CSR-05: Well that was quite the ordeal. \\n Evelynn: Are you alright Terr… Convoy Guard Five? \\n CSR-05: I\\'ve been worse. \\n Evelynn: Unfortunately, I have also sustained an injury. \\n CSR-05: Don\\'t worry. Help should be here soon from the nearest Provisional Site. \\n Evelynn: Any ETA? \\n CSR-05: Still can\\'t get a signal, but the sun\\'s almost up, so it\\'s been about… 75 minutes. \\n Atticus: Damn. All that in just an hour. \\n CSR-05: Shouldn\\'t be much longer now. \\n Atticus: Good. We could all use medical, except Sandy. \\n CSR-05: The coyote girl? \\n Atticus: Lucky girl, especially since she came within an inch of losing an eye. \\n CSR-05: Why is she walking toward the road, anyway? \\n Evelynn: Sandra! What exactly are you doing? \\n Sandra: Oh, just uh… getting a closer look at that battery fire. \\n (Sandra stops walking and puts her hand above her eyes.) \\n Sandra: I really hope it doesn\\'t spread into the field now. \\n Evelynn: And what exactly is that in your other hand? \\n (Sandra tightens her grip on a large, antique compass in her other hand.) \\n Sandra: What, it\\'s just my phone. \\n Evelynn: That doesn\\'t look like your phone. \\n Atticus: Sandy? What are you doing? \\n CSR-05: Wait, that\\'s a Lewis & Clark Compass! \\n Evelynn: How did you even get that?! \\n Sandra: (Sighs.) Probably the same way I got my binoculars. \\n Evelynn: You couldn\\'t have possibly bought something like that, which means… \\n Sandra: That somehow, some way, in the past I just rewrote with my new magical coyote powers, I stole it from that other guard. \\n Evelynn: And what were you planning on doing with it? \\n Atticus: Wait… you had that escape device this whole time, and didn\\'t share it? \\n Sandra: No! I only just now found it in my backpack… though I was thinking about it the whole time we were in there. I must have made the compass appear inside it the same way I got my binoculars. \\n Evelynn: So you could have gotten us out the forest this whole time?! \\n Sandra: I don\\'t know?! Didn\\'t the guard say it only works on one person, anyway? \\n Evelynn: You could have given it Dr. Dalton or myself to escape and contact reinforcements. \\n Sandra: Maybe I… just wanted to keep it for myself. \\n Evelynn: Sandra Collins, I sincerely hope you aren\\'t thinking about escaping. \\n Atticus: Sandy, please, don\\'t do this. \\n Evelynn: Can you stop her?! \\n CSR-05: Don\\'t think so. Out of ammo and anything I can throw. I don\\'t even think I can stand, but I\\'ll damn well try. \\n (Sandra takes a few steps back and starts fiddling with the compass.) \\n Bardolph: Sandy… \\n (CSR-05 strains to get up, but falls back down again. Atticus starts to slither forward, but stops and grabs his wounds.) \\n Sandra: I\\'m sorry, Bard. I really hope you, at least, were looking out for me in the end, but I heard your conversation with Eve. All of it. \\n (Bardolph whines. Sandy continues to walk backwards, looking between them and the compass.) \\n Evelynn: I suspected you might have, but I still didn\\'t think you\\'d be reckless enough to even consider this. \\n (Evelynn tries to stand, but yells and falls when she puts weight on her ankle.) \\n Sandra: From the moment I woke up with this face, I knew I would never lead a normal life again. But you, Bard, and the other Therians, at least gave me hope that I could lead some kind of life looking like this. \\n Bardolph: You… still… could… \\n Sandra: But before that, when I first saw myself in the mirror, only one thought came to mind: I\\'m a freak now, and the government is going to haul me away to a lab somewhere, and poke and prod me until the day I die, or the day they decide to dissect me. \\n (Evelynn tries to stand again, but falls and begins crawling her way towards Sandra.) \\n Sandra: I even had nightmares about it the first few nights, but even then I never thought they\\'d turn out to be premonitions. \\n Evelynn: Think carefully about what you\\'re about to do, SCP-6090-B instance 4342. You will become a criminal, and the U.I.U. won\\'t be on your side anymore. \\n Sandra: From what I heard you say, they were never on my side, and neither were you, and I would never have a future outside of my nightmares. \\n Atticus: That thing is random. What if you end up in the middle of nowhere? Or worse, in a city or any kind of crowd? \\n Sandra: If it\\'s the former, then I\\'ll live as a wild coyote for a while. They have pretty good range. And if I thread that needle and get the latter, well, it is what it is, and I\\'ll find a way to deal with it. \\n Evelynn: You won\\'t get far. We can track your phone! \\n Sandra: Yeah, my phone\\'s a TeraCube 2e, and I\\'ve already taken its battery out, so no power to track it. \\n (Evelynn crawls closer, but Sandra jumps backwards.) \\n Sandra: I\\'m sorry, but the fact I was even able to rewrite the past to somehow steal this thing is a sign. These magic powers seem to run on my greatest desire, and right now my greatest desire is the freedom to chart my own course in life… with this compass. Heh. \\n Evelynn: We will find you and contain you. It\\'s only a matter of time. \\n Sandra: Eve, I really feel sorry for you. I don\\'t know who hurt you, but I hope someday you realize how much you\\'re hurting others. \\n Atticus: Sandy, I\\'m sorry you feel that way about the Foundation. \\n Sandra: Ace, I really hope you\\'re better than she is, but I\\'m not sure anymore. Never really got to know you, and now I won\\'t get the chance. \\n (Evelynn stands and tries to hobble towards her, only to fall down after a few steps.) \\n Sandra: I might not ever be able to get my old life back, but I\\'ll be damned if I live my worst nightmare for the rest of it. Even if you guys catch up to me, I\\'ll just use the compass again. And if that doesn\\'t work, well… I guess I\\'ll just off myself, if only to rob you of your precious \"unprecedented sapient instance of SCP-3577,\" or whatever you want to call me. \\n (Clicking noise. Sandra\\'s expression brightens. The compass\\' North and South poles split apart and begin rotating in opposite directions.) \\n Sandra: Yes! Finally! \\n (Evelynn stands up and starts walking, groaning in pain with each step. Sandra turns and runs away.) \\n Evelynn: You aren\\'t escaping! \\n (Compass\\' arms speed up into a blur. Sandra vanishes. Evelynn falls down, rolls on her back, and cries while clutching her ankle.) \\n Evelynn: CSR-05… make sure to… log Sandra Collins… SCP-6090-B-4342… as a Person of Interest… \\n (The sun rises. Shortly after, a black unmarked MRAP Truck27 crests over the hill on the road.) \\n CSR-05: Yeah, I\\'ll get right on that… when I\\'m not lying on the ground in pain. \\n (The MRAP Truck drives off the road just before reaching the convoy remains and stops in front of the group.) \\n Atticus: At least the cavalry\\'s finally here, albeit late. \\n (The MRAP Truck flashes the Foundation symbol on its side. Agent Benson and several other armed guards disembark and survey the situation.) \\n Benson: Woah, never thought I\\'d be attending a furry convention out in a field. Then again, these days it is best to keep events like this outdoors. \\n Atticus: Is that really what this looks like to you?! \\n Benson: Come on, you\\'re all half-animal, and it looks like you all partied pretty hard. \\n (Benson gestures towards the still-burning battery fire.) \\n Benson: You even started a battery bonfire! That\\'ll sure be fun to put out. \\n CSR-05: Of all the agents they could have sent, why\\'d it have to be you, Benson? \\n Benson: Funny enough, because I sleep through most of the day. I\\'m actually good to go around sunrise. \\n (The other guards walk around and begin scanning fingerprints and implanted RFID chips.) \\n Benson: I just happened to be on another mission over at Site-███ when I got called out here… \\n (Benson leans over and scans Evelynn\\'s fingerprints and RFID chip.) \\n Benson: Oh hey, that really is you Dr. Antleur! Looks like you went from towheaded to doe-headed. \\n Evelynn: Very funny. In case you haven\\'t noticed, we all need medical attention. \\n Benson: Yeah, that\\'s pretty clear. You guys must have been up against something fierce. \\n (Two guards carefully load CSR-05 onto a stretcher and into the MRAP Truck.) \\n Atticus: We managed to neutralize it. \\n (Benson stretches and contently groans.) \\n Benson: Glad I didn\\'t have to fight it. \\n Evelynn: I need you to put a Foundation BOLO Alert on SCP-6090-B-4342, Sandra Collins. \\n Benson: Right, the… uh… \\n (Benson checks his tablet.) \\n Benson: Coyote Girl… Therianthrope, that was with you. Suspected to have SCP-3577\\'s powers. \\n Atticus: You\\'re only just now reading the mission briefing? \\n Benson: Hey, they scrambled us shortly after your signal was lost. Barely even had time to get dressed. \\n Atticus: And how long was the drive? \\n Benson: Took over an hour. You\\'re out in the ass-end of nowhere. \\n Atticus: And you didn\\'t think to read it en-route? \\n Benson: Nope, not really. So anyway, why didn\\'t any of you think to slip a tracker on her? \\n Evelynn: We had nine armed guards at the time, and we assumed we could just her track her phone if she somehow managed to evade all of them. \\n Benson: And you can\\'t track it now because…? \\n Evelynn: She removed the battery. \\n Benson: Was it an older phone? \\n Atticus: New one. \\n (Atticus grunts as he\\'s manually coiled onto a stretcher.) \\n Benson: Did she mention the brand? \\n Atticus: TeraCube, I think. \\n Benson: Huh, I\\'ll have to look into that. \\n (Two guards lift Atticus up and haul his stretcher into the MRAP Truck.) \\n Benson: Well, I can understand why you guys didn\\'t think to check her phone for such a feature. Most new phones suck these days. \\n Evelynn: And that\\'s why we need to get a BOLO on her ASAP. \\n Benson: I\\'ll do what I can, but maybe next time, slip backup trackers on your guests. \\n Evelynn: It\\'s been noted. Now, shouldn\\'t we be getting an aerial medical evac instead? \\n Benson: The boys have already radioed one in, along with a clean-up team for this mess. \\n (Two guards finish getting Bardolph onto a stretcher and into the MRAP Truck.) \\n Benson: Medical will intercept us on the way back. Gotta cover as much ground as we can in the meantime. \\n Evelynn: The sooner we get back to the Site, the better. \\n Benson: Aw, and here I was looking forward to us having a nice hour-long chat. \\n Evelynn: I wasn\\'t. \\n (Benson leans down and gestures to help her up.) \\n Benson: You need a hand, or do you want the stretcher? \\n Evelynn: If it gets us into the vehicle faster, I\\'ll take your hand. \\n (Benson lifts up Evelynn and she leans on him.) \\n Benson: Woah, slow down there Doc. I don\\'t exactly feel the same way about you. \\n Evelynn: Your wit knows no end, Agent Benson. \\n Benson: Heh, I do my best. \\n (They enter the MRAP Truck and Evelynn shakily sits down next to the rest of the group.) \\n Evelynn: Ending video log… \\n <End Log, 2021-06-03\\xa005:31 PST> \\n Section 5: Post-Incident Report \\n Following evacuations and clean-up of Incident 6090-1, survivors were assessed for injuries and debriefed. \\n Dr. Atticus Rateleken exhibited large scratch wounds, which proved to be mostly superficial and required only minimal medical intervention. Regardless, he chose to remain in his Hybrid Form for the duration of a week, in order to \"commit it to muscle memory,\" and ordered clothes tailored for it. During this time, he and Dr. Antleur collaborated on analyzing the anomalous properties of his venom and its potential to create a cure for SCP-6090, based on its observed effects on Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Dr. Evelynn Antleur exhibited damage to several ligaments of her left ankle, and was given appropriate treatment. Despite the need for crutches, she insisted on assisting in the development of a potential cure for SCP-6090. Together with Dr. Rateleken, they isolated several specialized anomalous oils, toxins and prions that, in high enough concentrations, specifically target and neutralize SCP-6090 both outside and within human cells, without causing additional harm to the tissue. \\n Through testing with infected D-Class, this cure was demonstrated to completely eliminate the DNA template overwrites of SCP-6090 and, through means not fully understood, causes any SCP-6090-B instance to rapidly revert back to its original non-anomalous human form. Further testing is still underway for lingering side-effects from this potential cure and after-effects from SCP-6090 infection. Dr. Antleur herself will be part of these tests on a two month long trial uncured and an additional month after being cured. \\n Dr. Bardolph Dalton sustained several bruises and hairline fractures to his ribs, and was treated by Foundation veterinarians. He will be required to remain in Feral Form during recuperation. His communications will be closely monitored by the Foundation for any attempts to contact PoI-6090-4342, Sandra Collins, for a period no less than 15 months, or until the containment of PoI-6090-4342. \\n Convoy Security Retinue Guard 05, Agent Terrance Neilson, sustained several injuries from redirected gunshots, though his armor reduced their severity. He was allowed a week to recuperate before being debriefed. He will be given an additional month to reach full convalescence. He will then be redeployed uncured on a trial basis, to field test the capabilities of Bovine SCP-6090-B Field Agents, for a period of no less than 3 months. \\n Regarding the Mabbites. Regarding the Mabbites. Regarding the Mabbites. They will henceforth be referred to as GoI-3903. This is to prevent the demonstrated Echoing Nomenclative Hazard that is conceptually attached to the group\\'s name. Little is currently known about GoI-3903, but based on information gathered by the U.I.U., it is currently believed to have formed within the last year, with its membership consisting mainly of Unseelie Fae. Investigations are currently underway with assistance from the U.I.U., who have far more experience in dealing with Fae criminals.28 \\n Section 6: Debriefing Logs: \\n Interviewed: Dr. Atticus Rateleken, Foundation Therianthropy Researcher, Level 4\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-4344, ISS: Crotalus atrox29 \\n Interviewer: Dr. Gerhard Harkhart, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3 \\n Note: Dr. Rateleken is still in the Intermediate Form he obtained during Incident 6090-1. A set of clothes and a long lab coat have been tailor made to fit his rather unique anatomy and proportions. He is to remain in this form until such time that he has fully recovered from his injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to resume his Base Form. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-06, 14:01 PST> \\n Dr. Harkhart: Hello, Dr. Rateleken! This is my first time interviewing a Therianthrope, so go easy on me. \\n Dr. Rateleken: (Laughs.) Happy to have you visiting the Therianthropy Department, Gerry! \\n Dr. Harkhart: Oh, well, thank you for using my first name. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Please, there\\'s no need to be so formal around me. I find that formalities tend to hinder productivity. You can call me Atticus or Ace if you want. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Awesome! Also, it\\'s really cool that you\\'re able to move and stay upright in a form like that. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, well, I\\'ve gotten the hang of controlling the muscles in my snake torso in tandem with moving my legs. Standing in this form sorta makes me look like that one TMNT villain with the long torso… Drago…? Draco…? Something like that. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Oh my gosh, I think I remember that from my childhood! \\n Dr. Rateleken: Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. \\n (Dr. Rateleken winks. Dr. Harkhart laughs.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Well, I don\\'t think I\\'m quite ready to do kung fu in this body yet. Just being able to sit and stand upright is enough for now. \\n (Dr. Rateleken adjusts himself in his seat, and winces as he feels his injuries. Dr. Harkhart stops laughing.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Are you okay? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Yeah, I\\'m fine. My injuries are already a lot better than they were three days ago. \\n Dr. Harkhart: I thought Therianthropes could heal superficial wounds by shape-shifting. \\n Dr. Rateleken: I actually find this form rather interesting, and I want to commit to muscle memory first, so I can assume it in the future. The pain from my wounds has helped me to not accidentally shift back into my Base Form. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Wow, being a Therianthrope sure is interesting. \\n Dr. Rateleken: You\\'re always welcome to have that interesting experience for yourself. \\n (Dr. Rateleken winks again. Dr. Harkhart chuckles nervously.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Well, maybe later, after you\\'ve managed to find a cure for SCP 6090 infection in humans. That\\'s actually what I was supposed to ask in this interview: How has research into that been going? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Very well, actually! I\\'m thankful to have Dr. Eve Antleur assisting us in the Therianthropy Department. Despite how cold she can be, she is rather brilliant. \\n (Dr. Harkhart chuckles again and rubs the back of his neck.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Yeah, I\\'ve actually worked with her quite a bit. She can be a bit… distant, but after a while you get used to it. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, I\\'ll have to take your word on that one. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Yeah… Getting back on topic, I\\'ve heard that if you do create a viable cure, the higher-ups are considering reclassifying SCP-6090 from Keter to Thaumiel. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, probably because of the potential \"super soldier\" prospects. Personally, I\\'d think Cernunnos would be a better Containment Classification now. Even with a cure, we\\'ll probably never locate every SCP-6090-A instance, and there are many SCP-6090-B instances who chose to become infected and would refuse it. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Yeah, I can see how that would be an ethical and logistical nightmare that qualifies for Cernunnos. Still, from the amazing things I\\'ve learned about Therianthropes, they could be help the Foundation contain all sorts of anomalies. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, perhaps a new Containment Classification is in order then? A combination of Thaumiel and Cernunnos, perhaps? \\n Dr. Harkhart: SCP-6090 may be unique enough to warrant that. It would be so cool if I could help design the new Containment Classification! \\n Dr. Rateleken: Well, let\\'s not get ahead of ourselves here. We\\'re still in the process of analyzing my venom, based on the rather interesting effect it had on Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Dr. Harkhart: The entity that attacked the Foundation convoy and tried to kill all of you? \\n Dr. Rateleken: That\\'s the one! It turns out my venom has a lot of interesting properties. We\\'ve managed to isolate a cocktail of anomalous oils, toxins, and prions that appear to be derived from the conventional components of non-anomalous Crotalus venom. It seems my body naturally produces them. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Wow, that\\'s so cool! \\n Dr. Rateleken: I\\'ll say! We\\'ve found that this organic chemical cocktail specifically targets not only the Therianthropy Virus itself, but also all of the structures within cells created by it that give us our abilities, while seeming to leave the rest of the cell and overall tissue intact and unharmed. \\n (Dr. Harkhart suppresses a laugh.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Heh, so what you’re saying is that Therianthropy could actually cured by… \\n (A grin spreads across Dr. Rateleken\\'s rattlesnake snout as he picks up on Dr. Harkhart\\'s cue.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: That\\'s right! Were-Rattlesnake Oil! It\\'ll cure what ails ya! \\n (Both Dr. Rateleken and Dr. Harkhart burst out laughing.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Oh, Gerry, those rumors about you are so misfounded. \\n (Dr. Harkhart stops laughing.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Wait, there are rumors about me? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Oh, it\\'s mainly stuff I\\'ve been hearing from Eve. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Really? \\n Dr. Rateleken: She\\'s actually compared me to you a few times, so I\\'m actually glad I got to meet you myself. \\n (Dr. Harkhart awkwardly rubs the back of his neck.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Heh, well, at least I\\'m glad to hear that she knows me well enough to mention me in conversations with others, even if in an unflattering way. \\n Dr. Rateleken: I can now see why she\\'d make those comparisons, and I can also see that she really doesn\\'t have any sense of fun or humor. \\n (Dr. Harkhart chuckles and sighs.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Yeah, well, for all her faults, Dr. Antleur really is a good person at her core. It just takes a while to get there, you know? \\n Dr. Rateleken: I guess I just haven\\'t spent enough time with her then. Her being a Reluctant Were-Deer probably isn\\'t helping things either. \\n (Dr. Harkhart looks down forlornly.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: I can only imagine how she\\'s feeling right now. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Well, you could always ask her yourself. After all, don\\'t you two work at the same Site most of the time? \\n Dr. Harkhart: Yeah, we do. We, Dr. Sawkingbark and I, actually came up here to check on how she and Agent Neilson are doing after Incident 6090-1. We\\'ll be reporting things back to the higher-ups through the channels at our Site. Of course, Dr. Sawkingbark got the luck of the draw and will be interviewing both of them. \\n (Dr. Rateleken smiles smugly and bends his long neck down to rest his snake head on top of his interlocked hands while looking up at Dr. Harkhart.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: And you got stuck with me. \\n (Dr. Harkhart leans back in shock and laughs nervously.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Not that that\\'s a bad thing! I love getting to interview you. \\n (Dr. Rateleken chuckles and returns his head to a more normal position.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: I\\'ll take your word on that too, Gerry. And anyway, you really don\\'t need a formal interview as an excuse to talk with her. \\n (Dr. Harkhart rubs the back of his neck.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Yeah, well… \\n (Dr. Rateleken frowns.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Hmmm, yeah, I suppose with someone like her, you probably do need something more official to break her rather thick ice shell. \\n (Dr. Rateleken smiles.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: Though I suppose I could arrange something. After all, you\\'re both visiting the Therianthropy Department now, a Department I\\'ll soon be leading here at Site-64. \\n (Dr. Harkhart\\'s face brightens with excitement.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Oh, I\\'ve heard! Congratulations on the promotion! \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, thank you, though I\\'ve been working towards it for a while now, as well as working up the courage to become a Therianthrope myself. Not only have I become one now, but I\\'ve also become the main source for the cure. Given all of that, I\\'d say my promotion is well deserved, wouldn\\'t you? \\n Dr. Harkhart: Definitely! \\n Dr. Rateleken: I\\'m glad you agree, though a few of the other Therianthropy Researchers are still a little sour that I passed them over for it. They\\'ll just have to deal with it, along with the changes I plan on making to whip this place into shape and make it more productive. \\n (Dr. Rateleken chuckles and winks. Dr. Harkhart laughs along with him.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Well, I\\'m sure you’d be a lot more fun to work under than my Supervisor. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Oh, I definitely plan on being a fun yet firm Department Head, but we\\'re getting off topic. Did you have any other questions for me, Gerry? \\n Dr. Harkhart: Oh, right! So, uh, Dr. Rateleken… umm, Atticus, have you been experiencing any negative side-effects from SCP-6090 infection? \\n Dr. Rateleken: This intermediate form has taken some getting used to, but other than that, not really. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Great to hear! Any unusual compulsions or weird dreams? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Heh, I\\'ve actually been craving higher temperatures. I might not be cold-blooded in this form or my Base Form, but it still doesn\\'t stop me from wanting to seek out warmth. \\n (Dr. Rateleken points at the pits on the sides of his muzzle, just behind his nostrils.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: I can even sense heat now to seek it out, whether it\\'s body heat, computer heat, or any other heat source. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Wow, that\\'s so cool! So you\\'re like the Predator now? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Nothing like that, thank the Gods. Augmented vision I can never turn off would probably drive me insane after a while. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Then how does it work? \\n Dr. Rateleken: Like a literal 6th sense, a form of intuition. It\\'s sort of like when you feel like someone\\'s watching you. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Really? \\n Dr. Rateleken: That\\'s the best way I can describe it, only in my case I\\'d likely be able to quickly find the hiding spot of whoever\\'s watching me. \\n Dr. Harkhart: I\\'ll admit, being a Therianthrope does have its perks. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Again, you\\'re welcome to join us any time. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Not gonna lie, it\\'s something to think about in the future. Still, I\\'m not sure about not looking like myself anymore. \\n Dr. Rateleken: That\\'s okay. It took me years, and even now I still needed a dangerous situation to finally push me over the edge. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Anyway, speaking of Reluctant Therianthropes, I unfortunately have to ask you about your thoughts on Sandra Collins, SCP-6090-B Instance 4342. \\n Dr. Rateleken: I honestly wouldn\\'t worry too much about her. I\\'ve brushed up on the abilities of SCP-3577 instances, and I personally think the rest of the Foundation is making a mountain out of molehill in her case. \\n Dr. Harkhart: And her threat to commit suicide before escaping? \\n Dr. Rateleken: She honestly didn\\'t seem like the suicidal type to me, though all Reluctant Therians tend to go through a difficult time after infection. Compound that with what COVID-19 has forced us all to go through, and the prospect of containment would wear on anyone\\'s sanity. \\n Dr. Harkhart: And that really doesn\\'t concern you? \\n Dr. Rateleken: In the long term: No, it doesn\\'t. I might not have gotten to know her as well as the others, but she hardly strikes me as the \"Child God\" type, both personality-wise and power-wise. \\n Dr. Harkhart: But in the short term? \\n Dr. Rateleken: I\\'d rather we take a wait-and-see approach. Locate her, but don\\'t contain her. Observe her from afar. The Foundation is certainly capable of that, even if it does come with a higher price tag and more logistical overhead than immediate containment. I personally feel it would be the better option in her case. \\n Dr. Harkhart: And when she\\'s exposed to her first full moon? I\\'ve heard that can be a real problem for new Therianthropes. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Hope she\\'s found support by then, and if she hasn\\'t, or if she\\'s one of the unlucky violent ones, intervene and contain her. The same applies if she breaks the Veil, which will certainly make finding her easier, or if she does, in fact, attempt suicide. But again, I don\\'t think that\\'s likely. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Are you sure that\\'s a wise decision? \\n Dr. Rateleken: I may also be a new Therian who hasn\\'t experienced a full moon yet, but I can assure you that I have far more experience with Therianthropy than anyone else here, just not first-hand experience. \\n (Dr. Rateleken gestures to his long torso.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: However, I\\'ve been given the rare privilege to get first-hand experience with an intermediate form right off the bat. That should more than make up for it. I\\'ll use my new power to try to sway the higher-ups towards my plan. \\n Dr. Harkhart: Well, good luck with that. Believe me, I know how difficult that can be sometimes. \\n (Dr. Rateleken smiles smugly.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: You know, if you hate your boss that much, you can always put in for a transfer to my Site\\'s Therianthropy Department, and work under me. \\n (Dr. Rateleken winks.) \\n Dr. Rateleken: And if you want to truly join us, we could even make your own SCP-6090 infection go smoothly and painlessly, and you could pick any species you want, even an anomalous one… within reason. \\n (Dr. Harkhart laughs nervously and starts to get up out of his seat.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: A kind offer, but I\\'ll stick with my current position for now. Honestly, I was lucky to get it this early in my Foundation career. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Whatever you say, but my door\\'s always open if you change your mind. \\n (Dr. Rateleken and Dr. Harkhart share a chuckle.) \\n Dr. Harkhart: Anyway, I think I have all the info I need for now. \\n Dr. Rateleken: Thanks for the interview! I look forward to the next one. \\n <End Log, 2021-06-06, 14:07 PST> \\n Interviewed: Dr. Bardolph Dalton, Wilson\\'s Wildlife Solutions Employee\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-863, ISS: Canis lupus30 \\n Interviewer: Dr. Ralph Moreau Bouruson, Foundation Therianthropy Researcher, Level 3\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-1234, ISS: Ursus maritimus31 \\n Note: Dr. Moreau is in his Base Form. Dr. Dalton is still in his Feral Form, and will be required to stay in that form until such time that he has fully recovered from his injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to resume his Base Form. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-07, 11:03 PST> \\n Dr. Moreau: Greetings, Dr. Bardolph Dalton, SCP-6090-B Instance 963. \\n Dr. Dalton: And hello to you, Dr. Ralph Bouruson, SCP-6090-B Instance… 1234, if I recall correctly. \\n (Dr. Dalton chuckles. Dr. Moreau growls.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Yes, that is my own Therianthrope Instance Number, but I prefer to go by Dr. Moreau. \\n Dr. Dalton: Ah, that\\'s right. Bet you\\'re thrilled Ace passed you over for Therianthropy Department Director. \\n (Dr. Moreau growls louder.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Dr. Rateleken is merely the interim director until his reaction to full moonlight is assessed. \\n Dr. Dalton: Well, from what I\\'ve heard, your reaction sets the bar pretty low. \\n (Dr. Dalton winks. Dr. Moreau clears his throat with a growl.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Let\\'s not stray from the topics of this interview, shall we? \\n Dr. Dalton: No worries. What do you wanna know? \\n Dr. Moreau: First of all, I trust you have been recuperating well? \\n Dr. Dalton: Heh, no thanks to your cold-handed veterinarians. I can only imagine how they treat animals who can\\'t communicate with them. I still wish you\\'d let some W.W.S. vets take a look at me. \\n Dr. Moreau: I assure you, Dr. Dalton, the veterinarians assigned to Site-64 are among the best the Foundation, and even the world, has to offer. You\\'re in capable hands for as long as you\\'ll be staying with us, and the fact that you can communicate makes them even more capable of helping you. \\n Dr. Dalton: More like cold and rough hands, but hopefully that stay won\\'t be much longer. \\n (Dr. Dalton smirks smugly.) \\n Dr. Dalton: And as for their capabilities, feel free to compare the results of our vets with yours on any number of anomalous critters we\\'ve had to handle together. \\n (Dr. Dalton winks and Dr. Moreau rolls his eyes.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Even after your stay here ends, I trust you understand that you\\'ll have to remain in your Feral Form until your full convalescence, despite the inconveniences of that. \\n Dr. Dalton: Maybe it\\'s an inconvenience for you, given how massive your Feral Form must be, but for me, it\\'s normal life. I actually spend more time in this form than I do in my Base Form. No worries. \\n Dr. Moreau: Good. I\\'m glad we have an understanding on that front. Now I need to ensure that we also have an understanding regarding Person of Interest 6090-4342, Sandra Collins, SCP-6090-B Instance 4342. \\n (Dr. Dalton\\'s ears droop and he whimpers sadly.) \\n Dr. Moreau: I sincerely hope you understand the full weight of your situation in regards to her. It\\'s still inconclusive whether you deliberately did anything to aid in her escape from containment, even after thorough analysis of all records of Incident 6090-1. However, your overall attitude towards her does raise our suspicions, but I\\'m giving you a chance to alleviate them. \\n Dr. Dalton: Look, you don\\'t need to worry abou— \\n (Dr. Moreau loudly clears his throat with a bear growl and raises his hand in a stopping gesture.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Dr. Dalton, please refrain from speaking out of turn. I\\'ll ask the questions, and you\\'ll answer them. Understood? \\n (Dr. Dalton whines and slowly nods his head.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Good boy. Now, at any point during Incident 6090-1, did you intend to aid PoI 6090-4342 in any way that would go against the Foundation\\'s intentions for her? \\n Dr. Dalton: No, not at all. You\\'re our Supervisors, and your word is final. \\n Dr. Moreau: It\\'s good you understand your place and the place of Wilson\\'s Wildlife Solutions. Would you care to explain your negative attitude towards Dr. Antleur when she was explaining this to you during the Incident? \\n (Dr. Dalton growls softly.) \\n Dr. Dalton: Just because we have to obey your commands, doesn\\'t mean we still don\\'t like them, or even agree with them sometimes. I\\'ll be frank: Sometimes you Supervisors don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, especially when it comes to dealing with anomalous animals. \\n (Dr. Dalton chuckles and smirks.) \\n Dr. Dalton: Like I said earlier, I think the record of W.W.S. compared to yours speaks for itself in that regard. Still, often you all still insist on learning that the hard way. \\n (Dr. Moreau loudly scoffs with a guttural growl.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Be that as it may, I trust you will obey all of our commands when it comes to actions towards PoI 6090-4342. Do we make ourselves clear? \\n Dr. Dalton: Clear as day, Dr. Moreau. I have no intention of going against the Foundation. \\n Dr. Moreau: Good. Again, just to be clear, do you have any intention of aiding PoI 6090-4342 in continuing to evade Foundation containment? \\n Dr. Dalton: No, I don\\'t. I\\'ll say this again and again, but I hope you won\\'t make me say it too many times more. It\\'s still a might difficult for me to speak. \\n Dr. Moreau: I am well aware of the state of your ribs, Dr. Dalton, but not so much your state of mind. Still, I will try to keep this brief. \\n Dr. Dalton: Thank you. \\n Dr. Moreau: Do you still intend to communicate with her in any way? \\n Dr. Dalton: No, not unless she reaches out to me. \\n Dr. Moreau: And I trust you are aware that we will be monitoring ALL of your communications for the next 15 months or until PoI 6090-4342 is successfully contained, correct? \\n Dr. Dalton: Yeah, I figured you\\'d be doing as much. No worries. \\n Dr. Moreau: And if she attempts to contact you? \\n Dr. Dalton: I\\'ll record the whole thing, do my best to convince her to turn herself in, and pass it on to you guys. \\n Dr. Moreau: Recording it and contacting us won\\'t be necessary, since we will be monitoring all of your communications in real time, but it\\'s good that you still offered. \\n Dr. Dalton: Heh, you guys really don\\'t skip a beat, do you? And for 15 months? Color me impressed. \\n Dr. Moreau: It\\'s what we typically do when handling cases like this, Dr. Dalton, though it\\'s actually easier for us in your case, since we already monitor all communications going through the Veil of Secrecy to an extent. We\\'ll just be scrutinizing yours a little more closely for a while. \\n Dr. Dalton: Still impressive. It\\'s one of the reasons why I know it would be stupid to go against the Foundation in any way. \\n Dr. Moreau: I\\'m glad you feel that way, Dr. Dalton. And finally, what is your overall opinion towards PoI 6090-4342? Particularly, how to do feel about her threat to commit suicide if we should come close to containing her? \\n Dr. Dalton: (Sighs.) Can you really blame me for still feeling sorry for that poor girl, especially after that final threat of hers? Can you blame me for disliking and disagreeing with your intentions to contain and study her for years in a dull and sterile lab? \\n Dr. Moreau: Dr. Dalton, despite appearances, I can assure you that the Foundation does take the mental well-being of sentient and sapient anomalous entities very seriously, especially if they threaten suicide. I\\'ll remind you that we do, in fact, have an Ethics Committee that dictates how we may treat such entities. \\n Dr. Dalton: Heh, it can be really hard to believe that sometimes, Dr. Moreau, especially since we at W.W.S. often get a front row seat to how your organization treats \"anomalous entities\" capable of feeling pain. Still, at least you are better than the G.O.C. \\n (Dr. Dalton looks down, folds back his ears and growls.) \\n Dr. Dalton: If I ever have to deal with those bloody bastards again in my lifetime, it\\'ll be too soon. \\n Dr. Moreau: Then I\\'d advise you to always keep that in mind too, Dr. Dalton. Despite what you might think of how we treat anomalous animals and humanoids, always remember how they\\'re treated by the Global Occult Coalition, by Marshall, Carter, & Dark, and by many of the other less savory Groups of Interest. \\n (Dr. Dalton shuts his eyes and growls louder.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Need also I remind you of what Are We Cool Yet did to those platypi and kiwis for the sake of that \"Art from Down-Under\" exhibition of theirs? Much more cruel than cool, if you ask me. \\n Dr. Dalton: Those finger-painting hacks… \\n Dr. Moreau: Never forget, we are the ones who assist your organization in rescuing animals from those organizations. Our only intentions are to securely contain and study the anomalous ones, which is much better than the fate that would befall them otherwise. Wouldn\\'t you agree? \\n (Dr. Dalton stops growling, sniffles, and looks up.) \\n Dr. Moreau: And the same goes for Ms. Sandra Collins. We don\\'t fully understand the extent of her powers. Even if she proves to be less powerful than we think she is, she still has power now. You\\'ve witnessed that power with your own eyes. \\n (Dr. Dalton nods and wipes his nose with his forepaw.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Think of how these other groups would exploit those powers. Do you want her killed by the G.O.C.? Trafficked by M.C.&.D.? Made into \"art\" of some kind by A.W.C.Y.? I could go on, but I think you get the point by now. \\n Dr. Dalton: Yeah, I do. Granted, some might treat her differently since she started as human, but I don\\'t want to take that risk. \\n Dr. Moreau: I know you ultimately want her to be able to live a normal life, but she isn\\'t normal anymore, even by Therianthrope standards. \\n Dr. Dalton: Just promise me something. \\n Dr. Moreau: I cannot make promises on behalf of the Foundation, but depending on your request, I\\'ll see what I can do. \\n Dr. Dalton: I\\'ve heard from Ace… from Dr. Rateleken, that they\\'ve got a cure for Therianthropy in the works. Promise me that once you\\'re done studying her, even if that takes years, you\\'ll cure her and amnesticize her, so that she can live a normal life. \\n Dr. Moreau: You know I can\\'t promise that. \\n (Dr. Dalton whines, stands up in his chair and leans forward with a pleading expression.) \\n Dr. Dalton: Can\\'t you just infect another time-hopping coyote, another SCP-3577 instance, with the Were-Virus, then infect another person who\\'s actually willing to subject themselves to your experiments? \\n Dr. Moreau: We will take that into consideration, but we would only be able to release Ms. Collins after confirming her abilities are able to be at least adequately, if not exactly, replicated in other subjects. Even under controlled conditions, cross-testing anomalies is often a logistical and bureaucratic nightmare, so even creating more like her for the sake of sparing her from our experiments would be a tall order. \\n (Dr. Dalton sits back down, looks down and whimpers.) \\n Dr. Dalton: I understand. It\\'s just… she didn\\'t deserve this. She didn\\'t ask for this. \\n Dr. Moreau: Reality Benders rarely ever do. However, our job now is to contain her before even more innocent civilians end up with something they didn\\'t deserve or ask for. Keep this in mind too: What do you think will happen if we fail to contain her before the next full moon? \\n (Dr. Dalton looks up and whines.) \\n Dr. Moreau: She has had no training or support on how to handle herself should she be exposed, and given her current situation, exposure is very likely. You and some of the other Therians who accompanied you might have given her some advice in passing, but I think we both know that won\\'t be enough. \\n Dr. Dalton: I know you\\'re right there, but I didn\\'t want to think about that. \\n Dr. Moreau: And this is why you need to set your emotions aside and analyze the situation logically. You may see us as cold, but that\\'s what we do, and it should be obvious now we have greater insight into the situation because of that. \\n (Dr. Dalton nervously shifts in his chair and his tail tucks between his legs.) \\n Dr. Dalton: Almost all new Therianthropes need to undergo at least one controlled and closely supervised exposure to full moonlight, to assess how it affects them and whether any medication or even physical restraint is necessary. For most, it\\'s a subtle compulsion, but for some, it\\'s much stronger. You know I\\'m right. \\n (Dr. Dalton looks down and whimpers.) \\n Dr. Moreau: If I recall correctly, due to the unusual circumstances of her SCP 6090 infection, she doesn\\'t even remember it, so she doesn\\'t even have that experience to help control herself. She\\'s a complete wildcard, and when that\\'s potentially coupled with her retroactive reality bending abilities… \\n Dr. Dalton: Yeah, I see where you\\'re going with this. \\n Dr. Moreau: Then you can see why it\\'s critical we contain her within the next fortnight. \\n Dr. Dalton: She didn\\'t really seem like the type that\\'d get violent under the full moon. \\n Dr. Moreau: For everyone\\'s sake, I hope you\\'re right. If she does turn violent, it will make containing her alive much more difficult, but at least it will make locating her a lot easier. \\n (Dr. Dalton looks up and whimpers.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Speaking of which, we may need to call on you directly to assist us with that. You are the most familiar with her behaviors, and more importantly, her scent. \\n Dr. Dalton: Can\\'t you just get other dogs and Canine Therians to sniff any of her clothes you\\'ve nabbed? She did leave her shoes behind, after all. \\n Dr. Moreau: Sure, we\\'ve already recovered her personal effects, but their scent won\\'t be as strong and familiar, and they don\\'t know her like you do. \\n (Dr. Dalton softly growls.) \\n Dr. Dalton: I don\\'t think her seeing me helping you guys out would do us any good. \\n Dr. Moreau: Who says she has to see any Foundation Agents? If you were to, say, confront her alone, give her the right disinformation, and lead her into a trap we set… \\n (Dr. Dalton growls louder.) \\n Dr. Dalton: You cheeky bastards really have already planned all of this out. \\n Dr. Moreau: Again, Dr. Dalton, before your emotions get the better of you and you begin reassessing your loyalties, keep in mind everything we\\'ve discussed here. This is ultimately the best option for her at this point, and hopefully we can find her before another GoI does, and before the next full moon. \\n (Dr. Dalton stops growling and sighs.) \\n Dr. Dalton: I know. And if you do end up having to use me as bait, it won\\'t stop me from hating every minute of it. \\n (Dr. Dalton huffs and smirks.) \\n Dr. Dalton: And who\\'s to say I wouldn\\'t botch being bait because I\\'m as \"over-emotional\" as you say? \\n Dr. Moreau: Oh, don\\'t sell yourself short, Dr. Dalton… or should I say \"Bard the Wonder Wolf\" of Wilson\\'s Wildlife Solutions? \\n (Dr. Moreau smugly smiles. Dr. Dalton frowns and glares at him.) \\n Dr. Moreau: Oh, the children so do enjoy those little educational shows you put on for them. You\\'re the \"most life-like special effect\" their parents have ever seen. I\\'d hate for those shows to have to stop because we\\'ve reassessed their risk to maintaining the Veil of Secrecy. \\n Dr. Dalton: Entertaining kids is a lot different from lying to adults. \\n Dr. Moreau: It doesn\\'t change the fact that you do have acting experience, which we will utilize if necessary. Consider yourself on standby, on top of being monitored. \\n Dr. Dalton: (Growls.) Are we done here? \\n Dr. Moreau: We are for now, Dr. Dalton. \\n Dr. Dalton: Good. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ll return to that cold little \"containment unit\" you Foundation folk consider a luxury accomodation for VIPs like me. \\n Dr. Moreau: You\\'re excused, Dr. Dalton. This interview is now over. \\n <End Log, 2021-06-07, 11:17 PST> \\n Interviewed: Dr. Evelynn Antleur, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-4343, ISS: Dama Dama32 \\n Interviewer: Dr. Elizabeth Sawkingbark, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3 \\n Note: Dr. Antleur is in her Base Form, and will be required to stay in that form until such time that she has fully recovered from her injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to shape-shift. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-08, 13:01 PST> \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Wow, Dr. Antleur. I never thought I\\'d be interviewing you. How\\'ve you been holding up? \\n Dr. Antleur: Better than expected, considering I\\'m now an SCP-6090-B instance with a twisted ankle. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Aww, I think you look cute as a fallow doe. At least they managed to find you a matching wig. \\n Dr. Antleur: Admittedly, it does help me feel more human. Still, let\\'s try to keep this interview professional, Dr. Sawkingbark. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: (Clears throat.) Right. So, Dr. Antleur, have you experienced any adverse effects from becoming infected? \\n Dr. Antleur: Aside from no longer looking like myself, not really. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: No unusual dreams or daytime compulsions? \\n Dr. Antleur: Possibly an increased desire to be outside, in habitats natural to Dama dama, but other than that, nothing noticeable. Right now, I have a much greater desire to develop and test a functional cure with Dr. Rateleken. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: I know you want to go back to your old self, Dr. Antleur, but you need full convalescence first. \\n Dr. Antleur: I am well aware of the potential risks of being cured during my ankle\\'s recuperation, Dr. Sawkingbark, but judging by your expression, there\\'s more to this than that. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well… \\n Dr. Antleur: Get on with it, Dr. Sawkingbark. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: The higher ups want to test the physical enhancements of Cervine Therianthropes. \\n Dr. Antleur: And why did they not inform me of this directly? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: They wanted to assess your reaction to the news in the interview. \\n Dr. Antleur: (Sighs.) And they can\\'t just use D-Class infected with the Dama dama Variant derived from my blood? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well, they will be using D-Class, but having a Researcher as a test subject is quite a bonus for any SCP experiment. \\n Dr. Antleur: Yes, I suppose it is. What are the details of these tests? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Basically physical stuff, to test your agility and jumping abilities, as well as your vision and other senses. \\n Dr. Antleur: Anything else? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: They also want to perform a psychological evaluation during a full moon exposure. \\n Dr. Antleur: (Sarcastically.) I\\'m sure that will be riveting. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: But the good news is that after all that, you\\'ll be given the cure, so that they can compare, and you\\'ll assist them in monitoring yourself for any side-effects from it, or lingering effects from SCP-6090 infection. \\n Dr. Antleur: If it gets me back to being human as soon as possible, I\\'ll submit to whatever tests are deemed necessary. \\n (Dr. Antleur pauses to feel her face.) \\n Dr. Antleur: I have to admit that becoming an SCP-6090-B instance has piqued my personal curiosity. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: See, now that\\'s the spirit! And again, you do look cute as a deer. \\n (Dr. Antleur smiles.) \\n Dr. Antleur: If you find my appearance so appealing, you\\'re always welcome to infect yourself with the Dama dama Variant and join me. Then we could have two Researchers as test subjects. \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark laughs nervously.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: I\\'m not ready to make a commitment like that just yet. \\n Dr. Antleur: I thought as much. Now, is there anything else to discuss or questions to answer? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well, regarding Sandra Collins… \\n Dr. Antleur: I actually need to go check for any updates on the status of PoI 6090-4342. \\n (Dr. Antleur starts reaching for her crutch.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Dr. Antleur, you really shouldn\\'t get too hung up on her. \\n Dr. Antleur: On the contrary, Dr. Sawkingbark, you and the rest of the Foundation should be just as concerned about her as I am. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: The proper departments are handling her case now, Dr. Antleur. \\n Dr. Antleur: They obviously aren\\'t handling it well enough, since she hasn\\'t been apprehended yet. \\n (Dr. Antleur strains to get out of her seat and stand with her crutch.) \\n Dr. Antleur: We have proof from a third copy of her backpack\\'s Contents Manifest paperwork that she indeed used SCP-3577\\'s powers to obtain the Lewis & Clark Compass from CSR-07, a powerful anomalous artifact she could use to further evade containment. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well, that is true, but I\\'ve been told that counter-measures are already being taken against that. \\n (Dr. Antleur hobbles over to Dr. Sawkingbark\\'s side of the interview table and stands over her.) \\n Dr. Antleur: And what about her retroactive reality altering abilities? She has also since altered the past to make \"emergency\" withdrawals from her bank accounts in early 2021, long before the Foundation froze them. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: With all due respect, Dr. Antleur, from what we know about SCP-3577, her powers are actually rather limited, and we\\'ve dealt with more powerful containment breaches before. \\n (Dr. Antleur stares down Dr. Sawkingbark.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Why are you so obsessed with her? Is it because she threatened suicide before escaping? \\n (Dr. Antleur looks down and sighs.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: It\\'s okay, Eve… uhh, Dr. Antleur. That concerns me too. \\n Dr. Antleur: No, it was… something else she said before escaping. \\n (Dr. Antleur leans over as much as her crutch will allow and looks Dr. Sawkingbark in the eyes.) \\n Dr. Antleur: Tell me, Dr. Sawkingbark. Do you think we hurt people here? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: That\\'s a bit of a loaded question, given what the Foundation sometimes has to do to Secure and Contain, but it\\'s always to Protect humanity. \\n Dr. Antleur: Do you think I\\'ve ever hurt anyone? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well… sometimes you could try to be just a little friendlier, especially when dealing with humanoid skips. \\n Dr. Antleur: Have I ever hurt you, Lizzy?! \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: No, Eve, never! You\\'re my friend! Sure, sometimes you\\'re cold, but you\\'ve never been cruel. \\n Dr. Antleur: (Sighs.) Thank you, Lizzy. I needed to hear that. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Anytime, Eve. I\\'m always here for you, no matter what you look like. \\n <End Log, 2021-06-08, 13:05 PST> \\n Interviewed: Convoy Security Retinue, Guard Five, Agent Terrance Neilson\\nInstance SCP-6090-B-4345, ISS: Bos taurus33 \\n Interviewer: Dr. Elizabeth Sawkingbark, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3 \\n Note: Agent Neilson is in his Base Form and will be required to stay in that form until such time that he has fully recovered from his injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to shape-shift. \\n <Begin Log, 2021-06-10, 10:04 PST> \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Terrance! I\\'m so glad they\\'re finally letting me interview you. \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark hugs Agent Neilson.) \\n Agent Neilson: Heh, not much of a choice, since I\\'ve been laid up for a week with my injuries. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: I really hope you\\'re doing better now. \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark ends the hug and steps back.) \\n Agent Neilson: A lot better, though I\\'m still a minotaur. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well, you make a very good looking min— err, Bovine Therianthrope. \\n Agent Neilson: Hopefully I won\\'t be one for much longer, if what I\\'ve heard is true. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Yeah, about that… \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark looks forlornly at the floor.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: We have been seeing positive results with the SCP-6090 Cure derived from Dr. Rateleken\\'s venom. \\n Agent Neilson: But… \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: (Sighs.) The higher ups wanted me to be the one to tell you that you will be rotated through a few M.T.F.s and missions, on a 3 month trial basis, in order to assess the capabilities of a Bovine Therianthrope Field Agent. \\n Agent Neilson: Yeah, I was starting to figure something was up. This ain\\'t just about me recovering from my injuries. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Yes, you\\'ll also have to spend another month healing up before the trial period even begins. \\n Agent Neilson: And then they\\'ll probably move on to making it permanent. \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark looks up and rapidly waves her hands.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: No, no, Terrance, of course not. In fact, now that we have a working cure for SCP-6090-B instances, the higher ups are considering reclassifying SCP-6090 as Thaumiel. It could be used to create specialized agents, and cure them when they want or need to be human again. \\n Agent Neilson: And so they\\'re using me as a test subject. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: But they\\'ve assured me you\\'ll be cured after the trial ends! After all, with your record, you\\'d be better for missions that need you to look, well… human. \\n Agent Neilson: Heh, I really hope that\\'s the case. Still, this isn\\'t the worst thing to happen to me working for the Foundation. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: I guess this means we\\'ll have to cancel our plans for a while. \\n Agent Neilson: Nonsense! I\\'ve been looking into some places in Three Portlands we can visit. After all, I\\'m going to have to live there for as long as the Foundation wants to keep me looking like this. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: You know, I\\'ve actually been meaning to visit that place for a while now. \\n Agent Neilson: Great, it\\'s all working out then! Anyway, isn\\'t this supposed to be an interview? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: You\\'re right. (Clears Throat.) Agent Neilson, please explain why you were M.I.A. during the attack on the convoy by the entity Belette Le Fou(ine). \\n Agent Neilson: Just before it happened, I went back from the truck into the groom area of the L.A.A.T. Trailer to check on the SCP-6090-A instances, since they seemed to be getting riled up by something. Then the ride gets bumpy, the trailer starts pitching like it\\'s in river rapids, a whole steer slams into me and everything goes black. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: And after that? \\n Agent Neilson: I awoke to the sound of the gunfire, so I knew shit had already gotten bad. I felt weird and there was a whole steer on top of me. I\\'m lucky parts of the trailer stopped it from crushing me. Getting it off me seemed easier than it should have been. Don\\'t get me wrong, it was still like moving a mattress, but not that difficult. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: And why did you fail to make contact with the rest of Convoy Security Retinue after freeing yourself? \\n Agent Neilson: My radio was damaged in the wreck, and I wasn\\'t sure how injured I was. Then I got a glimpse of my reflection. \\n (Agent Neilson reaches up and feels his face.) \\n Agent Neilson: I was scared they\\'d mistake me as another hostile, so I decided to hang back and see how I could aid from afar so they\\'d know who I was. I poked my head out as much as I could while trying to keep these damn oversized horns hidden. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: And what did you see? \\n Agent Neilson: A complete cluster fuck. That thing picking off my teammates one by one, flying through the air, and casually strolling through a barrage of Minigun rounds. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: So what did you do to try to render aid? \\n Agent Neilson: At first, I wasn\\'t sure what I could do. I figured if I went out there, I\\'d be a goner like the rest. Then I started to recognize how it was cheating: Kinetohazards. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Could you explain more about your prior knowledge of Kinetohazards? \\n Agent Neilson: Well, I first learned about them from the intel on that incident with Site-13. If something\\'s powerful enough to give even Tau-5 a run for their money, it\\'s worth studying. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: How were you able to recognize the ones Belette Le Fou(ine) was using? \\n Agent Neilson: They got pretty huge and recognizable when it started using them to block the Gauss rounds. I got to work writing out the Antikinetoglyphs with the steer\\'s blood, on fabric I pulled from my dead partner\\'s uniform. Took quite a few tries before I had them written right. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: And why didn\\'t you use it on Belette Le Fou(ine) right there? \\n Agent Neilson: Didn\\'t get a good opening. I was left with only one ribbon tied around a piece of steel I\\'d salvaged from the truck, and I knew I had to be close to use it. By the time I\\'d finished, it\\'d already finished killing my team and scaring off the civilians. It walked over to the first trailer and started trying to put out the battery fire. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: I\\'m no soldier, but that seems like a good opening to me. \\n Agent Neilson: Believe me, I thought so too, but that damn entity was hypervigilant. It kept looking around in frustration with each failure to snuff that fire. It was all I could do to keep hidden whenever it looked my way, since I had a freaking chandelier on my head. \\n (Agent Neilson grabs both his horns and swings his arms off them.) \\n Agent Neilson: I didn\\'t even have a working gun on me, since both mine and my partner\\'s had gotten buried in the wreck. Shame, since I could have blinded it with its own Kinetoglyphs like the others thought to do. \\n (Agent Neilson closes his eyes, tightens his grip on his horns and twists his hands in frustration.) \\n Agent Neilson: Still, I sat there for a solid 10 minutes, waiting for a good chance. I still regret not taking one. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Don\\'t say that, Terr— Agent Neilson! You made the right decisions in the end and managed to save everyone as a result. I won\\'t judge you like others would. \\n (Agent Neilson sighs, opens his eyes, releases his grip and drops his arms.) \\n Agent Neilson: Well, you\\'re probably biased in that regard, so I\\'m lucky I got you as an interviewer. \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark and Agent Neilson both chuckle.) \\n Agent Neilson: Anyway, I still silently cursed up a storm when it finally succeeded and flew off into the forest. After kicking myself, I decided to thoroughly prepare to face off against it and make the opening I didn\\'t get earlier. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: And what did you do to prepare? \\n Agent Neilson: Double-checked the Antikinetoglyphs, gathered up as many working guns and unempty mags as I could, and even modified a visor to fit around my new head, in case that thing had cognitohazards up its sleeves too. I also had a theory I wanted to test. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: The one you announced when you came in guns blazing, about Belette Le Fou(ine) feeling the forest\\'s pain? \\n Agent Neilson: That\\'s the one! I first noticed it double-over in pain when it deflected a Gauss round that felled a few trees. I couldn\\'t be sure though, since it might have just been the fresh pain from those two lucky shots, combined with the effort it clearly took to cast Kinetohazards with just one arm. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: And you did that rather bold pronouncement on just a theory? \\n Agent Neilson: My original plan was to just get it within my sights while staying hidden, fire on a tree, and see how it reacted, then play it by ear from there. \\n (Agent Neilson tugs on one of his ears.) \\n Agent Neilson: Probably not much better than what I did end up doing, all things considered. Unfortunately, when I finally found Belette Le Fou(ine), it was trying to blind that poor girl, and was probably about to torture the rest of them too. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: So you decided to use yourself as a distraction? \\n Agent Neilson: Pretty much. As crazy as that was, my hunch paid off and it all worked out in the end. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Yes, once again, everything worked out, despite you being so stubborn, so… \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark\\'s eyes widen and she stifles a laugh.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: So… (Giggles.) Bull-Headed… \\n (Dr. Sawkingbark and Agent Neilson burst out laughing.) \\n Agent Neilson: Quite literally now! \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Anyway. (Clears throat.) That does it regarding the incident. I just have a few more questions. \\n Agent Neilson: Sure, go ahead. \\n (Agent Neilson points at his head. Dr. Sawkingbark giggles and clears her throat again.) \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Have you experienced any unusual dreams or daytime compulsions since becoming a Therianthrope? \\n Agent Neilson: Heh, aside from cravings for wheatgrass smoothies, not really. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: (Laughs.) Are you just joking right now, Terrance? \\n Agent Neilson: No, I\\'m serious. Vegan diet\\'s been looking a lot more appealing lately. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Huh, that\\'s interesting. Hopefully you\\'ve been looking into the right Portlands restaurants then. (Winks.) \\n Agent Neilson: You bet I have! Honestly, even after I get cured, I\\'m not sure I\\'ll ever be able to eat a burger again. Not after having been one. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Don\\'t say that! There\\'s always those impossible burgers. \\n Agent Neilson: You\\'re right. I guess that\\'s an option now. Anyway, anything else? \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Well, I need to know your thoughts on Sandra Collins. \\n Agent Neilson: (Sighs.) A poor, desperate girl. Not the first time I\\'ve dealt with a runner, and likely not the last. We see it a lot with nascent reality benders we\\'re forced to contain. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: So her escape hasn\\'t affected you, then? Or her threat of suicide? \\n Agent Neilson: Not really. Hopefully we can find her while she\\'s still sane enough to be talked down, before her abilities wipe away that sanity. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: Thank you, Agent Neilson. \\n Agent Neilson: Anytime, Dr. Sawkingbark. Hopefully we can have more interviews in the future. \\n Dr. Sawkingbark: I hope so too! And if not, I\\'m always here for you anyway, Terrance. \\n <End Log, 2021-06-10, 10:15 PST> \\n « SCP-6089 | SCP-6090 | SCP-6091 » \\n Cite this page as: \\n \"SCP-6090\" by ChaosMageX, from the SCP Wiki.

The purpose of these attacks are not currently known. Proceed with caution. \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n Specialized Testing Chamber ζ-28-41 \\n SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: Due to the inherent nature of the anomaly\\'s activation conditions within human biology, SCP-6969 cannot be contained at this time. Efforts are directed towards nullifying the thaumaturgical activation of SCP-6969 on a global scale via application of the Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String. Regardless, as SCP-6969\\'s effects are self-censoring and global neutralization would be immensely costly, this is considered a low priority. \\n Access to this file is restricted to individuals with Level 5/6969 clearance to prevent panic amongst wider Foundation personnel. Due to the large amount of individuals attempting to access this file for unknown reasons, editing the file has been locked, and requires O5 or Research Lead credentials. \\n DESCRIPTION: SCP-6969 is the designation for a thaumaturgic biological process which occurs during ejaculation. \\n When a human being attempts to discharge — whether during the process of intercourse or, more commonly, not — a series of internal thaumaturgic processes occur within the individual\\'s genitalia, affecting the entire body. Over the duration of approximately two seconds, the affected subject will enter and experience a causal time loop, repeatedly beginning at the moment of ejaculation and lasting a short period of time. No changes to the subject\\'s physiology are preserved between time loops, save for two factors: one, the activity of the nervous system, and two, sperm\\'s genetic composition (where applicable).1 \\n Upon conclusion of an unknown number of repetitions, the causal time loop ceases, and a secondary thaumaturgic effect activates. The secondary effect resets the nervous system to the state it was when the time loop began, allowing for the seamless transition between pre- and post-orgasm states by resetting memory. Following this, anomalous activity relating to SCP-6969 ceases. \\n Research suggests that affected subjects may experience a subjective time of anywhere from sixteen days to roughly seventy-three quintillion years every ejaculation.\\n  \\n   \\n SUBJECT DESIGNATION: D-652589 \\n SUBJECT SEX: MALE \\n TESTING LOCATION: Specialized Testing Chamber ζ-28-41 \\n PROCEDURE: A counterspell on the secondary thaumaturgic process was activated on D-652589. The subject was instructed to masturbate, which was performed without complication. \\n RESULT: Immediate liquefaction of subject\\'s nervous system. Analysis of subject\\'s ejaculate confirmed changes to genetic material. \\n   \\n SUBJECT DESIGNATION: D-80O7135 \\n SUBJECT SEX: FEMALE \\n TESTING LOCATION: Specialized Testing Chamber ζ-28-41 \\n PROCEDURE: A specialized thaumaturgic spell is placed upon D-8007135 which modifies the SCP-6969 process, allowing for the entire body to be preserved between time loops. Subject was informed and consented to the experiment prior, and was instructed to masturbate. \\n RESULT: Subject immediately disintegrates. \\n   \\n SUBJECT DESIGNATION: D-05370 AND D-908707 \\n SUBJECT SEX: MALE AND FEMALE \\n TESTING LOCATION: Specialized Testing Chamber ζ-28-41 \\n PROCEDURE: Subjects were previously married and were reported to possess \"unresolved sexual tension\" in D-Class holding areas. Both were informed of the nature of the experiment and begrudgingly agreed. D-05370 was thaumaturgically modified to retain memories of their experience during SCP-6969. D-908707 was not modified. Both were non-invasively recorded during the process. \\n RESULT: D-05370 became comatose, and D-908707 became immensely distressed and uncooperative. Latter amnesticized; former is in medical wing pending termination order. \\n   \\n ALL TESTING HALTED BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE. \\n   \\n   \\n When I began working on SCP-6969, I initially tackled it with the idea that this was a malicious force I was working against. I think, in one way or another, we all believed that this anomaly was evil, or created by something evil to do evil upon us. How many anomalies were the result of eldritch horrors? Surely this must be one of them. But, as I stand here before my research and the evidence piles on my desk, I have to conclude that the theme we\\'re seeing isn\\'t a malicious force — it\\'s a natural one. \\n The process of evolution is one which is cobbled together from random happenstance. Genes change at complete random and anything which is potentially beneficial (or at least not harmful) gets passed down, while those which are harmful get killed off. It\\'s brutal and messy, but it works — just barely. And, the theory goes, SCP-6969 is the result of just one of those many, many evolutionary happy-little-accidents which may help pass on some genes. \\n SCP-6969, as we know, changes the genetic material of the sperm released during ejaculation. From what we can tell, it also prunes a significant amount of unhealthy specimens and increases sperm count in general. All signs point to it having simply evolved over the course of our species\\' lifespans, creating vastly improved genetic material in a tiny timespan. When SCP-6969 first came into existence, there may have been a significant amount of casualties by people who experienced it without the secondary effects, until one person evolved the ability to reset the nervous system and SCP-6969 simultaneously. Any descendants of theirs not up to par were killed off in the process of natural selection. \\n There is, perhaps, one hypothesis of a colleague of mine which I am too afraid to admit may be true. From the complexity of SCP-6969, we can place the approximate period from where it evolved, and it appears as though the time corresponds directly with the development of higher intelligence in human species. As if to make matters worse, the hypothesis goes on to state that without SCP-6969, the genetic makeup of humans may become significantly more unstable, resulting in very high birth defect rates and fatal mutations. \\n I cannot fathom a world of such suffering, where we were conceived in such brutal conditions, made to endure such horrors, and die an eventual, meaningless death. \\n Sex is a joke. \\n And we\\'re the punchline. \\n Following this, Head Researcher Nathan Brown was disciplined for adding unprofessional personal anecdotes to official SCP files. \\n « SCP-6968 | SCP-6969 | SCP-6970 »\"', 'SCP-6972': '\"This page doesn\\'t exist. \\n This page may have been moved or deleted, or it may have never existed.
